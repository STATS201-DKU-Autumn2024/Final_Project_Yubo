Such a old school top notch service and food like no where else around . Complimentary carved cheese,dried sausage and the best bruschetta you ever had.  Started out with meatballs with ricotta cheese wow little balls of heaven.  Baked clams with such a succulent sauce everyone dipped there bread into. I had to order the double cut veal chop with roasted potatoes oh my so divine. Also ordered veal Milanese that's the size of the plate. Veal Marsala ,chicken salitimbocca , spaghetti Abbriatta , rigatoni carbonara all perfectly cooked and tasted so heavenly. Then all the waiters came out to sing Happy Birthday with plate of 4 different cakes.  Such a perfect night with my family and good food nothing a man can ask for more of Bill will be a mortgage payment but worth every penny. Thanks for making my day special.",0
18034,"Title: A Delightful Dive into Familiar Flavors at Bleecker Street Gem

As someone who grew up savoring Armenian dishes, the anticipation for this culinary experience was sky-high. My cousins, seasoned patrons of this establishment, suggested making a reservation, which turned out to be a savvy move, even though we were greeted by a surprisingly serene atmosphere during our 2 PM visit.

The restaurant, nestled in the bustling enclave of Bleecker Street, impressed with its charming layout. Tables stretched along the wall, leading to a quaint garden-esque area, reminiscent of a greenhouse. This space, bathed in light yet shielded from the elements, offered a tranquil escape.

Our culinary adventure was a parade of delectable choices: Tolma, perfectly sautéed mushrooms, a bright Georgian salad, the crowd-pleasing Adjaruli Khachapuri, flavorful Kubdari, velvety mushrooms with cheese, and a sumptuous pork shish kebab with potatoes. Washed down with the unique tarragon soda, each dish was a hit, particularly the sautéed mushrooms, Khachapuri, and Kubdari. The Georgian salad provided a crisp respite among the more indulgent offerings.

By meal's end, we had feasted to the brink of discomfort, a testament to the irresistible allure of the cuisine. This meal was not just nourishment but a nostalgic journey for the taste buds. The anticipation for a return visit is already whetting my appetite.",1
12483,"Everything about this spot is rave worthy. My friend had gone before with his wife and had been talking about it for months and finally we got together to check it out. This particular Chinese cuisine is from Xinjiang (hence the name Jiang) in the northwestern region. I'm not great with signaling out each region of China's different foods but from what I can tell it has definitely some Himalaysian - Nepal vibes with their spices. Lots of cumin, no pork on the menu, rich and fragrant. We split some of their sour cabbage and fresh radishes with sweet and sour sauce to start. Both were good palate cleansers to me but I think I was eating with people that eat relatively healthy and not the type to load up on carbs. Anyway, I did because I'm a fatty and ordered the stir fried cumin noodles with lamb. A huge pow of flavor and the meat was so tender. A little bit of heat but not too much. The wheaten dishes also caught my eye because you can basically design your own preference of noodle, the protein, sauce, and spice level for those dishes. The best part of the place is that it's byob without any kind of corkage fee. The place is tiny and pretty busy so I'd recommend getting there early or getting an online yelp reservation. A little expensive - but not overly so. You'll end up spending around $20-30 here and hey, at least you saved on booze.",0
20613,"As someone who isn't typically enamored with pizza, I was pleasantly surprised by my experience at this pizzeria. Their pizza dough is unique, reminiscent of the soft, chewy texture of naan bread. We decided on the Porcini Tartufo and the Tartufatta, both of which were an absolute delight with their rich flavors and perfectly soft dough. They were so good, in fact, that we ordered a third Porcini Tartufo, this time adding prosciutto to one half, which only amplified the deliciousness. Whether you're a pizza aficionado or a skeptic, I wholeheartedly recommend giving this place a try for a truly delightful culinary experience.",1
13010,"Title: Cozy Spot for Late Night Bites and Sips

I recently swung by this local gem for a late-night refuel after a fun evening of bar-hopping. As a tourist from DC, with my friend hailing from Philly, we were thrilled to find such a welcoming spot right by our accommodation. My companion, a repeat patron, couldn't wait to indulge in their cauliflower tacos again, a testament to their appeal—especially for plant-based foodies. While I didn't sample the tacos myself, her verdict was a resounding ""yummy!""

The drinks here deserve a mention—potent and well-crafted, they hit the spot perfectly. Aside from the fare, the ambience and decor added a lovely touch to our visit, creating an inviting and charming atmosphere that I could easily recommend for a quaint date night or a relaxed evening with friends. All in all, a definite thumbs up for this eatery.",1
16270,"Title: A Cozy Spice Haven in Times Square

I recently visited a restaurant that took me straight back to my days in China with its authentic malatang. Despite arriving just before our reservation on a busy Monday evening, the friendly host accommodated us immediately. Our waitress was full of great recommendations, which led us to try the fish malatang and dry pot.

The fish malatang hit the perfect note of spiciness, abundant with fish, fresh vegetables, and noodles, all swimming in a delicious, flavorful broth. It was just the kind of comfort food one craves on a crisp New York fall night.

But the highlight was undoubtedly the dry pot. After selecting our desired meats and vegetables at the counter, we waited with anticipation for our medium spicy creation. It arrived sizzling, accompanied by two bowls of rice, and did not disappoint – it was an absolute delight.

While the iced tea was just satisfactory, the food prices and excellent service more than made up for it. I'm already looking forward to returning to this spot throughout the winter for my malatang fix. If you find yourself in Times Square, I heartily recommend this place for a taste of genuine malatang and dry pot.",1
20720,"Had a fantastic experience at this bustling eatery on a Saturday night around 9pm. Despite its popularity, we snagged a table for two without any wait. Highly recommend the scallops—they're outstanding! Don't miss out on the sake flight for an adventurous taste of three distinct types: dry, extra dry, and an unfiltered option, all for $16. An absolute treat for both foodies and sake enthusiasts!",1
1159,This is my favorite Korean restaurant. The tofu stew is delicious any flavor you get. The food is very fresh and the prices are extremely reasonable. I tried some of the meat dishes for the first time and they are really great too!! Can't recommend this place enough!,0
16731,"Title: A Decadent Celebration at Rainbow Room

I recently attended an event at the Rainbow Room and was swept away by the opulence of the venue. Known for its extravagant brunch buffets and as one of Anthony Bourdain's early culinary playgrounds, the Rainbow Room exudes luxury and history.

The space is vast and airy, featuring wall-to-wall windows that offer an insane 360-degree panorama of the city. The interior design is simply stunning, enhancing the upscale atmosphere. Although it commands a premium price, it is worth every penny for those looking to celebrate a momentous occasion in a truly lavish setting.

The Rainbow Room's capacity is also impressive, capable of accommodating hundreds, perhaps even a thousand guests without feeling crowded. For those with the means and desire for an extraordinary event space, the Rainbow Room is unequivocally a top-tier choice.",1
15596,"TLDR: Modern Cantonese bistro in Hell's Kitchen. Excellent food but costly. Expense account type of restaurant or if you just feel like treating yourself. Sleek interiors.So I had steered clear of Hakkasan for many years - I thought it would be a total tourist trap. However, one day I figured; let's spring the trap!Okay, people have mixed opinions of Hakkasan. I do love the way this restaurant looks, it's very much reminiscent of Las Vegas. The food here is very expensive. It is executed very well and they have great tasting dishes. So go in knowing that dinner for 2 will run you at least $200+ and you'll enjoy yourself. The dishes aren't huge but they do fill up.The cocktails here are very much works of art. The Smoked Negroni is quite a show. The menu does change but I recommend you try the steamed dim sum sampler. As expected, it's very over the top but if I'm paying this much - show me something I haven't seen before. The foie gras dim sum is pretty awesome.The shrimp curry is to die for. It's not too runny but mix it up with either white rice or a fried rice. You'll be glad you did. The shrimp is quite large and you can probably get 3 bites out of each.An appetizer, two entrees and a rice or noodle should be enough. So while the food is expensive, it is a place I do crave every once in awhile. Mostly for their drinks and that damn shrimp.",0
12612,This place never Disappoints. I've been coming here for years and the food is always amazing. The place offers a lively Spanish vibe w music and hookah. It's the perfect place to hang out worth girlfriends or for a date. No reservations needed.,0
1464,"I always try to take my mom to omakase at least once a year, especially when we are (or she is visiting me) in New York.  This city has numerous (and growing) sushi bars that specialize in omakase.  Omakase is probably my favorite indulgence - it's great to just focus on the food, having that one-on-one relationship with your sushi chef, learning about the different pieces of fish, and seeing what they can create.It's slightly difficult to rate omakase because there are so many individual pieces.  However, I will just upload the pictures and give a generalized review of the service, food, and atmosphere in general. PROS:- very fresh, you can't go wrong with this.  My mom also has a very sensitive GI and if there is any issues with freshness, she will be in the bathroom later that day/night.- good quantity of fish/nigiri pieces- nice combinations of flavors: not as purist as one would imagine so if this is something that you were hoping for, it's going to be a bit outside of your comfort zone.- great service: water was always refilled, plates always changed.- very friendly chef who was knowledgeable not just about the craft but also had significant training in Asia and US before Ishikawa.CONS:- slightly cramped. It would be fine in the summer but with all the coats and bags, it has a homey yet tight feeling.  Typical New York if you're used to it but at the same time, I would like maybe 1/4 feet on each side of me.  I already recommended this place to a friend who lives just one avenue away haha, it was really good.  Definitely would come here if I was living in his building!",0
12426,"Title: A Brunch Buzz with Room for Culinary Improvement

I swung by this spot for what turned out to be quite the bustling brunch party. A talented DJ set the upbeat ambience, which was complemented by the bartenders who certainly knew their craft—those drinks were not for the faint-hearted! However, the food lineup didn't quite hit the high notes; the menu options felt overpriced and, judging from the less-than-impressive dishes neighboring tables received, I opted to stick with the spirited libations. The experience makes me curious about their regular menu, so a return visit might be on the cards. For now, it's a thumbs up for the drinks and vibes, but the kitchen needs to step up its game to truly make it a feast for all the senses.",1
10912,"Title: A Culinary Jewel at the Hyatt Union Square

Nestled inconspicuously in the Hyatt Union Square's lobby, this restaurant proves itself to be an unassuming treasure. Their culinary offerings, sampled across breakfast, lunch, and dinner, consistently impress with their vibrant flavors and palpable freshness.

The small plates, perfect for pairing with a cocktail, are standouts; particularly the Brussel sprouts and the creamy burrata. Morning diners will delight in the rich ricotta toast and the dishes adorned with fresh avocado, both of which are tinged with deliciousness.

Not to be overlooked is their happy hour—an ode to the good life with treats like smooth hummus, blistered shisito peppers, aromatic marinated olives, and the irresistible lure of $6 wines.

This spot has become my trusted haven for a quality food experience in the area. Whether it's the beginning of a new day or an evening unwind, their offerings are always on point.",1
3571,"My metrics for picking a solid Mexican restaurant involves numerous variables including (a.) location, (b.) food quality, (c.) speed of service and (d.) choice flexibility. On all accounts, this restaurant hit the spot. It's affordable especially for its location on 2nd avenue and offers bar seating with high-top tables plus an array of other tables that allow for easy/quick service. Though we missed their weekday happy hour special (which apparently offer true ""steals""), there was no lack of selection. Their nachos dish is special for its heaping mound of chips, peppers and salsa smothered in enough baked cheese to make you feel like you're unique. I ordered the plate of fish tacos which included mango salsa and smooth-textured sour cream and, yet again, created a special aroma that felt, well, special.  We were ""in and out"" within 40 minutes, with just enough time to spare for trivia at the nearby Cornerstone Tavern bar up the street. This place is great! Don't miss it.",0
14742,"I wandered into Nish Nush based on the Yelp reviews and because I had theater tickets nearby and it looked like a good place to eat solo. I was not disappointed. The menu is a mix of vegan and vegetarian options, and definitely Mediterranean/Middle Eastern inspired. Sandwiches are served with a little cup of pickles and an olive. The falafel platter seemed to be a highlight. The atmosphere is a bit industrial with an open kitchen and a few hightop tables - definitely not great for a big group, but good for solos and small groups. There were several people that ordered takeout while I was there.On to my food: I ordered a lemonade with ginger and tumeric to drink, and it was delightful. They add a sprig of fresh mint as well, so it was light, refreshing, and not too sweet. The chunks of ginger and tumeric added a pleasant spiciness as well. For my meal, I ordered a cauliflower shug pita sandwich, opted for the wheat pita, and added beets. It was amazing. The cabbage added a good crunch, the cauliflower was roasted and sweet, the beets added a nice earthiness, the egg had a creamy yolk, and the harissa added a nice kick. My only complaint was that the pita was so overstuffed it was a bit messy! (A good complaint to have.) I was concerned I would still be hungry after a pita of veggies and egg, but not at all. Overall, a small gem in Tribeca. I'll definitely return when I'm in the neighborhood.",0
16983,Great food & lively atmosphere. I came for a birthday party and had a great time with friends. The food lived up to the reviews and presentation was nice. I would say the menu is a bit pricey for some items especially the pitchers of sangria and the cost per glass. But if you go out to a restaurant downtown you're usually going to pay a bit more. Portions look small but are very filling. I would come back and order the taco try again with a side of the guacamole. The steak tacos were my favorite. So tasty and full of flavor. It was delicious! Great experience in my opinion.,0
1358,"When I think of stellar Asian Fusion food that remains true to its roots while still reflecting a bit of Western flair, Tuome is exemplary. We came at 5:30 on a Saturday which imo was a perfect time - no wait time for seats or food to be served, and got service centered around our experience (only one other table came in right at 5:30, but it started to get full around 6:30). Our server was wonderful, always checking in with us and well-versed with the menu, and the server for our water was very attentive and never left our glasses empty. What we got  - the quail appetizer (you HAVE to get this), the crab noodle and pig out for mains, the rice and broccoli for sides, and the beignets for desserts. Bill without tip was $164 (also got sparkling water). Alright deets time. The quail is served with sweet and savory sauce and roasted to crispy perfection, so if you only want one appetizer, you better get this. The Pig Out is not like traditional pork belly. It's shredded pork, shaped into a cube, under crispy skin with a perfect ratio of fat and meat (I personally like this better than just seeing the layer of fat on the traditional pork belly), served with a perfect compliment of sweet peanut noodles and salad. The crab noodles are buttery and creamy, and all their noodle dishes use a thick, chewy (egg?) noodle that makes the dish feel hearty and filling. So if you like thick noodles (think hand-pulled asian noodles), then you'll love the texture of these dishes. I am a huge fan of the broccoli (so much umami), and the rice is like lotus leaf rice but more rich (probably from the duck fat)! The beignet is like mantou, so if you like mantou, get this! Everything we got on the menu, the server noted was the exact order he would get dining here, and he seemed to be honest since these were the dishes we overheard him recommending other tables! Normally my bf and I like to mention things we'd change about the dish, but there was truly nothing to critique about the food. This is one of the top places we've dined at, and I 100% would come here over and over again.",0
2765,"I revisited this charming spot for their Happy Hour, now a Monday-to-Friday affair despite the outdated daily claim online. The cocktail selection, priced attractively at $10 each compared to the usual $15+, did not disappoint, offering more variety than before, with every sip as delightful as the last.

My taste buds were once again wowed by the Monkfish Katsu – a dish so divine it was the sole reason for my return. The combination of fresh, tender monkfish with a light, crispy coating and savory Katsu sauces left me enamored. The culinary surprises continued with the Cottage Fries; their addictive crunch and perfect fluffiness inside introduced me to a new favorite.

On the downside, the Harrisa Wings missed the mark. They were a bland letdown with lukewarm serving temperatures that dimmed the experience somewhat.

In sum, this eatery is certainly a cute haunt to unwind at, especially with their fantastic monkfish Katsu on the menu – a must-try for any visitor.",1
14413,"Title: A Feast for Hot Pot Lovers at an Affordable Price

If you're a hot pot aficionado, this restaurant offers a pretty good all-you-can-eat experience for $30. The luxury of personal hot pots means you can choose from a selection of broths and tailor your meal to your taste. The variety on the menu is commendable, with a plethora of choices from succulent meats to fresh seafood, crisp veggies, various noodles, and delectable items like fishballs and meatballs. While drinks are an extra charge, the quality of the ingredients justifies the price, aligning with the city's standard for AYCE hotpot.

Celebrating a birthday? This spot turns the heat up with a celebratory free AYCE meal complete with a birthday song and a complimentary bowl of ice cream topped with a candle — a delightful touch. The service is as attentive as the simmering broth, and with reservations accepted, you can skip the wait and dive straight into the deliciousness. For hot pot fans, this restaurant is a go-to for both a casual dinner and a special occasion.",1
10991,"Love love love this spot! There are so many overpriced and underwhelming modern Indian restaurants in NYC that totally disappoint but trust me, you'll walk out amazed and satisfied after your experience at Indian accent. When you walk in, the service is so nice from the beginning. They take in your coats for coat check too!The ambiance inside is simple yet classy. There is a bar area in the front where you can grab a drink and the dining area is relatively big too. Our server was ridiculously nice and helpful too! She made our experience memorable. We started with compliments from the chef, it was so good. They treated us with blue cheese naan and a pumpkin coconut soup. Sounds like strange ingredients but they all were so tasty and savory. We decided to do a two course dinner. It comes with two courses along with an accompaniment (so basically 3 course). First we had the Assamese pork dumplings and the duck vadai and they were so good. They put a soup over the dumplings and they complemented the taste so well. There was fried vermicelli on top of the duck and it was amazing. Next we had (as accompaniments) corn and spinach - basically saag and corn and it was so good. We also had the butter chicken kulcha and it was creamy and delicious.For our entrees, we got the ghee roasted lamb and gun pepper scallops. The ghee roasted lamb comes with four chutneys and small roomali rotis (you basically make tacos out of them) and the lamb was so soft and the gravy was very savory and seasoned perfectly. The scallops came with cauliflower in a creamy sauce and they were so good too. We lastly got the carrot halwa for dinner and it came with pistachio ice cream and it was the perfect way to end the meal. We even got the jasmine pearl tea after and it was refreshing. Overall very happy with my experience here and can't wait to come here again for another special occasion! This place isn't cheap, so make the most of it!",0
2492,"Title: Grand Opening Delight at Joju

I couldn't resist sharing my excitement after partaking in Joju's grand opening BOGO deal. The queue was manageable, and the staff operated like a well-oiled machine.

My choice was the bulgogi sandwich with spicy mayo - a flavor-packed delight with an ideal crunch, although the spicy mayo was a tad overpowered by the savory bulgogi; a little tweak there wouldn't go amiss for those of us who love a good kick.

The spring rolls, a personal benchmark for Vietnamese cuisine, did not disappoint. Their unique, elongated shape was charming, and the taste was spot-on, authentic. However, at $4.55 for two, I find them slightly overpriced and might skip them on future visits.

I'm already looking forward to sampling their bowls and beverages. Joju seems like a much-needed addition to midtown, and considering the turnout, it's clear I'm not alone. A little suggestion: a loyalty program could be the cherry on top, and a review of the spring roll pricing might endear customers even more.

All in all, Joju, you're off to a fantastic start—best of luck, and see you again soon!",1
18004,"Dining at this understated gem was an experience not soon to be forgotten. The ambiance is casually inviting with a touch of urban chic, thanks to the exposed brick walls. Seating is limited, so reservations are a must—and with the buzz this place is sure to generate, book early.

Offering a choice between two thoughtfully curated menus, The Tasting Menu at $68 for 6 courses, or The Chef's Pass at $120 for 10 courses, patrons can decide the depth of their culinary journey. Though the Chef's Pass excludes the coconut veloute, it's a negligible miss amidst the flood of rich, imaginative dishes you're treated to. And it's worth every penny; satisfaction is guaranteed both in taste and quantity.

Opting for The Chef's Pass meant a ringside seat to an impressive display of culinary artistry. The menu is touted as modern global, but expect your palate to be whisked away to the aromatic lands of India and the Middle East, woven through with subtler accents from other cuisines.

The meal began with fireworks in the form of the Butternut Squash with crispy lentils, followed by a procession of standout dishes like the inventive Hamachi adorned with a chili that surprises with contrasting heat and temperature, the perfectly tender Mussels in a harmonious nuoc cham sauce, and the debut of the decadent Broken Rice Porridge, a trifecta of uni, corn, and generous shavings of truffle.

While there were some minor timing issues between courses, this hardly detracted from the overall enjoyment. Not all dishes were flawless; the Eastside Breakfast was over-seasoned, yearning for something to temper its saltiness, and the Monkfish could have benefited from a bolder shiso presence. The Veal, though, was a triumph—tender and beautifully complemented by the lingonberry gochujang.

To end, an Aromatic Rice Ice Cream that, despite a slightly thick texture, married well with the tang of raspberry snow and the sweetness of mango lassi caramel.

Lasting three hours, the BYOB Chef's Pass seating is a commitment, but one rewarded with gastronomic excellence. The chef's exacting standards ripple through every dish, and his team's skill is undeniable. I'm already planning my next visit.",1
17477,"I had the privilege to dine at a restaurant that offers an exclusive ramen experience with a limited production of just 20-25 bowls per day, and it's imperative that you try it. Without exaggeration, it was the best ramen I've ever tasted. The portion was generous, and both the broth and pork were phenomenally delicious - every slurp was a testament to its superiority. It's the kind of dish that would beckon me back without a second thought. Additionally, their karage made for an excellent appetizer, perfectly setting the stage for the star of the show. Don't miss out; make sure to order these delights.",1
3396,"Haven't you always wanted to eat a burger with some lobster, without the ridiculous pricing of a seafood restaurant? Well this is the place for you!My friends and I each ordered the Combo for 1 which included a burger, 1lb of lobster (steamed/grilled), salad, fries, and a drink! Let me note that this will not be the best burger of your life, nor will the lobster be as amazing as a restaurant that specializes in seafood, but for about $50 after tax and tip, this is quite a filling meal considering you only had to go to 1 spot to get both meals. The burger was just a normal burger. Nothing too extraordinary regarding toppings, but it certainly was filling. You can get the lobster either steamed or grilled. Keep in mind that the grilled version is naturally more dry since they steam it first, and then put it on the grill afterwards for more flavor. The salad and fries complimented the meal quite well and the included drink makes it worth it. Nice place to go to if you want both burgers and lobsters for a relatively affordable price, but if you want the best NY has to offer regarding burgers or lobsters, I'd recommend going somewhere else.",0
20008,"Title: A Cozy Slice of Georgia with Some Service Hiccups

Upon stepping into this charming eatery, my nostalgia for Tbilisi's vibrant streets was instantly rekindled. The ambiance is genuinely Georgian and whisked me back to the Caucasus with ease. Although the absence of Rose Brut and chicken Khinkali on the menu was a minor letdown, the selection of sparkling wines provided a delightful and affordable compromise to my aversion to Georgian wines.

We commenced with a yogurt-based appetizer that surprised me with its liquid form, unlike the Taziki I had anticipated, yet it did not disappoint on flavor. The highlight, though, was the steaming hot mushrooms drenched in a glorious blanket of melted cheese – an absolute palate pleaser!

Although craving the chicken or perhaps a vegetarian potato Khinkali, our options were limited to the pork and beef variations, which I hope the restaurant might expand on in the future. The main course, a beautifully cooked salmon paired with creamy mashed potatoes, was portioned perfectly for sharing and hit the mark on lightness and taste.

Regrettably, the service didn't mirror the culinary high points. It was a tad too relaxed for our liking, bordering on inattentive, which left my dining partner particularly disgruntled.

In summary, the evening was a delectable homage to Georgian cuisine, slightly marred by service that could benefit from a touch more attentiveness. Nevertheless, the restaurant remains a spot I'd recommend for a flavorful getaway to the heart of Georgia.",1
20262,"Title: A Cozy Corner That Feels Like Home

Upon entering this hidden gem, I was immediately won over by the thoughtful touches, right down to the elegant silverware. The service was exceptionally quick, setting the stage for a delightful dining experience on a soggy Sunday.

We were a trio seeking comfort, and comfort we found, without the slightest hint of being rushed. This added to the cozy ambiance, allowing us to savor our conversations as much as our meals.

The bao bao noodles were the star of the show—affordably priced and evoking a nostalgic taste akin to a home-cooked meal by mom. Next visit, I'm aiming to pair those heartwarming noodles with their Thai tea. This place is a solid choice for anyone in search of a warm, hearty meal served with a side of serenity.",1
20193,"I recently dined at Tatsu, where the novel practice of placing orders at a kiosk piqued my interest. This method, while efficient in theory, didn't quite deliver on its promise. Despite the allure of a quick experience, my simple ramen order took an excessive 35 minutes to arrive.

Seated by the bustling bar, I could observe the kitchen's frenzied pace, yet the delayed service hinted at a disconnect, particularly given the pre-made broths. Thankfully, the ""old skool"" ramen eventually graced my palate with its delightful flavors.

While the taste was satisfying, the long wait dampened my enthusiasm. I'm hesitant to revisit Tatsu unless opting for delivery, hoping that it might mitigate the waiting issue.",1
19521,"I had an absolutely delightful culinary experience attending a retirement party at this gem of a restaurant. Every dish was a hit, from the succulent ribs and perfectly crispy fried chicken to the savory collard greens. The cornbread and mac & cheese offered comfort in every bite, reminding me of home-cooked meals. I was particularly surprised by the sweet yams; as someone who doesn't usually favor them, I was converted with the first taste. The sweet tea was the cherry on top, flawlessly capturing the essence of Southern refreshment. I'm eager for my next visit!",1
2965,"We gave this place a try during restaurant week, we arrived & were seated right away. To start we added the wine pairing & tried white & red both good w the meal. They start u off with some delicious bread so soft very tasty great w the added butter. Appetizer we had the Green salad & Calamari, good salad nice tasting dressing. Very good & large plate of Calamari. Main dishes we had the Filet mignon & Hanger steak, the filet mignon was amazing perfectly cooked great flavor , good Hanger steak as well for the sides we had Spinach & Mac & Cheese. Spinach was decent a little bitter but not bad, great Tasting Mac & cheese nice size portion, great when mixed together. For dessert the Apple pie w ice cream was very good & the Banana ice cream was delicious. Nice location, with plenty of seating simple yet elegant decor.. service was very good, prices for restaurant week were well worth it & much cheaper than the regular menu but the food was very good & definitely worth the try on it's own.",0
1512,"Overall, i had a great experience and an amazing time. I'll start off listing all the pros then end this review with the cons. The staffs are all very friendly, attentive, and willing to answer any question you have. I'm impressed by how attentive the waiters were despite all the people in there. The food tasted great. The bread is amazing, a bit crunch on the outside but moist and soft on the inside (just right and a nice subtle chewiness to it). The empanadas is interesting, it's more like a croissant then any traditional empanadas I've had but it still tasted really good and the braised pork was the right choice. Fritura de Bacalao was beautiful crisped and tender on the inside, the fish was fresh and I love the sauce. Ended up using the sauce with the bread too. Albóndigas was nice too, surprisingly light on the stomach and reminded me a little of soul food. Vieiras tastes great and the pistachio cava on the side was heaven, perfect with the scallops. Sorpresa Chocolate cake was slightly crisp on the outer layer and warm and runny melted chocolate inside. I enjoy the cream, wasn't too oily and pretty fresh. Good dessert but didn't wow me. The interior is beautiful and atmosphere is nice. Lots of seats and tables but usually busy. Mostly packed in evenings so highly recommend people to make reservations especially if it's more than 2 people. The main cons about this place is just it's so loud, my friend and I basically sat right in front of the door but we could barely hear each other without leaning in and speaking really loud. Gets a bit tiring and not great for people with hearing aids as it might be too loud for their liking. Very packed as I've mentioned so the seats are all really close together which makes it a bit suffocating. The price is a bit on the higher side and as the ingredients and the skill of the chef I had no problem. However, the portions are way too small that I don't feel like it's extremely worth the price and definitely had to spend way more just to be full and eating lots of bread. Great for someone who love trying a bit of everything and have a lot of money to spend, which not everyone would want to spend or can spend that much on just one meal. We basically spend around $100 after tips and (no drinks). We were just fine but weren't really full either. It's a place I'd recommend but will surely highlight the portion and price to whoever I'm recommended a tapas place to. I would like to come back but definitely didn't make it to my ""go-to list"" and would come in awhile since it's really expensive for something I can't really be filled up with. 2 people without drinks for sure can be around $80-$100. If both are drinking a couple drinks then it's an easy $150-$200 we are talking about here. So it really depends what you are looking for and what you want to get out of a restaurant or this experience. It's fun for dates but almost bad as well as it's so loud you can barely enjoy getting to know each other in a more relaxed environment, but if you like talking on top of your lungs you will love this place.

10241,We stopped in this bar for a quick drink on a Saturday evening before heading to our Broadway show.  The place was packed.  My friend who is a big time drinker didn't care and wanted to get her drink on. We stood for awhile and was luckily able to get some seats at the bar. We didn't venture to their upper floors. The vibe was cool and nice. They had reserved bar tables if you were ordering food.   I would hang out here again when in the neighborhood.,0
10837,"I've been enough times to tell you that if you like a good Sicilian slice like me, Famous Ben's won't let you down. I'd say it's an old time hidden gem of the neighborhood. While there's amazing pizza around here, I've never been disappointed by Ben's sicilian slices. The round pizza is just fine, but I love how thick and saucy the squares are. I think they've been particularly known for the sicilian so you'll be doing yourself a disservice by not ordering it. For something a little different, I've grown fond of the Palermo. It comes with sauteed onions ground up in a sauce. The flavors are distinct. It's on the slightly sweeter side, and I love how saucy it is. The grandma sicilian is always a great go to for something more familiar but still delicious. I'd say these are my go to orders. Otherwise, they have other toppings and a regular pizza if sicilian style isn't your thing. This is something as close as I can get to L&B in the city in terms of the squares. It's a super fast, casual restaurant. The place exudes that old school pizza restaurant. Definitely stop by if you want a good square slice on the go.",0
14334,"Tucked on the 2nd floor near Citibank, this gem of a restaurant is a delightful find with its reasonable prices and convenient location. The ambiance is charming, matched with warm and helpful staff who navigate the bustling crowd with ease - a testament to its popularity, as patrons continue to roll in even post-10pm. While you might encounter a bit of a wait over the weekend, it's well worth it for the delicious variety of drinks and dishes on offer. Overall, the experience leaves you satisfied and eager for a return visit. Highly recommended!",1
16851,"We wanted to grab lunch before taking the tram to Roosevelt Island. Came across this restaurant and was pleasantly surprised by the high quality of the food. What a great gem in the hood!It was a late lunch around 3pm so the restaurant was pretty empty. The server was very friendly. It's a corner restaurant so all the windows were opened which gave us a nice breeze. There are two flatscreen TVs by the bar.We had avocado toast, French toast, omelette with bacon, ham and mushroom with potatoes, egg Benedict with potatoes as well as bacon, eggs & cheese flatbread. Everything tasted fresh and amazing!Would love to come back again if I'm in the hood.",0
10135,"After longing to visit Chelsea Market, I finally made my way there, stepping into the bustling ambiance that doesn't disappoint. Despite a recently finished lunch, I couldn't resist indulging in two tacos and a refreshing horchata. My overall impression? A solid 4 out of 5 stars.

The adobada taco was the standout, with its tender, well-seasoned meat nestled in a sweet corn tortilla—a delightful balance of flavors, with a gentle kick of spice that the creamy horchata managed to soothe perfectly. The chicken taco didn't fall short either, boasting well-cooked meat that complemented the ensemble.

What lifts the meal beyond its 3.5-star food rating is the immersive experience. The noise level, decor, and attentive staff all contribute to a feeling that transports you straight to a lively taco stand in Mexico City. It's a place that makes you enjoy every bite and sip, promising a mini-getaway without leaving Manhattan. Definitely a must-try spot. ENJOY!!!",1
2737,"Title: A Poke Haven in the Heart of NYC

If you're scouring the city for an unpretentious gem that serves up a quick, healthy, and utterly delightful poke fix, look no further. This spot has become my go-to for a swift and satisfying bite when I'm not quite ready for a full meal. The poke here is a harmonious blend of fast service, nourishing ingredients, and flavors that justify every penny spent.

I'm particularly enamored with their seared Otoro bowl – it's a dish I've come back to time and time again, even documenting its evolution through photographs. The Otoro, when seared to perfection, is both warm and succulent. A scattering of crunchy garlic chips adds an irresistible textural contrast and a punch of flavor that elevates the bowl from good to unforgettable. In a city brimming with poke options, I have yet to find a rival that could dethrone this culinary masterpiece from being my top pick in NYC.",1
11512,"I felt like was back in Tijuana. Who doesn't love tacos?  I found this Lil gem while visiting NY.  The posted photos are what drew me in and I wanted to experience it for myself. This place is legit! It can get crowded but they they move quickly. Standing room only no sit down tables which makes for quick turn over. They also have aqua frescas like horchata and tamarindo.  The menu is simple which is nice.  I tried all three tacos. The pastor pork and carne asada beef were my absolute favorite. They do have chicken too. Get it ""con todo"" it comes with all the fresh toppings.",0
20012,"Title: A Memorable Mother-Daughter Date Night at an Aquatic Delight

Last night, I treated my mom to a unique dining experience at a local restaurant that turned out to be a delightful mother-daughter date. This wasn't your ordinary eatery—right from the get-go, we were captivated by the spacious interior adorned with live fish tanks. A visual treat, the establishment boasted a variety of sea life, including crabs, scallops, lobsters, and flounders artfully displayed across two floors.

Upon entry, we received a warm welcome and were quickly seated by the amiable staff. The twist here is that patrons can indulge in a spot of fishing—yes, fishing—within the restaurant! With assistance from an expert guide, my mom, who's usually far from the fishing type, managed to catch her own dinner, making for an exceptional and heartwarming experience.

To keep things legal and dry, the restaurant provided us with a ""fishing license"" and raincoats. The innovative menu allowed us to choose how we wanted our catch prepared. We caught a smallmouth bass and opted to have it grilled and served fresh. The grilled version could have used a bit more seasoning, but the fresh dish was a revelation—it came with a dipping sauce that was flavorful enough, though we didn't find much need for it.

While the appetizers—fried calamari, uni, edamame, and a couple of sushi rolls—were fresh and met our expectations, they weren't particularly standout items. Still, the overall quality was solid.

In summation, not only did the restaurant offer a sumptuous meal, but it also provided an engaging experience that my mom and I thoroughly enjoyed. It's a place that delivers fun and food in equal measure, making for an unforgettable date night. Highly recommended for those seeking a dining adventure with their loved ones.",1
16271,"Title: Pricing Outshines Quality at Local Thai Spot

I recently dined at a nearby Thai restaurant which failed to top my list of favorites. High prices were the first drawback; the menu is noticeably more expensive than neighboring eateries, particularly for lunch specials that other places offer at better rates.

I tried their drunken noodles previously – they were decent, yet didn't justify the premium cost. On my last visit, I opted for the grilled pork chop lunch special. Unfortunately, the meat was somewhat dry. Although a side sauce provided a bit of moisture, it could not entirely rescue the dish. The accompanying vegetables, however, were a refreshing touch, adding some much-needed texture and flavor to the plate.

The shrimp soup I sampled was a highlight, touted for its savory seasoning. The true star of the meal, though, was the sticky rice. Its soft, sweet, and well-executed taste left me wanting more, a delightful end to an otherwise unremarkable meal. In summary, while there were elements to appreciate, the overall experience did not live up to the cost, and I'll be looking to other local options for my Thai cravings.",1
12973,"We had a really nice meal here on our last night of our vacation. My husband and I had been at a comedy show, so we ended up having a late meal. Lots of the other pizza places in the area were still really busy being a Friday night. Luckily Denino's worked out perfectly for us. We didn't end up getting pizza, but the food we did get was satisfying. We started with a caesar salad and mozzarella sticks. I am always a fan when things are made in house, which you could definitely tell with the mozzarella sticks. We then split the creamy farfalle pasta. We had excellent service as well. I also liked how the front windows were open to the street, so it almost felt like you were on a patio. I'm glad we ended up coming here!",0
1700,"It was just OK. My friends and I never had Spanish food so we decided to check this place out--made reservations at 12:30 pm and were seated immediately. -Gambas Al Ajillo ($16) Shrimp was way too salty so it was difficult to finish. -Socarrat Paella($28)It was my first time trying paella but it was definitely lacking something. Everyone thought it was bland and needed more seasoning. It was missing a lot of flavor which was highly disappointing. -Bistec De Buey ($24) This entree consists of skirt steak, spanish ratatouille, and fries. It was honestly the only dish that I was able to eat. Overall, this place has a great ambiance but the food didn't meet my expectations. Service was amazing though!",0
10712,"Last night, my friends and I descended upon a bustling Harlem eatery, a hidden gem nestled across from Fairway's on the tranquil stretch of 12th Avenue and 133rd Street, for a girl's night to remember. The grilled salmon paired with coconut shrimp made for a dynamic duo, thanks to a sauce that married the flavors beautifully, though a touch less salt would have been perfect.

One of my companions savored the curry goat, its authentic Jamaican zeal tantalizing the taste buds. While the fried snapper scored highly on presentation, its flavor was engulfed by an overly enthusiastic batter, a slight misstep saved by the gentle sauce provided as its counterpart.

The highlight, perhaps, was the happy hour—their $8 cocktails providing both solace and celebration. Catching envious glimpses of the bar menu's chicken wings, we've already planned our return. Harlem, we'll be back for more.",1

20198,"Title: A Hidden Gem with Consistent Quality

My wife and I first discovered this cozy restaurant back in late 2017, nestled just around the corner from our hotel. Its convenience led us to dine there multiple times during that trip. Fast forward to our latest visit, this time with our daughters in tow, we made a point of returning despite staying in a different part of the city.

The eatery has maintained its exceptional standard of food, a reassuring sign as we walked into a bustling scene on a Saturday afternoon. Our family feasted on a variety of dishes, including the fresh summer spring rolls, savory Cantonese noodles, flavorful duck curry, and the delightful pineapple fried rice. Each dish offered a distinct level of spiciness, clearly and accurately noted on the menu, catering to all our palates.

A standout for dessert is their coconut rice pudding; an enigmatic treat we've been drawn to since our first visit, and one we were excited for our girls to try. It didn't disappoint and remains a must-have.

Situated on 9th, the restaurant's slightly off-track location is a boon, sparing diners the stress of long lines commonly found at establishments of this quality. Prices don’t bite, and the portions are generous, adding to the appeal.

On the downside, the restaurant's compact size might cause a bit of a squeeze at your table. But, considering the delicious food and welcoming atmosphere, it's a minor inconvenience. This spot is a testament to good things coming in small packages, encouraging diners to mingle a bit closer.

In conclusion, if you find yourself in the area, make a point to visit. This restaurant is a culinary treasure well worth the detour.",1
18664,"Title: A Refreshing New Hangout in K-Town

I recently visited the newest self-serve bar in Ktown and it was quite the revelation! The place boasts a spacious seating arrangement, offering the luxury to stand, sit at the bar, or grab a table with ample personal space. With a variety of beers on tap, including lights, darks, and ciders, beer enthusiasts can rejoice. The unique by-the-ounce charging system is perfect for those who love to sample without overindulging, like myself.

Impressively, the food here transcends typical bar fare, striking a balance between less greasy options and classic comfort foods like wings, mozzarella sticks, burgers, and sandwiches. The ambiance strikes the right chord with adequate lighting and a music volume that encourages conversation, making it ideal for group outings.

A quick tip: Don’t miss out on the Mango Cart for a light, delightful option, but you might want to skip the Pineapple Cider unless you have a sweet tooth—it's a bit heavy on the apple. Overall, this new spot is a hit for both beer connoisseurs and foodies looking for a chill place to unwind.",1
3120,"We came here for a birthday dinner and glad that we chose this spot! Unfortunately, they do not take reservations, but you're free to roam around RH while you wait which is always fun. There's about 4 floors to explore while you wait or you can just lounge around while you wait. RH is a store to buy furniture, so when I say lounge around I literally mean you can be lounging on a coach or a bed etc... They also have a bar with drinks and coffee on the third floor for while you wait. The restaurant is beautiful, the decor is spot on and the staff were accommodating and super friendly! Their burrata was delicious, my only complaint was the bread was a little too hard. I had to of course get french fries which were delicious and I tried their salmon. The salmon was cooked to perfection; so soft that it  melted in your mouth! They have a beautiful view for their outdoor seating area, I went when it was cold out but I'll definitely be coming back again when it's warm to sit outside and enjoy the view.",0
18435,"After checking out places to eat in the area we decided to come here & give it a try, adding your name to the Yelp wait list is a good idea a lot of traffic in & out of this place. Appetizers to start the Steamed dumplings, these were ground pork & shrimp with soy sauce for dipping good dumplings, nice taste a bit on the heavy side not your typical steamed dumpling. we also had the Curry Puffs which are mined chicken wow these were delicious really great taste to them, even better with the sweet cucumber sauce. Main dishes I had the Krapraw Gai Sub this is minced chicken with onions, peppers & basil leaves, topped with fried egg on top of rice very tasty dish, good flavor to the chicken. My company had the Pad Se-ew , great tasting noodles good taste with the added chicken. Small location, nicely decorated & decent prices.. I was a bit torn on the stars because the food was good but what we had was decent but not over the top I settled on the 3 stars because we were not too pleased with the service being that it is a small location you really feel the rushed they serve quickly & try to get u off that chair just as quickly now I get u need that quick turn around but I am not a fan of being rushed through my meal takes away from enjoying the food properly.",0
12690,"I recently dined at Thai Villa, a restaurant whose aesthetics and gastronomic artistry had long piqued my interest, and I'm delighted to report it lived up to the hype. The establishment's beauty is consistent throughout, creating an alluring atmosphere right down to the meticulously adorned restrooms.

Arriving just ahead of the dinner rush, we were promptly seated, a fortune given the restaurant's popularity. To start, we indulged in the calamari and vegetable crepe dumplings, each dish an embodiment of culinary elegance. The main course of royal pad Thai continued the trend of impeccable presentation, and the meal culminated in a taro-filled sticky rice with coconut ice cream—a dessert so authentic it transported me back to Thailand with every bite.

Thai Villa offers a dining experience that delights both the palate and the eyes. It's a gem I eagerly anticipate returning to.",1
13612,"Title: Tasty Korean Fried Chicken in East Village

Rating: ★★★½

My visit to this Korean spot in the East Village proved to be a solid experience for fried chicken aficionados. Despite a slight hiccup with the opening time—11:30 a.m. instead of the advertised 11—there was no real inconvenience given the neighborhood's distractions. Upon entry, the prompt seating and swift service were commendable.

The soy garlic fried chicken had that crave-worthy crispy skin, though the sauce fell slightly short on the punchy flavor I’ve relished elsewhere in Flushing. For variety, their combo offerings hit the spot, giving a taste of both wings and drumsticks at a reasonable price. The beef bibimbap delighted with its crispy rice from the hot stone bowl, a true highlight. 

On the flip side, the seafood pancake sadly missed the mark with its limp texture. However, the japchae, spiked with jalapeño peppers, brought a welcome heat to the dish, making it a memorable part of the meal.

While not the pinnacle of Korean dining, the food quality and superb service make it a convenient, decent choice for the area. Prices align with what you'd expect for this cuisine, tipping my overall experience into a positive light.",1
19196,"I love this place! Not only is the space aesthetically beautiful, the food is delicious and thoughtfully produced. You can tell they care about how it looks as well as how it tastes.

I also love the location. Can't wait to try more!",0
14720,"Preface this review with the fact that this place is pretty new and will naturally improve with time. First off - the food is really great here. The chefs are doing their jobs and cranking out high quality items. Based on food alone this place is a solid 4 stars. We came during lunch and opted for the 3-course pre-fixe. It's a super reasonable price of $32/per person. I had the grilled octopus and dorade royal. The grilled octopus is excellent and the meat is super tender. The dorade was also really great - the meat was a white, delicate and flaky. It was so tender and juicy that it was as if it was steamed, but it was indeed grilled as verified by the grill marks on the skin! For dessert I had the Greek cake (I don't remember how to spell the actual name). It was pretty good, but by that time I was pretty tired and full.Secondly the ambiance here is amazing. The restaurant is very modern and airy. They also have floor to ceiling windows with a prime view of the Vessel and Hudson River. Very impressive place.So the food and ambiance sounded great, why the 3 stars? Well the service definitely needs to be ironed out. The restaurant is pretty big (for New York standards), but then they need to ensure they have a good waitstaff to table ratio. Our server was clearly overworked as he didn't come to take our order until nearly 30 minutes after we were seated. We ended up spending nearly 3 hours at the restaurant which was 1.5 hours too long for a 3-course lunch. On the plus side they gave us two servings of freshly baked bread with olive oil and fresh oregano. So I filled myself up with bread while we waited for our plates to arrive. If you decide to visit make sure you make reservations. Hudson Yards is hype right now so all of the restaurants are packed. Overall, I think the restaurant has great potential but the service and hosting needs to get ironed out a bit. As other reviewers have rightly mentioned, the host's seemed pretty confused and busy as they figure out which tables are available or not. They do not have time to greet guests with a smile. A place like this deserves an amicable host. I look forward to see this place make improvements!",0
17743,"Definitely pricey but worth it for a special occasion! I had the best wine of my life, and there's complimentary bread with a goat cheese marinara sauce.

10776,"This was the first restaurant we came to once we arrive to New York City. We ordered the soup that had spam,beans, pork belly and noodles, we also ordered peach soju.

Definitely would recommend coming here and we'll be back the next time we come to NYC.",0
10327,"Wow what a great experience!Lisa and her team were very welcoming from beginning to end, but not overbearing. They were constantly monitoring our water levels and would help us adjust the placement of our dishes. I came here with one other person and ordered for way more than two people's worth. We tried the Xiao Long Bao, Beef Tendons in Chili Oil, Cold Sesame Noodles, Spicy Grilled Whole Fish, and the Pea Shoots in Garlic Sauce. Honestly, everything was truly delicious - and I'm a pretty picky eater. My friend and I rarely agree that something is very outstanding and I felt like the food was here!The only thing spicy was the Grilled Whole Fish, so I wouldn't be deterred if you don't eat spicy food. The Grilled Fish, however, was my favorite on the menu. It was spicy, flavorful and was even packed with veggies (bok choy, yam noodles, oyster mushrooms)! I would maybe get this and 2 additional dishes for two people. Highly recommend this place!",0
18568,"3.5/5 BEST tagliatelle pasta I've ever had, but there were some other misses that ruined it. Possibly the brightest and nicest looking Italian place I've dined at recently (but when I say bright, think dimmed lighting). However, since everything is made from scratch, and it's Italian food, Aunt Jakes really delivers that lifestyle. For instance, waiting foreverrrrrr for food. Waiting for appetizers. Waiting for entrees. Waiting for desserts. Waiting for check. All that took three hours. YEP WE HAD A THREE HOUR LUNCH. Company lunch tho so it's okCalamari ($27): hands down the WORST calamari I've ever had. So deep fried and rock hard to the point where that crunch isn't even desirable anymore. Actual calamari was tiny and rubbery. Never again Mussels ($29): starting to see that Aunt Jake's only purchases tiny seafood to serve their diners because these mussels? The size of a pistachio nut. Sigh. Didn't really like the sauce, but I can't say no to mussels, even if they're itty bittyTagliatelle in Sunday Sauce ($22): this is an create your own pasta dish. I fell in LOVE with the tagliatelle. Best I've ever had. SO fresh and chewy, I don't think I can ever think of pasta in a different way again (as in my overcooked pasta dinners at home). I probably should've gone with a different sauce since I don't really like marina, but I really wanted a meaty sauce, so I decided to try. It's decent, but they only gave me one piece of sausage. Bummer. Pretty decent portion (I had to take half for home)Tiramisu ($8): sooooo good. It was more of a cake than a tiramisu but it was heavenly! Ultra soft layers and loved the cream!Sundae ($16): one of those ginormous sundaes that you can skip unless you haven't had chocolate ice cream in three years and are going through withdrawal. Otherwise, that sugar OD is notttt worth itAlso, the arrabiata (marinara sauce with chili peppers and roasted garlic) sauce is one of the most interesting and delicious pasta sauces I've ever tried. My friend ordered it with tricolored pasta and the sauce was this spicy tomato-y goodness that really wowed me. Yumm",0
15821,"This ramen restaurant offers a substantial menu, balancing classic flavors with inventive twists. As a vegetarian, I appreciated the variety of options available, from ramen to donburi.

13932,"It was a bit pricey for what it was, not bad but not the best Malaysian/ Southeast Asian food you can find in Chinatown. The restaurant was very cute with a French ambiance, which was probably why it was packed with a lot of tourists. It was a welcoming ideal place for people who are intimidated by the no thrills, hole in the wall Asian restaurants in Chinatown.The restaurant was supposedly French- Malaysian fusion. However, I saw Japanese items (ramen and udon) and Thai items (Tom yum soup) on their menu. I also didn't get much of a French- Malaysian fusion vibe. The majority of the items seemed to be Malaysian with only a sprinkle of French dishes. I guess the wine menu made it more French-Malaysian fusion? We ordered the Rojak (fruit and vegetable salad topped with sweet and savory syrup) to start. My Southeast Asian boyfriend thought it was way too sweet and overwhelming. I had the Johor Laksa and it was interesting. Thick Lo Mein noodles with a curry gravy fish paste, pretty decent. The thing that threw me off was the yellow radish topping( the same type used in Korean gim bap). I found it a bit strange to put in Malaysian food. My bf got the Malacca Laksa, which was a bit disappointing. We could barely taste any coconut milk in the curry broth and it lacked the fishy/ seafood depth to it. It was just noodles with curry. For people who are not familiar with Malaysian/ Singaporean food, Aux Epices is okay. Just don't be afraid to venture into other more authentic restaurants in Chinatown. For the Southeast Asian people, don't even bother here! You're going to be disappointed.",0
3456,"My friends have been saying that this is the place to go to get the Best burger ever. So I had to try it out. I got the double cheeseburger which is really a triple. I asked to have it medium rare but they said that the way they cook their burgers they cook them on the medium side. It was a really great burger. I really enjoyed the pickled topping that they put on. My husband and I got two orders of their fries, and honestly that was probably the best part. The fries are crispy yet soft on the inside with great seasoning. It comes with a garlic aioli which was quite tasty.A bit pricey overall, but I guess its expected in NYC. We made reservations online and we were taken right away when we got there. As a hint, the entrance is on a side alley way- feels like somewhere batman would hide at night.  Cool atmosphere on the inside.",0

19731,"Well, here I am after hearing Cantina has hired a new Executive Chef after I been years ago and I have no words for how the food was. Reservations were simple to make and we were seated instantly despite being a few minutes late. It was PACKED for brunch and I highly suggest locking in a spot prior to coming. It's a beautiful space, it's fully open and they have a retractable roof in case it rains! Music selection is great, mix of new and old school Hip-Hop, today's top hits, house, Spanish songs, it goes on and on. You will not have trouble enjoying yourself. On to the food and drinks tho: I got a Coco Loco Mojito. Only way to describe it is as a minty piña colada and I'm here for it! We started off with an Al Pastor Gringa Quesadilla and I will warn you it's not your typical Quesadilla where everything is sandwiched in the middle. It's on top, and a fork and knife is almost must. The tortilla was fresh, not your regular store bought tortilla. The Al Pastor was juicy, the right amount of pineapple to balance it out in with every bite. It all sat on a layer of cheese and a red sauce I can't put together what it was but it was really really good with a slight kick. For the entree I got the Mexican Double Smash Burger which is a one of a kind burger for sure. 2 Pat La Frieda burgers (NYC classic selection of meat) with cheese , an egg sunny side up, a house sauce on a Concha Bun. The Mexican Concha was super fresh, and that balance of sweet and savory was stellar. My lady got Steak & eggs which she loved, her home fries were extra crispy which at least for us was a lovely touch.  Our only complaint really was that they didn't ask me how I wanted my burger cooked where I thought they would ask, but since they didn't I thought they would be in the Medium-Rare or Medium range and got it well done. When my girlfriend asked for her steak she instantly asked for Medium but instead got Well Done as well. Just something to keep in mind. Other than that, I WILL be coming back for their Big Ass Taco! Give this spot a try if you want a fun and enjoyable brunch on a rooftop!",0

Since I love a little spice, I got the Sichuan Chili Salmon in regular size. It was a decent amount of food, but I was not full after. I would recommend the large size if you are a big eater. The flavor was nice and the fish was decent quality. I wish it had more toppings and veggies.I think the bowls are a tad overpriced.

The service is super quick and the food comes out asap (especially the dumplings-- maybe a 5 minute wait). I would recommend trying both the steamed and the fried dumplings. It's $4 for 8 of them, so why not? I would then recommend mixing their sweet dark sauce (in the Sriracha bottle) with their chili oil in a sauce bowl (you may have to request this). This gives the perfect sauce combination of sweet and spicy for your dumpling needs. I then recommend their beef brisket knife cut fried noodles. There's a page for soup noodles and a page for fried noodles so be sure to know what you're ordering. The knife cut noodles are thicker with random shaped and sized noodles whereas the hand pulled noodles are more precise and the consistency of a thick spaghetti noodle.",0
15996,"Title: Charming Mexican Flair Meets Mixed Reviews at New Eatery

My recent visit to one of the area's newest restaurants, boasting a Mexican flair, presented a blend of highs and lows. Visiting in the off-hours between lunch and dinner limited us to appetizers and drinks, but this gave a good glimpse into their offerings.

The quesadilla, both aesthetically pleasing and palatable, stood out as a highlight of the meal with its excellent taste and presentation. However, the nachos, while visually appealing, were let down by the homemade chips. Although aiming for that authentic corn flavor, they fell short due to being slightly overfried and lacking depth in taste.

Drink-wise, the regular margarita hit the mark but didn't wow. I was underwhelmed by the custom drinks, which at the price point of $11, were unexpectedly diluted with soda, leading to a less than satisfying sip.

The ambience seems to cater to a university crowd with a hipster vibe, indicating a young and energetic clientele. Despite the mixed experience, the restaurant has potential, and I remain open to a return visit, perhaps for dinner, to fully explore what this spot has to offer. Worth a try if you find yourself in the area.",1
16627,"I usually head over to the East Village when I'm looking to try one of the monthly specials at Mimi Cheng's, but we found ourselves near the Nolita location recently and stopped in for the first time. I'm not sure if this location actually has more seating than the other one, but it feels so much more spacious. We got the January special this time, beef chili dumplings that were packed with meat, peppers, onions, tomatoes, and lots of spices, and topped with cheese, sour cream, and cilantro. They were really juicy, a bit spicier than I was expecting, but really satisfying on a cold winter day. Everyone here was really friendly, and it was a comfortable space, so I could definitely see us returning here for future monthly specials.",0
2133,"I recently dined at this unique fusion of a furniture store and restaurant, and the experience was delightful. The atmosphere buzzed with creativity, offering a novel concept that made the meal all the more enjoyable. Our server brought warmth and attentiveness to the table, enhancing the overall dining experience.

The cuisine was nothing short of impressive, albeit with a price tag that leans towards the higher end. However, I must say, it's worth it, especially for their tapas. The Maitake Mushrooms were a standout, their tender texture pairing beautifully with the richness of goat cheese—a must-try for cheese enthusiasts. Equally satisfying was the Arroz con pollo, which delivered a burst of authentic flavors and provided good value for its portion size.

The only slight letdown was the Fish tacos. Although generally decent, they were overshadowed by pickled vegetables that dominated the palate a bit too forcefully for my taste.

In summary, this establishment has easily climbed the ranks to become one of my favorite tapas destinations. Just be strategic with your choices if you're looking for the best experience.",1
17218,"Wow. Absolutely the best omakase I've ever had in the city thus far. My best friend brought me here for my birthday as a surprise as she knows I'm lately been obsessed with / on the hunt for the best omakase in NYC. So far I've been impressed by a lot of places but Sushi by Bou has maintained my #1 spot, given the quality of the sushi every visit and the low price point. The omakase at Sushi ishikawa really blew it out of the water and has officially become my #1.SETTING: Friday night reservation for 8:30pm at one of the three tables adjacent to the omakase bar. It's a relatively small restaurant but a good size, 12ish or so seating sushi bar, dim lighting, clean and classic sushi restaurant. The restaurant was completely full that night and our dinner ran about 3 hours (we ordered a LOT).FOOD: we all got the 16 course for $155 omakase. I think this is a must.I'm posting pictures which speak for themselves. The best part about Sushi Ishikawa is they somehow elevate the taste of the sushi to the next level. It's not just how fresh the sushi itself is but the interesting and unique combinations that really make this omakase a show stopper. We ordered so. much. more. Extras pieces after the 16 course omakase because we could not believe how delicious the sushi was here. One of the courses was uni, salmon roe and truffle on a little chewy honey cracker. Even thinking about it now, my mouth is watering.VERDICT: Singlehandedly, with no question, the best omakase I've had in NYC. This place is a must.",0
13510,"There already was a line at 11:30am - half hour before the opening hour.   I found it odd that they didn't try to fill every table and seat.  Although I can't complain about it either because it was nice not having to be crowded with other customers. My friends and I got a table at the back.  It was spacey and clean.  Alot of the waiters hanged out there until the customers placed their orders.  We were politely pestered to order by multiple waiters multiple times for a good 10 minutes after we sat down.  They should've encouraged customers to think about their orders when they're waiting on line by distributing menus.  There was too much pressure to order asap. My friends and I got four different steam rice rolls - pork liver, fish, shrimp and pork and roast pork.  The rice skin was indeed thin and chewy.  They gave a lot of filling except the shrimp and pork had only three small shrimps.  Their rice rolls weren't the best I ever had but I feel it's above average. We also got a bowl of fried fish skin and a bowl of congee. They tasted pretty standard.  I thought the fried fish skin was pricey for what it was. Additionally, we got the hot and cold HK style milk tea.  Again tasted pretty standard for that style of milk tea.  I had them in HK and other places in the city.  The cold one was a little warm so if you get it, leave it in the ice for a little while before drinking.",0
13475,"Title: A Hidden Gem on Pearl Street

Review:

Navigating to this restaurant was a bit confusing, as its actual location is tucked away on Pearl Street, not Water Street as the address might suggest. A bit more walking than anticipated, but once there, the restaurant's understated front with subtle signage hinted at the casual, laid-back atmosphere awaiting inside.

The interior offers a cozy bar immediately upon entry and a scattering of small café tables accompanied by charmingly mismatched chairs. I even noticed a diner comfortably seated on a pillow-topped dresser, adding a quirky touch to the homey environment.

The menu is an homage to authentic, home-cooked Chinese fare, with most dishes priced at $10 or less—a pleasant surprise for the area. Our table enjoyed a selection of their offerings, including braised pork belly over rice, pan-fried pork dumplings, minced pork tacos, and chive and shrimp golden pockets.

Of all the dishes, the golden pockets truly stood out with their delightfully thin, crunchy, and chewy skin – a delectable contrast to the non-greasy filling. The pork tacos were a flavor revelation, thanks to the tender minced pork, tomatoes, and cilantro. While the braised pork belly was somewhat on the fatty side, the savory brown gravy it was served with made up for it. And the dumplings? They had that unmistakable taste of being freshly handcrafted, featuring juicy meat encased in a perfectly crispy skin.

Service was another highlight - efficient and friendly, complementing the overall dining experience. For those in the South Street Seaport area looking for a quick, tasty, and affordable meal in a relaxed setting, this little restaurant is worth seeking out.",1
2102,"Great food but portions are TINY, sorry just not worth the price, I had a slice of pizza afterwards.Brussels sprouts were great, octopus was average, pasta dishes were good but tiny, drink menu is great. Overall an okay meal if you order enough food but the portions were just a bit too small for me (pastas and apps, not sure about entrees).",0

I always have enough for leftovers the next day. This is now my new go to for when I'm in the mood for some Jamaican food. Check em out!",0
11023,"If there is a listing of unique finds in the plaza food court, this spot would probably top it out. Being a large producer and distributor of Russian products, one of the primary being caviar, this is an establishing brand. Of course it hails from Brooklyn...after all, where would a caviar venture originate from... The caviar tasting is professional and solid, priced essentially at retail prices. Average quality paddlefish caviar, white sturgeon and phenomenal ossetra caviar to finish off. Even champagne is hardly upcharged. $70 for a bottle of Moët. Not sure if it's the Moet that's also made in Brighton Beach, but tasted delicious. One element that was odd was the lack of crystal glasses. Drinking champagne and eating caviar, while sipping from a cheap glass is not very pleasant. The interior is fine, but can't say it's beautiful. In general, I liked the place given its price point. A few things felt out of place (as things often do in Russian establishments), but if seeking caviar, this is a solid spot.",0
19370,"Title: Fresh Flavors at a Crossroad

Review: Opted for 4 stars given the mixed experience at this spot. The quest for ceviche led us here, and we plunged into a large Mixto and a small Classico with flounder. First off, the butter lettuce underlay was a miss – it made for awkward navigation to the marinated morsels. Freshness wasn’t in question; both dishes delivered on aroma and taste, especially the Mixto with its standout dressing. That said, the Mixto could use more octopus to justify its name. The corn, both charred and boiled, added a satisfying crunch. A word to the wise: if you're a squid fan, you'll miss it here. Their absence left a yearning for that quintessential ceviche zest. Final verdict? A hesitant 6.5/10 – I'm open to a return, but with hopes of menu tweaks.",1
20733,"I stumbled into this eatery by chance, mistaking it for its neighbor, and was surprised at the unfamiliar menu. The service shone with efficiency from seating to payment. I chose the hot duck soba; the duck, while tender, was underwhelming in taste, and the broth seemed a simplistic blend of soy sauce and water. The noodles were the dish's saving grace, cooked to perfection. Despite the attentive staff, the meal fell flat, not justifying the $20 cost and leaving me with a sense of disappointment.",1
15146,"Title: Sweet Sips and Savory Bites at Neighborhood Gem

Do yourself a favor and head over to this cozy nook that's churning out some seriously delectable shakes. Their milkshakes aren't just a treat for the taste buds; they're a feast for the eyes – think choco-tacos, Oreo ice cream sandwiches, and generous wedges of cake all piled on top. These shakes are so pretty, you'll struggle with the idea of disturbing their perfection for a sip. But trust me, it's worth it.

If you're coming in hungry, split one of their decent burgers with a friend. It's a solid choice, and you'll want to save room for the star shakes. Also, don't overlook the fried mozzarella appetizers or their variety of wings – both are tasty options that'll round out your meal nicely.

The place is snug, with an intimate basement room complemented by a small dining space upstairs, giving it a quaint, homely vibe. The servers here are the cherry on top – very nice, and they keep things moving along swiftly.

Overall, this spot is a great choice for a casual hangout with friends where you can indulge in some Instagram-worthy delights that taste as good as they look.",1
11985,"At first, I thought it was just japanese curry, will it be better than box mix? So I decided to give this place a try, omg it was amazing! Definitely coming back for more! The price was reasonable and food was just amazing! However I took one star off because the service was just okay. The server wasn't very attentive to seat me and after I finished my food, the server wasn't fast enough to provide service. Also, the server wrote ""cash pls"" on the receipt and that was really confusing, I know it indicate that paying cash is preferred and not mandatory, but ""cash pls"" really make me thought that it's a cash only place. I will certainly come back again for the food, just hope that server is more attentive and enthusiastic at this place.",0
18657,"Title: Affordable Gem for Lunch in Murray Hill

I've recently discovered a fantastic spot for lunch specials in Murray Hill that's become a quick favorite of mine. Not only is it conveniently located close to my job, but their $10 lunch special is unbeatable in the area. The food they serve is delicious and consistently satisfies my midday cravings without fail. While some places might compromise on service or ambiance with lower prices, this restaurant maintains a pleasantly average service paired with a low-key atmosphere which I thoroughly appreciate. Having visited twice in the last two weeks, it's safe to say their lunch deal is a standout and I'm already planning my next visit.",1
19484,"FINALLY! Been wanting to try the pizza here for yeeaaars but after being told the wait would be 2 hours one night, I was always afraid to come back and even try. Who would've thought that a Friday evening during the San Gennaro Feast would be a good time to come? I expected the opposite (the worst)!While I was still stuck at the office, my boyfriend dropped by at around 5:50pm to put his name down. He was told that it'd be approx an hour wait - not bad at all, especially since I still needed to commute down from midtown. After only about 40 min, the table was ready at around 6:30pm -- amazing! I actually had to run/rush down there since they only hold the table for like 10 min and the narrow street was packed due to the festival... thankfully after dodging through all that, we were calmly escorted to our high top table inside. (Eating outside where the festival was would've been ideal but I didn't mind)Our waiter was very friendly and gave great suggestions. I was so excited to finally try the famous Tie-Dye pizza and it truly lived up to the hype! The vodka sauce was sooo good and comforting and I loved the thin crust. Didn't love the edge of the crust as it was too hard/crispy but everything else was perfect. We actually got a small pie, half Tie-Dye and the other half Rubirosa Supreme, which includes pepperoni and chopped up mini meatballs. This was also delicious and not overly salty, as it easily could've been. The flavors of both pizzas were on. point.There was complimentary bread/oil at the beginning but we just split one piece since we wanted to save our stomachs. We ordered a side of Lena's Green Bean Salad (I generally love green beans and wanted a refreshing side of veggies to compliment the pizza) which was also very good. I liked that it was dressed w/ vinegar and chilled - definitely hit the spot. I didn't mind that there were potatoes in the salad, but I wished there were more green beans and less potatoes lol... carb overload!Surprisingly, at least half of the bar seats were empty throughout our whole meal, as well as a table for 4 right by us. It wasn't packed or overly loud - the perfect ambiance. Not sure if we just got lucky that night, or it's really not as hectic than I imagined. Hope it won't take me forever and a half to return!",0
13470,"I recently had the pleasure of dining at a local ramen spot that truly stood out from the crowd. As a New Yorker with a taste for noodles, I can confidently say that this restaurant offers the best ramen I've encountered in the city. The flavors were exceptional, and the broth was nothing short of amazing—rich and deeply satisfying.

The wait staff added to the experience with their super friendly demeanor, ensuring a welcoming environment that matched the quality of the meal. Despite its popularity and cozy space, which might require a brief wait, the affordability of the dishes was a delightful surprise. This establishment provides top-notch ramen at prices that are much more reasonable compared to other options in NYC. If you're a ramen enthusiast, this spot is a must-visit!",1

A personal standout is the potato rosemary pizza, which is simply divine. If you're looking to savor a slice of Rome, this place is a must-visit. Enjoy!",1
13352,"Booked this spot way in advance for brunch. Came here with some friends and went to town on a bunch of meats. We had the beef carpaccio, ground beef rolled in betel leaf, roasted berkshire pork meatball, seared scallops and the lemongrass steak & eggs. This was plenty of food for 4 people. The carpaccio is a must order if you love strong citrus flavors. The beef was prepared perfectly and the extra fried onions added some great texture. The ground beef and berkshire pork meatballs tasted just like how I have them at family parties. The steak and eggs were perfect. The Maggi soy sauce, bone marrow butter and the added lemon grass made this dish delicious. Each bite was savory and the combination of French baguette with egg made this so good. Highly recommend making reservations way in advance. This place was pretty empty for brunch. My family and I really enjoyed our experience here. Our servers were very knowledgeable of the menu and flavors. I'll definitely be back to sample their beef 7 ways platter.",0
17683,"Title: Disappointing Birthday Dinner Experience at Dyckman Street Eatery

My recent visit to a restaurant on Dyckman Street in Washington Heights/Inwood for a co-worker's birthday celebration was underwhelming, to say the least. The evening's bill came to a total of $62.93, which, given the experience, felt steep.

To start, the complimentary tortilla chips and salsa were the highlight, allowing us to munch away until our main courses arrived. We noticed hookahs were on offer, although we didn't partake.

Our primary challenge was communication with the staff, who struggled significantly with English. This led to a series of misunderstandings—from our request to change tables due to a chilly draft, to our dietary preferences for the guacamole and vegetables, as well as simply ordering drinks. Our requests were met with confusion, and at times, it seemed as if the waitstaff preferred to avoid us rather than attempt to resolve our issues.

The entree, an Alaskan King Salmon with a medley of sautéed vegetables priced at $25, was fresh but fell short in terms of vegetable selection and flavoring; the abundance of zucchini and yellow squash did not appeal to my tastes. The guacamole at $12 was freshly prepared but unexpectedly salty, and the salsa outshone it by far.

The Shirley Temple drink was overly ginger-ale-centric with a noticeable absence of grenadine, and disappointingly, no maraschino cherry.

A side note: This establishment only accepts chipped credit/debit cards or cash. Although they offer a Yelp mobile check-in promo, this little consolation doesn't compensate for the odd bathroom setup, where the women's single stall leads to long lines, highlighting a design oversight without regard for practicality.

In summary, the culinary experience and service at this Dyckman Street establishment were deficient. I won't be returning or recommending it.",1
10090,"Tucked into a cozy space, this restaurant may not be expansive, but it comfortably accommodates several groups at a time. The menu offers a satisfying variety of pizzas with size options that cater to any appetite. Prices are fair, considering the freshness of the ingredients. The pizza stands out with its authentically thin crust, allowing the rich flavors of the toppings and sauce to truly shine. While the crust is on the thinner side, a medium pizza is likely enough to satiate a hungry individual. Overall, a delightful spot for an enjoyable pizza experience.",1
19681,"The Boil has been on my radar for quite some time, but the opportunity never really presented itself to go. Well to day was the day. It was my friend's birthday and she wanted seafood so The Boil came up as an option. After she viewed the pictures we were decided.Arriving soon after opening for the day, (around 3:00pm) The staff was all there, masks and gloves on, ready to help with a smile. As a first time visitor, very welcoming. They gave us time and space to desire what it was we needed to purchase and so got order. When we were overwhelmed with all the delicious choices she suggested we select The Boil special flavor (all the other flavors together) for our combo. Good choice! We went with the Queen combo (snow crab and crawfish) and subbed out the crawfish for shrimp (heads off). We were both in dire need of those bering sea crustaceans, so we added snow crab as a main.  My friend also purchased some catfish and wings to take home for later. In retrospect, I should have too. The servings are appropriate for the price. It's more like a lunch size portion meal (includes fries), as opposed to an appetizer. Definitely enough for a meal.  I will definitely pick up something from that section next time. Personally I wanted to take part of the bogo to go happy hour, but as I was about to pay with my card, I was informed that they only took cash. There is a ATM on site, but we had to wait anyway so I walk to a bank nearby to avoid any fees. The food was ready in roughly 20 minutes and they were super nice by giving us utensils bibs gloves Exeter a so we could enjoy our food in a nearby park. Tempted by happy hour, I ended up purchasing the Saint mojito and 2 flavors of lemonade. All I can say super delicious and tasty (Im typing this review with a sufficient buzz from the Saint Mojito). The flavor of the sauce and the freshness of our food in those steam bags blew us both away! The crispy, savory, and slightly spicy fries were a great addition to the order, make sure to use the sauce. It would really rock on a po-boy.  They were so nice throughoutthe entire visit, even told my friend happy birthday a few times. We will definitely be back.",0
14211,"Title: A Bite of Italy at The Panini Spot

My latest visit to The Panini Spot reaffirmed why this place is a lunchtime staple. They've upped their game by adding office catering to their repertoire, offering a variety of delightful, reasonably priced options that easily beat the mundane sandwich routine. Their warm paninis, conveniently sliced for sharing, are a testament to their commitment to flavor and quality.

Upon attending a private tasting event on 1/9/19, I was impressed with the spread, which included their exemplary paninis and two signature salads that were nothing short of culinary artistry. The tough choice between the spicy salami Panini (#23) with their irresistible house-made pesto and the classic prosciutto Crudo Panini (#21) confirms the excellence of their ingredients.

At the catering showcase, the antipasto skewers were a visual and gastronomic delight, perfectly paired with a thoughtful selection of wine and water options. And let's not forget the breakfast offerings that include tantalizing options like a Nutella, mascarpone, and banana panini.

It's worth mentioning that their secret sauces and dressings, made in-house, might just be available for purchase if you're in the know. And with the choice between Florentine white or seven-grain bread for your panini, customization is welcomed.

In summary, The Panini Spot remains a top choice for an authentic taste of Italy. Whether catering to an office gathering or simply grabbing a bite, this eatery promises satisfaction with every flavorful selection.",1
21133,"I would definitely come back here if I visited NY again.  Came here because of a friends recommendation and definitely don't regret it. I tried the Pit stop meal where you get the biscuit and your choice of meat and sides. So I went with something that I knew would be fulfilling but I wasn't going to waste. That was the sausage with a side of cornbread and of course the biscuit. Even with the cornbread I still shared it because it was pretty big! We got the wings to share and although it was messy, it was pretty good. I'm on a diet, so I knew if I ate too much wings I wasn't going to be able to eat my main meal. Although it doesn't look like much, tbh, it was a lot for me and the perfect serving size. I was really satisfied with my dish and happy with what I got. Especially being a tourist where you don't want to bring home food/ waste anything. It definitely was the right choice. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a place worth going $$$ and a sit down meal where you can talk and have intimate discussions Customer service was great! The only thing is the bathrooms are weird. You couldn't really tell if they where vacant or not because it doesn't say if it's vacant like how it usually does on the door and you don't want to be weird and push the door open.

For a mere $10, I indulged in a small yet tasty Thai salad, a satisfyingly regular-sized green curry brimming with fresh veggies, and perfectly steamed rice. The flavors were fresh and delectable.

15873,"I want to give 3.5 stars. This is one of the newer and hipper restaurants in Chinatown. The interior is nicely decorated, clean, and perfect for a work lunch or a meet up. Not very packed on a weekday afternoon. For drink, I ordered the mint ice Vietnamese coffee. It was standard Cafe Du Monde coffee with a slight mint flavor. It was not bad but not worth $5. I tried the classic beef pho with the ""crazy rich broth"", which they claimed to have cooked for at least 25 hours. The pho broth was clean and good but not ""crazy rich"". I could not tell the difference between this broth and other ""regular"" broths at other restaurants. I was expecting something special and beyond average but the broth was lacking depth in terms of ""richness"". Also, the portion size was way too small. I have a small appetite but I still felt hungry after eating. The regular broth was around $10 and $5 extra for the crazy rich broth. The rice noodles were a perfect bounce and not too soggy but this bowl of pho did not justify the $15 price point. The flavor of pho broth, noodle texture, and small portion size seemed quite similar to another NYC pho restaurant. Upon doing further research, I found that the owners of Pho Bar are associated with Saigon Shack in Greenwich Village. No wonder the ""crazy rich broth"" tasted familiar! Pho Bar is just a more dressed up version of Saigon Shack. It's the same pho but just branded fancier under hip florescent lights and cool wall paper. I guess you're paying more for the hip ambiance and the better service. The pho is good but not extraordinary. Maybe I will give it another chance and try something else on their menu.",0

On a practical note, seating is streamlined: snag a table after placing your order at the counter. During my last visit, I indulged in the breakfast bowl, which was a satisfying choice. This round, my taste buds danced to the tune of their seared tuna salad – a flavorful dish, though a tad heavy on rice compared to greens.

The service was a bit off and there was some mix up over the bill and I am still not even sure what happened! The waiter came to our table and said there was a mix up over the bill and then gave our credit card back without an explanation.The main reason I am upset is that we had asked for our food to be boxed up to go (mind you we still had a lot of food left) and when we got home we learned that the food that was boxed up was not even our food!

Nish Nush is a true treasure in the hustle and bustle of FiDi, rivaling even the beloved Sakura for the title of best lunch spot in the area. Nish Nush stands out dramatically due to its inclusive menu that caters to a plethora of dietary preferences, from vegan and kosher to vegetarian and potentially gluten-free.

The cuisine here is simply exceptional. On a recent visit, I utilized the Ritual app to snag a little discount, but even without the price cut, the value is evident. Prices are fair, especially considering the generous portions. My pita stuffed with five or six succulent falafels, accompanied by an ample serving of hummus, tahina, pickles, olives, and a crisp Israeli salad, was truly a feast.

Every component was bursting with flavor, from the perfectly moist falafels to the medley of fresh condiments. Nish Nush has mastered the art of satisfying hunger with gusto.

10590,"Came for dinner on a Wednesday around 8pm and there was a ~45 minute wait to be seated for 3.JeJu Noodle Bar is a Korean restaurant with 1 Michelin Star in West Village, Manhattan. They serve their 6 Course Prix Fixe family-style for $55pp, so my table of 3 shared everything. Very lax environment and the interior design was beautiful. Overall 5/5, would come back for sure.Course 1: 5/5, JEJU Chicken WingsFried chicken w crudités (eg raw vegetables, including radish, cabbage, cucumbers) and a house dipping that tasted like an upgraded version of spicy mayo. Each person got two wings, which was a perfect amount to start off the dinner. The raw veggies complemented the heavier poultry well, and made the dish more lively in color. The chicken felt ""cleaner"" and lightly fried, as nothing was overly breaded and I saw no signs of hanging greaseCourse 2: Roasted Mushroom with LOADS OF TRUFFLE THAT CAME FROM A TREASURE CHEST!! So cool!! 5/5!!! The server brought over a flashy chest containing several truffles, then proceeded to shave a truffle in front of us. The truffles weren't that much of a value add on the dish tbh. However, high rating for the AMAZINGLY prepared mushrooms. Usually I have an issue with mushrooms, because chefs love dousing them in soy sauce. But, this had a perfect balance of herbs and soy that the mushrooms tasted fresh. Each person got 2-3 mushrooms slices.Course 3: Toro Ssam Bap: fatty tuna, scrambled egg, tobiko rice in one dish, with toasted seaweed on the side. Meant to make your own mini seaweed toro taco. 5/5. This was one of my favorite dishes, and it was more than enough for three people. I didn't really notice the egg in the dish, but the rice and fatty tuna were both well prepared and portioned for the amount of seaweed provided.Course 4: Prime Ribeye Ssam, 5/5. Comes with white kimchi, romesco tomato sauce, and a variety of leaves (lettuce, perilla, cabbage) to wrap the sliced beef around. By default, they cooked this medium rare, and cut each piece to about 1/2 inch thickness and 1/4 inch x 1 inch. Combined with the sauce, kimchi, and leaf wrap, the ssam was so good and nothing overpowered the juiciness of the ribeye.Course 5: 2 bowls of Ramyun to share. 4/5. For the prix fixe menu, it's one bowl per two people. But since there were three of us, we got two bowls, which means we got 1/2 bowl extra ;) ;) ;) We chose the wagyu Ramyun which was an extra $23 (total, not pp) and the Gochu Ramyun (spicy pork). The Wagyu Ramyun came with thin raw wagyu slices that we stirred into the noodles to cook. The broth for the Gochu bowl was heavier and creamier; it reminded me of a Paitan ramen broth. The noodles for a little thin imo, but the wagyu was unbeatable. Broth here was more transparent and spicy. The pork was okay, though some parts of it were dry and I didn't really care for it. Course 6 (dessert!): Raspberry sorbet topped w mint and thin slices of green apple. 5/5. After eating the heavier courses 4 and 5, this was a nice clean end to a big dinner. Woo! Great meal and would recommend to all! Thanks Jeju!",0

Thai Son has earned its place as my go-to comfort spot. Highly recommended for anyone craving a reliable and satisfying pho experience.",1
14471,"Title: A Return to Upland: Still a Culinary Delight

My latest visit to Upland solidified its place as a favorite. Note that reservations are a must for table dining, but bar seats are a bit easier to snag, especially for pairs, which I find equally enjoyable.

The menu is impeccable. I started with the Beef Tartare, elegantly paired with black trumpet mushrooms, puffed farro, anchovy, and a rich egg yolk. The Pappardelle followed, with a spicy sausage ragù and kale, topped with a generous dusting of parmigiano – every bite was a perfect melody of flavors.

The standout dish, however, was the Montauk Fluke Ceviche. The smoked avocado, spicy cabbage, and sunflower seeds created a wonderfully citrusy and refreshing ensemble—absolutely a must-try.

In short, Upland never disappoints, serving up dish after dish of culinary excellence. I'll be back for thirds.",1
2295,"Glad I got to try this place and overall a solid omakase experience. Came for dinner at 9:45PM on a Friday night. The restaurant is small with a 10ish-seat sushi bar, three omakase chefs and a small alcove space with a table for around 4.SUSHI: we went a little crazy and all ordered the $180, 20+ piece omakase. The meal started with a bowl of sashimi (three small pieces of 3 types of tuna), and some other small sushi/sashimi appetizers that I can't recall. Overall was pretty good but acted mostly as fillers until the actual omakase/nothing was mindblowing. The meal really began once the omakase started. Even though we all came hungry, the 20+ option ended up being a bit too much. I would recommend the step below so you're not excessively full at the end/can appreciate each piece.The sushi pieces were relatively big cuts of fish. As always, the standouts for me were the fatty tuna (the fatty tuna here was probably the best I've ever had), medium fatty tuna, two different types of uni (Maine and Tokyo) and seared eel piece (again, probably the best eel piece I've ever had). They also served some unique pieces like clam, octopus and smoked crab. Can't say I loved those. VERDICT: The truth is, though the quality of the fish and the meal were excellent, in terms of best omakase for best value, this place can't beat Sushi by Bou. It's definitely worth visiting if you're in the mood for spending some $$$ on omakase and a pleasant / filling omakase experiences, but if you're looking for value and same level of fresh quality sushi, I think you can get as great sushi (though smaller cuts of fish) at Sushi by Bou.",0
14189,"Came here during my lunch break. I couldn't decide between getting the Chengdu dan dan noodles or the sesame sauce cold mix so I did what a normal foodie would do and got both lol. I liked the sesame sauce cold mix more because the cucumbers make the dish less heavy. The dan dan noodles, while more flavorful, were very greasy and I ended up feeling slightly nauseous after finishing it. The noodles in both dishes were excellent. I ordered mild spiciness for both and it ended up being the perfect amount of heat. Prices are very good given the neighborhood that the restaurant is located in. Would definitely come back!",0
18152,"Title: A Delightful Italian Lunch in FiDi

I recently enjoyed a wonderful dining experience at a bustling Italian restaurant in the Financial District. My colleagues and I arrived at noon and were promptly seated, but it's worth noting that reservations are advisable – the place was packed by 12:30 pm.

The menu features an array of enticing specials. Standout dishes included the Eggplant Rollatini, which was generously stuffed with mozzarella and perfectly complemented by a rich marinara sauce. The Grilled Octopus was a unique and delicious take compared to other establishments, seasoned to perfection and ideal for sharing. Although the Grilled Hanger Steak was slightly rarer than my preference, the flavors were robust, enhanced by wild mushroom fregula and a zesty porcini vinaigrette.

This restaurant is a must-visit for anyone craving authentic Italian fare with a twist. Whether you're coming in with coworkers for lunch or looking for a satisfying dinner spot, the quality and variety of dishes here won't disappoint.",1
1462,"Visited a quaint little restaurant on Saturday and faced a fairly lengthy 30-minute wait for a table for two. Opting for seats at the sushi bar, we decided on the sushi for two - a choice that was kind on the wallet. While the fish served was fresh and enjoyable, it didn't quite hit the heights of culinary excellence. All in all, a decent dining experience, albeit not an extraordinary one.",1
2288,"Title: Casual Dining Delight

My recent Friday night dinner at this local eatery was a thoroughly enjoyable experience. The restaurant, while bustling, had enough room to comfortably accommodate my party without a wait. With a substantial menu teeming with diverse options, it was easy for everyone to find something to tantalize their taste buds. 

The service stood out as particularly commendable; our server was both attentive and amiable, making our dining experience that much more pleasant. I was also impressed by the cleanliness of the facilities, including a spotless bathroom.

A notable highlight was the inclusion of vegan and vegetarian dishes, catering to a variety of dietary needs. While the ambiance was slightly noisy, it did not detract significantly from the relaxing atmosphere. 

The outdoor seating area was another pleasant surprise, offering a spacious and well-organized option for al fresco dining. It's certainly a spot worth considering for anyone looking to unwind with a drink or a satisfying meal in a friendly setting.",1

11410,"I popped into the restaurant for a quick bite before heading to the airport, hoping to grab a couple of satisfactory slices. Service was efficient and welcoming, which was a relief given my tight schedule. However, the pizza itself was a bit of a letdown. I opted for the grandma Sicilian slice, which boasted a flavorful sauce but unfortunately was the only highlight. The crust was disappointingly gummy and slightly burnt, detracting from the overall taste, while the cheese was forgettable, merely occupying space on the slice without adding any real depth of flavor. Glancing at the other pizzas on offer, I couldn't help but feel I might have missed out on what could have been a more enjoyable meal had I chosen differently.",1
12417,"This place is so beautiful! I recommend going here for any special event. Be aware it is hard to get reservations if you don't plan ahead! I called them a few days ahead but we couldn't get any since we were a party of 9. So we decided to go with it and get to the restaurant early and hope to get seated. It was risky but worth it. In the end, we were able to get seated once our entire group arrived. Service was really fast and we were just in awe of the beauty and decor around us. I felt like we were dining in luxury. Lol As for the food, I got red curry with chicken. I thought the portion was decent for the amount I paid. While my red curry was very tasty and creamy, I kept comparing it to my favorite red curry. In my opinion, while this shop had tasty curry it's not my favorite. We also got drinks and oh my... these were very strong. I swear mine was just all alcohol but I'm sure others would've loved it. It was just too strong for me. I would go again if I'm in town! Such a gorgeous restaurant!",0
20568,"Visited at 6:30 PM on a Thursday, missed the happy hour window (4-6 PM) but still ventured into drinks. I went with ""Send Roses,"" and my friend chose ""Puddle Jumper,"" each priced at $16. We added spiced fries for $8 to our order. Service was prompt and attentive, likely aided by the quiet evening crowd.

The drinks were decent; though I had requested something with a strong lemon presence, the flavors in ""Send Roses"" were rather muted. Not particularly memorable. However, the spiced fries stole the show—thin, crispy, well-seasoned, and accompanied by a delightful homemade-style dipping sauce. A definite hit.

While the drinks alone wouldn't draw me back, the fries hint at a promising menu. Worth returning to explore further.",1
14434,"We were walking around last night looking for a place for a quick bite before heading home. Bazaar popped up on Yelp so we decided to give it a shot. And I have to say, the decor was lovely. The food was just eh. First Jeffrey ordered oysters. I have to say that given the price of the oysters you would think they would be pretty damn good. Let's just say that I decided not to have any by the look of them. They looked off to me. Jeffrey said that he had to keep spitting out pieces of the shell as they were not shucked properly. And to top that off they weren't even released from the shell. Quite disappointed.  Jeffrey didn't even finish them and that's rare. I got the special: filet mignon with fingerling potatoes and asparagus. I substituted a salad instead of the potatoes. It had a bordelaise sauce. The filet was decent. It wasn't cooked at a medium rare that I ordered. The sauce was ok. Nothing spectacular.  He ordered the octopus. It was just eh. I had high hopes for this restaurant as it looks very nice and swanky. The food was subpar and the service was the same.",0
20642,"Title: Tasty Tacos and Terrific Service on Taco Tuesday

I swung by this lively spot for their famed Taco Tuesday and wasn't disappointed. The tacos may be on the smaller side, priced at an affordable $2.50 each, but they pack a flavorful punch that more than compensates for their size. The drink selection complemented the meal, with potent and well-priced options including $6 well drinks and $7 margaritas.

Service was a highlight, with our server's ever-present smile and quick tips on navigating the happy hour offerings. She made sure we capitalized on the drinks before the 8 pm cutoff, but reassuringly noted that tacos were available all night long—a strategy we appreciated.

The atmosphere is energetic and convivial, a notch above conversational volume yet not overwhelming, and sports enthusiasts will be pleased with the ample TVs. A peek into the back revealed a more relaxed lounge area that warrants further exploration.

In conclusion, the combo of great deals, strong drinks, and excellent service makes for an irresistible Taco Tuesday destination. I'm already planning my next visit.",1
12874,"Title: Cozy Seating and Decent Ramen, But at a Price

I recently ventured to a new ramen spot for the first time and was intrigued by the novel concept of individual cubby seating. My friends and I arrived around 2pm on a Sunday and only had a brief 10-minute wait before we were cozily seated in adjacent cubbies with foldable dividers—ideal for privacy or socializing.

Ordering was a breeze with a simple checklist, though the lack of soup base variety meant we were all in for the same foundational taste. Thankfully, the soup was satisfying in flavor. We took advantage of a promotion offering an extra plate of noodles for free, which was a nice touch. However, the chashu lacked depth and punch, and we were advised to skip the hard-boiled egg as it required self-peeling and didn't justify the effort.

Service was prompt and efficient, a highlight of our visit. While gratuity isn't expected, the higher ramen prices seem to reflect service costs, pushing my meal to $24. The experience was pleasant overall, though the ramen didn't quite top my list of favorites.",1
20334,"Title: A Mixed Bag at Sup Crab - Where Seafood Meets Asian Flair

When my friend and I walked into Sup Crab for an early Friday evening reservation, our excitement for a crab feast was palpable. We were fans of seafood boils and had high hopes for this new establishment. Greeted by an almost empty space that left us questioning the restaurant's popularity, we were nonetheless seated promptly and given seasoned nuts to nibble on as we perused the menu.

The waiter efficiently walked us through our options, pointing out that the coveted salted egg yolk crab was a no-go for crab legs—it was whole crab or nothing. We decided on a medley: crab legs in a 13 herbal spices sauce, sautéed string beans with minced pork, and crawfish noodles for me; my companion opted for a mix of crab legs, crawfish, corn, and sausage tossed in the house sauce.

The 13 herbal spices on my crab legs were a culinary delight—finger-licking good and the highlight of the meal. The string beans hit just the right note of garlicky crunch, reminiscent of the Szechuan dishes I adore. However, the crawfish noodles fell flat, lacking the punch of flavor I anticipated.

My friend's experience with the house sauce was underwhelming, to say the least; it was bland and no amount of bag shaking could summon the desired taste. A supplemental order of the 13 herbal spices sauce (albeit at an extra cost) salvaged her meal.

While the food was overall good, it didn't blow us out of the water. Sup Crab's niche intersection of seafood boil and Asian cuisine means that you really have to crave this specific fusion to make a return visit worthwhile. With other venues like Hot & Juicy and The Boil serving up hearty seafood boils, and a plethora of Szechuan options in Chinatown offering bolder flavors at better value, Sup Crab is more of a 'nice-to-try-once' spot rather than a staple destination.

A special note: the sauce selections are strangely limited by the cooking method—like requiring pan-frying for certain flavors, which doesn't necessarily suit all seafood. Expanding sauce availability could elevate the experience.

In conclusion, if you find yourself hankering for a seafood boil with an Asian twist, Sup Crab might just satisfy that craving. Just manage your expectations, and be ready for a hit-or-miss experience.",1

I recently savored a weekend lunch at a Michelin Star-rated gem in Tribeca, and it left me yearning for a dinner encore. The ""Hen of the Woods"" mushroom banh mi was a revelation – a stellar vegetarian delight. The mushrooms were exceptional, paired with a mysteriously delicious sauce and presented on perfectly crispy buns - an appetizer generously portioned for sharing.

But it was the pho that stole my heart. The broth was a masterpiece of flavor, harmonizing exquisitely with the tender oxtail and brisket. Although extra sauces were offered, the soup's rich taste stood proudly on its own. Not to be outdone, my boyfriend enjoyed the skirt steak market bowl, where the fusion of succulent steak and sticky rice did not disappoint.

This spot has quickly become a favorite in Tribeca, and the thought of their dinner offerings has me eagerly planning my next visit.",1
10184,"We came here on a weekday and were able to get seated. I highly recommend you get there with your guests as they will not seat you until the party is all there. While the vegetarian options were minimal, the mango avocado salad was good as well as the Khao Soi. It reminded me of my trip in Chiangmai where I first had a vegetarian version of it. They forgot my jasmine rice but overall service was ok. I did felt rushed towards the end. We also got both desserts on the menu. The portions are great and it's a cute little Thai place.",0
20527,"This place is truly a 10/10 !! I went here this past weekend for my friends birthday brunch and I was blown away ! The building is small but it can hold a good amount of people at a time. We had a table of 13 and were sat in 10 mins with a reservation. The prix fixe menu was $26 a person (starter and sides to share + one entree) and  $22 more to add bottomless mimosas, sparkling wine or bellinis which is a great brunch deal anywhere, especially New York.The food was absolutely amazing and was served so quickly. My favorite part of the meal was the Mac and cheese side, it was absolutely delicious. The waiters were very efficient and made sure we had everything we needed.

12673,"Title: A Dive into Barn Joo's Offerings Minus the Elusive Happy Hour Oysters

Last Friday, my friends and I landed at Barn Joo, enticed by the promise of $1 happy hour oysters. A heads-up for those planning a visit: the oyster deal is a bar-exclusive, a detail differing from their K-town location, which was a minor letdown. With the bar area swarming with patrons, we conceded our oyster dreams and settled down at our reserved table after a round of drinks.

Opting out of the BBQ, we navigated through the menu, sharing several plates. The Tuna Mayo Tartare was a delightful twist on the classic, albeit a tad heavy on the mayonnaise. The Korean Pancake with Scallion was your standard fare – competent yet unremarkable.

The Uni Bibim Paella stood out as the evening's culinary gem; it's a harmony of textures with a delightful crunch of crisp rice and a bold medley of flavors. The Braised Octopus was tender to perfection and the Seared Scallops were seared to just a hair shy of ideal, the accompanying fresh corn salad deserving its own round of applause.

The Galbi Steak, dubbed NY Bites, featured succulent short rib, but it was the butter sautéed mushrooms that truly captured our palates. Even for four, it was a sizable feast, and though we left satisfied, the pang of missing out on the oyster deal lingered.

Barn Joo's offerings were certainly worth the venture, but here's hoping for better luck at the bar for those who come seeking the same briny bounty we did.",1

11469,"I was apprehensive of giving this place a try, thinking that it was just overpriced fast-food. I was not up to pay $15 for a greasy burger [without a side, for that matter], but my take-out experience in the time of covid--19 pandemic exceeded expectations.Dropped by at 2pm on a Saturday. Several people were ordering pick up, so that was a good sign about the quality of food. Two bum looking men of an indeterminable, middle-to-old age were sitting on two stools inside the ordering area, just chilling [maybe waiting for their order?]. The sign outside said, please no more than 3 people inside at all times. Well, those two inconsiderate 'citizens' were already taking up majority of the tiny space [being 2/3 people], so other customers had to wait outside to place their order. I wanted to ask if those two knew how to read or had any consideration for others, but decided against engaging in conversation with suspicious looking characters.We got bronte $14 and whaleys $15 burgers with + $3 side of sweet fries. Our order was ready in ten minutes! The place looked super casual, the waiter taking our order was accommodating. Wish we could experience our meal sitting down inside, like in the good old days, before social distancing.We ate our meal on the benches of the public square next to the restaurant. I was suspicious of burgers that were served on country bread instead of buns, but the bread was fresh and to my liking, with a crunchy exterior. Whaleys burger [with a fried egg,  beet, and pineapple was a bit too dry and heavy for my liking. My bf said the egg was too much [and he loves eggs and hearty meals]. My bronte burger was just right for me--satisfying without being too heavy. Sweet chilly sauce and mayo were a good combo, giving the burger an unusual twist, which we appreciated. The beef patty of both burgers was juicy and well prepared. Not oily or fatty. Good quality meat. Sweet fries [served with a side of sour cream] were superb--not oily, well-seasoned, perfectly crunchy, surprisingly light, and plentiful.Vine and alcohol is available for take-out as well.Would be happy to return to try more items on the menu.",0

20377,"Title: A Unique Twist on Classic Steak at a Premium

My dining experience at this steak spot was surprisingly delightful thanks to their unconventional wasabi and puréed garlic steak combination. This flavorful profile, enhanced with their Ikinari sauce, makes for a fantastic culinary adventure. I sampled both the strip and ribeye on separate occasions, each served on sizzling onions and corn, allowing for a hearty, personalized portion.

While the preparation is modest, the steak's execution is noteworthy. However, I would discourage splurging on the wagyu. Its subtle taste difference doesn't justify the steep price. Also, be vigilant when your meat is weighed; a non-uniform cut could lead to an unexpected surge in your bill.

Pricing, hovering around $40 per pound for the ribeye, isn't modest, especially considering the beef isn't USDA prime – think quality akin to your local grocery rather than a top-notch NYC steakhouse. Overall, the food is quite good, but it's the unique sauce pairings that steal the show. Just be cautious of the potential costs due to the by-the-ounce ordering system.",1
11532,"Upon entering the restaurant, I was immediately struck by the cool vibe, with its dark, ambient setting and invigorating DJ music playing in the background. Despite its smaller size, the establishment made a strong positive impression with an impressive selection of steaks on display behind glass, enticing eager patrons.

Service was commendable, though at times it felt slightly overzealous, with a noticeable push for up-sales. Nevertheless, the cheeseburger served was a delight—thick, cooked to a perfect medium rare, and exuding juiciness with every bite. It's a solid 4 out of 5 on my scale.

I also splurged on the Ottoman steak, which at $200 is certainly a luxury. It's a generous portion, adequate for 2-3 people, and while I found it quite satisfying—juicy, buttery, and well-seasoned—a hint of char was noticeable. Yet, its flavors packed a punch, earning another 4 out of 5 from me.

The restaurant, a brainchild of the famed Salt Bae, offers a unique dining experience that I believe everyone should try at least once. It's a YOLO kind of place—memorable for both its ambiance and its cuisine.",1

They also have a mermaid sculpture like artwork on the wall which looked amazing. As it is a fish market majority of the items on the menu seafood dishes however as a vegetarian I was very pleased to see at least 4-5 items I could order. I ordered the burrata to start with and chef's vegetarian special for my main. The burrata was amazing absolutely loved it and would recommend it. The main however was a bit too oily for me but still tasty. They also offer pitchers of draft wine which was great to share, the Rose was good. The service was great as well.

19009,"Last night's spur-of-the-moment dining experience at this French tapas haven was a story of culinary highs and modest lows, framed by the establishment's fancy allure. Lucky to secure a 7:30pm slot on a bustling Saturday evening, the menu tantalized with its array of choices. Though appetite was limited post late-lunch, the selection of three tapas—whole artichoke with mixed vegetables, duck confit parmentier, and foie gras lollipops—seemed a perfect fit.

The foie gras lollipops were the star of the show, eliciting a unanimous ""wow"" for their warm, flavor-packed indulgence. Disappointingly, the artichoke, while unique in presentation, partnered with lackluster vegetables, and the duck confit parmentier, though visually appealing, fell short on taste, its dryness shadowing the dish.

The cocktail list shined, notably the mezcal-based L'Antonieta, brimming with a backstory as intriguing as its blend of flavors. A must-try for sour drink aficionados.

Final verdict? Taste earns a solid 4, atmosphere a perfect 5, presentation a near-impeccable 4.5, and service a commendable 4.5. Overall, a venue that warrants a 4 to 4.5 rating, with promises of a return to further explore its culinary narrative.",1
20849,"Title: Mixed Experiences at a Premium Times Square Chinese Eatery

On my latest culinary venture, I ventured into a well-situated Chinese restaurant in the bustling heart of Times Square. While the venue's elevated prices were anticipated given its prime location, financial considerations were set aside for this review to focus on the dining experience holistically.

I arrived with a party of 12, eager to indulge in an array of family-style and dim sum offerings. Expectations were high, but our first course's one-hour delay quickly curbed our enthusiasm. Making matters worse was the less-than-cordial attitude of a server sporting a pixie cut, who seemed put out by our inquiries into the lengthy wait.

The pacing of the meal, unfortunately, disrupted the traditional family-style flow, with a mere handful of dishes being presented at any given time, rather than the preferred simultaneous feast. This sporadic service dampened the communal dining experience inherent to Chinese cuisine.

The dishes themselves, while numerous, failed to captivate. Despite the restaurant's opulent decor suggesting a culinary adventure, the flavors did not match the visual grandeur, with the exception of the remarkable jumbo shrimp with mayo and walnuts.

In conclusion, while one might be lured by the luxurious ambiance and the convenience of its location, the combination of sluggish service and uninspiring cuisine makes a return visit to this establishment rather unlikely.",1
1014,"Yes yes yes! I personally come her for one thing and one thing only - carne Asada (with pineapple!!) with an off-the-Menu cheese taco shell. Hubby loves the horchata - it is a nice sweet sip at the end of a salty meal!I first heard about this place online because of those ridiculous food videos that float around (I admit that I'm obsessed). When I found out that there was a place that made tacos/tortillas out of cheese, I knew it was something I needed to experience. I never bother going out of my way to order tacos, mostly because they feel pretty plain Jane to me. But add a shells of chewy cheesy goodness and I will bang down your door! On our most recent trip, I took hubby on a little food walking tour. This was our second stop for savory food. Luckily, we weren't too full yet! Because these tacos were the big winner. One horchata, one queso adobada and one queso carne asada. The adobada was fine. But the pineapple that comes with the Asada is what takes a good thing and really makes it great. You just need that hit of sweet, tangy goodness to go with the salty cheese. These tacos were so fantastic that we then visited the midtown location on our last day. The line can get long, but it moves fast. Don't forget that these cheese tacos are OFF THE MENU. So you won't see them listed. Just asked for a queso taco and no one will bat an eye. But you might have to ask for pineapple on your carne Asada....for some reason it was left off. But they were quick to help me out when I requested some!Something else worth knowing - the quesadilla is just a regular taco with a little queso drizzled on top...not what I expect my quesadilla to be at all....But next time we're in town, we will absolutely grab more of these tacos!!

2195,"Is it weird to go to a restaurant just for their dessert?After seeing that this place sold what looked like refreshing Taiwanese shaved ice, I had to come here after our dinner. Coming in, the atmosphere was quiet. The seating made it seem like this place was only meant for large groups/families, but luckily, there were two seaters for my friend and I by the kitchen.The workers here spoke Mandarin but I'm pretty sure they understand Cantonese as well. We ordered the $5.50 Taiwanese Ice from the section on the menu, which included all the toppings. It's honestly a great deal. And the dessert came super fast!The shaved ice had an amazing creamy taste that I so craved. Minus the fact it had weird textures like raisins, plums, and peanuts in there. Although there is an option to customize your ice, having all the ingredients definitely helped in making it taste as amazing as it did. Do it for the culture and just take out those raisins if you don't like it!The worker ladies may have stared at us funny for just ordering dessert but their dessert was a must try!

On a recent trip to New York, I followed a friend's recommendation for dinner reservations at a bustling spot in the city. Despite our tardiness on a calm Wednesday evening, the staff greeted us with exceptional grace, allowing our night to begin on a high note.

To whet our appetites, we started with their signature drinks, where the Margarita stood out, and anything with smoky Mezcal is a must-try. Tacos were our choice for sharing, with an assortment covering shrimp, pork, and tofu varieties. If you can handle the heat, the Habenero Hotbox taco is a sensational pick, delivering a spicy kick that lives up to its name.

Dessert was a tale of two contrasts. The tres leches, unfortunately, was not to my liking due to the raspberry cream, but the dark chocolate molten cake was a showstopper. Served within a white chocolate sphere that dramatically melts away to reveal the gooey center, it’s not to be missed.

In sum, the dining experience was remarkable, definitely warranting a return visit the next time I find myself in New York City.",1

12545,"Title: A Mixed Bag at Local Malaysian Spot

I ventured into this Malaysian restaurant on a bustling Friday evening, eager to introduce some friends to the cuisine. Having frequented similar establishments in Brooklyn, I had high hopes, particularly for the roti canai, a staple appetizer. Unfortunately, the roti was too thin, tearing easily when dipped into the accompanying coconut chicken curry, which also fell short in the flavor department. This was a letdown as it's a dish I usually enjoy.

However, the meal took a positive turn with our main courses. Highlights included the curry mee, pineapple fried rice, chow keuh teow, beef chow fun, and sizzling beef with black pepper. The pineapple fried rice was a standout, converting a skeptical friend with its perfect blend of sweet and savory. The chow keuh teow and beef chow fun also received our collective nod of approval for their authentic flavors.

Service-wise, the restaurant didn't miss a beat. Despite the crowd, our server was prompt and attentive. The affordability added to the positive experience, with satisfying portions costing between $12-$15 per person.

In summary, despite a shaky start with the appetizer, the main dishes made a strong comeback. Given the service and prices, this spot is worth a visit for anyone looking to explore Malaysian cuisine.",1

Had a fantastic sushi experience in the East Village at this trendy spot with two friends. We indulged in crispy shrimp, crispy rice with tuna, and fried avocado to begin with – all of which were scrumptious, but the crispy rice and avocado truly stood out. For our main course, we shared the MyLove roll, an exceptional take on a spicy tuna roll, and the vibrant Rainbow roll, both boasting fresh, well-presented seafood.

The ambiance inside the restaurant was as delightful as the food, with a modern and lively feel that added to the experience. I'd recommend making a reservation; our 7pm booking proved wise as it was nearly full by 8pm on a Tuesday. Service was on the slower side, but it didn't detract from our leisurely evening.

Pricing felt just right considering the quality. As a relatively new establishment, some growing pains like staffing seem to be present, but nothing that impacted our visit too much. I'm already looking forward to my next sushi outing here.",1
1887,"Szechuan Mountain House is a modern Chinese restaurant offering up traditional peppercorn-studded dishes updated for the Instagram age. This means that you can get thin slices of pork belly hanging on a clothesline above a pool of chili oil rather than swimming in it, and that the dining room is more reminiscent of a rustic village than the no-frills aesthetic of your typical Chinatown spots.An outpost of a popular Flushing restaurant, this St Marks spot draws a steady crowd of NYU students and mala seekers from across the city. An hour wait is standard for a weekend lunch or a weeknight at a normal time (I shudder to imagine weekend nights). But what they're coming for is less the photogenic bait, which often winds up bland, than the tingling, ugly-delicious dishes filled with offal: strapping cattle throat, ox tongue, chicken feet.Thankfully, I had friends better versed in these cuts and was pushed out of my comfort zone. Tripe and tongue ($10) was awesome-- the sauce was spicy but not overwhelming, and the textures were actually really nice.Fried pig intestines ($24) were an unexpected highlight. Of course anything fried and covered in chili peppers is going to be amazing, but this reminded me of a cross between calamari and the Han Dynasty wings. Good stuff.Blood curd, tripe, and ham ($24) succeeded on the last two, and the sauce is addictively spicy. Blood curd unfortunately tasted exactly like it sounds to me, though I have no doubt it has diehard fans.On the more approachable side, the hanging pork belly dish ($11) was meh; the pork belly was tasteless and the chili oil didn't add much beyond spice. Beef ribs ($22) were cooked tableside, which was cool, but we ended up using the steamed buns and garnishes to make bao sandwiches out of our other dishes rather than savoring the beef.Fried rice with pineapple ($17) should be called fried rice in pineapple, really, and was both a fun addition and very necessary to cool off from all the heat. Nothing here was that individually overwhelming, but it does add up and I was ready for a glass of milk.We had 6 dishes across 4 people, which was a bit ambitious. Prices weren't bad-- it was about $35 per person after tax and tip, with no drinks. Service is fine, and mostly focused on managing the crowd. Plates and presentation are great, and tea is served in cute glasses.Szechuan Mountain House is not something I often put on my dining list, as you need to be with a group of people both excited for it and willing to wait. But I definitely need to come back here and explore more.",0
20687,"This is a classic go to place for me. Great food great drinks. Tropical storm is actually a delicious margarita- made with pineapple- so I definitely recommend getting it! Also we got the prickly pear shots after checking in and they were so good the empanada appetizer is my favorite so definitely recommend that as well! all the entrees come with a side of rice and beans which is a huge plus. Guac is delicious and chips are made there I believe as well. Had the chicken tacos which were delicious and Fresh. Friends had the carnitas tacos and chicken quesadilla and they had no complaints. The esquites are delicious as well. My only complaint is the wait is long. And this last time we went, the host took my number down, texted me and told me it would be an hour wait. After an hour went by we went in to check on our table and they told us they cleared the waitlist even though we never got a text? The hostess then questioned me (which was kind of rude and annoying since it was the hosts fault)and then after I showed her the confirmed text she told her manager and he helped us get seated. Manager was helpful and great- also our waiter was great and very sweet",0
10478,"Title: A Satisfying Sunday Feast with a Twist of Five Spice

My return to this local gem on a recent Sunday to sample their pork chop offerings left me pleasantly surprised and content. The pork chop rice featured a perfectly fried piece of pork, avoiding the common pitfall of dryness and elevated by a distinctive hint of five spice seasoning that set it apart from the usual fare found in Vietnamese and Korean establishments. This tantalizing seasoning also infused the accompanying rice, creating a harmonious dish.

Tempted by the soup options, I dived into the pork chop noodle soup, which echoed the merits of its rice counterpart, complete with the same savory meat and enhanced by the presence of chopped pickled mustard greens, adding a welcome tang to each bite.

In a bid for variety, I also sampled the salt and pepper chicken. While the name suggested a peppery kick, the standout element was once again the five spice powder. It enrobed each crisp, dark meat morsel in a rich tapestry of flavor that rendered the pepper almost undetectable. Its delectable crunch could easily persuade them to rename the dish to ""Five Spice Chicken.""

This culinary excursion was not only a treat for the taste buds but also for the wallet, all under $17. Overall, it was a delightful dining experience that I would recommend to anyone looking for well-crafted dishes with a memorable twist.",1
16693,"Title: A Tourist Trap with Tasty Shrimp - Bubba Gump Delivers on Theme

If you're a fan of shrimp and the classic film Forrest Gump, you may find yourself drawn to the recognizable Bubba Gump Shrimp chain restaurant. Just be forewarned: if you visit during peak hours, anticipate a lengthy wait, as its prime location pulls in the tourist crowds relentlessly.

On a recent Saturday evening visit, my wife and I, succumbing to touristic whimsy, found ourselves queued twice before we could finally settle at our table — a clear tactic for managing the ceaseless line of customers.

Service, once seated, was a high note, thanks to our convivial waitress, Kiana. We launched our greasy feast with off-menu hush puppies, delightfully crispy and satisfyingly cornmeal-filled; they were a highlight, perhaps the best I've ever had. My wife's choice, Mama Blue's Southern BBQ Plate, offered up a flavorful mix of ribs, sweet potato fries, and shrimp varieties. I dove into the Shrimper's Heaven, indulging in an assortment of fried shrimp that hit the spot, though the flavors did tend to meld into a single oily aftertaste.

Bubba Gump is unapologetically not for the calorie-conscious. It's fast, fried seafood at a premium, but shrimp aficionados will revel in the available selection. Just be ready for a wait that ensures you're hungry enough to tackle their hearty offerings.",1
21060,"Visited with my love for our anniversary during NYC Winter restaurant week. We had a reservation for 8 PM & unfortunately waited about 45 mins to be seated. It was extremely packed & one waiter told us ""good luck"" while we stood off to the side. In the interim we decided to wait at the awesome bar with the pleasant bartenders. We ordered the USA & France Cocktails, both refreshing & delightful. Finally when we were seated, we had the perfect table in front of The Vessel, a terrific view. Shortly after being seated we received complimentary glasses of Pieper Heidsick Brut Cuvée for the extended wait. For starters we ordered the Thai wings, Yellowfin Tuna Crudo, Foraged Mushroom Dumplings & Steamed Mapo Tofu Dumpling. The wings were okay, it could've cooked minutes longer. The dumplings were tasty, the mushroom being my favorite of the two. For entrees we had Spit Roasted Lemongrass Chicken & the Artic char. The chicken was tasty but the Artic Char was AMAZING. For dessert we had the Roasted Pineapple Upside-Down Cake, Chocolate Tart & some macaroons to celebrate. Overall great experience despite the wait.",0
19002,"I love this place. I'm not vegan or a vegetarian. Did i mention that I love this place? I eat here anytime I'm in the neighborhood. The service is always super friendly. There is only seating for 6 people and the hilarious thing is that it's always crowded but I've almost always gotten seat. As far as I know, this is not a Beyond Meat burger like one of the reviewers says. I'm pretty sure this is a custom made patty by a chef and it's AMAZING. The portions are small, but I get two things (usually a burger and a salad) and I walk away full. This is one of the best veggie burgers I've ever had. Not sure what the haters are talking about and clearly it doesn't matter because this place slays and is always packed. Focaccia looks really good but I haven't tried it yet.",0
15249,"Title: A Hidden Gem for Food and Romance

If I could, I'd award more than five stars to this culinary haven! Their spicy shrimp buns are a taste sensation – undoubtedly my go-to dish. And the ""cupcake"" oysters? Astoundingly large and wonderfully fresh. As for the ramen, it's consistently rich in flavor, with the vegetarian truffle oil-topped option being a real standout.

The creativity doesn't end there, though. The cotton candy and mussels duo is a remarkable fusion, both in taste and presentation. Located in a charming, discreet basement spot, the ambiance screams 'date night perfection.' In short, this place is the very definition of an unassuming treasure that never fails to impress with its food and service.",1
17659,"The food here is inappropriately good, a great spot for post work drinks or afternoon brunch. Bar food, brunch food, comfort food all fused together. I loved the steak and pancakes, be sure to try their incredible cocktails as well. The staff here is very friendly too.",0
21019,"Title: A Collegiate Haven with Great Deals and Surprising Selections

13th Step is the quintessential college bar, perfect for large gatherings – a detail my classmates and I appreciated after grueling exams or to ring in semester breaks. Their wallet-friendly drink specials are a substantial draw, complementing an unexpectedly varied and unique drink menu. Notably, they stock Rumplemintz, a personal favorite usually elusive in NYC bars.

While the spacious venue is a plus, seating can be a snag; the abundance of booths, though cozy, can't be reconfigured, leaving smaller parties to disproportionately occupy larger spaces, which is a slight hiccup during busy hours.

Don't be fooled by the laid-back ambiance—their food punches above its weight. The Reuben is a reliable choice, but it's the tater tots that truly shine, promising a side dish that often steals the show. Despite the seating quirk, 13th Step remains a top choice for students seeking a casual night out with friends, good food, and a drink selection that never fails to impress.",1
14250,"Title: A Return to Culinary Nostalgia at Hak Box

Review:

Stepping into Hak Box, a quaint, almost hidden establishment under the Manhattan Bridge, is like being swept back in time to the beloved flavors of the now-closed South Wind eatery. The minimalist space is as unassuming as they come, with just two stools and a counter, suggesting that the real star is the food, not the decor. 

The menu is straightforward, featuring Hak Rolls, Hak Tofu, and Hak Dumplings – each an homage to South Wind's legacy. The Hak Rolls ($2.50 each) are a feast for the eyes and palate; plump with scallions, these oversized rice rolls are tantalizingly oily and sprinkled with sesame seeds. Though I found the promised ground pork slightly lacking, the familiar taste brought back a rush of culinary nostalgia.

Equally memorable, the Hak Dumplings ($4 for three) are a thick, meaty delight, with a distinctive sauce that adds a modern twist to the remembered recipe. Over at Hak Tofu, the $5 serving delivers comforting flavors, with saucy, scallion-laden meatballs nestled against soft tofu – a true rekindling of South Wind's magic.

For those who once frequented South Wind, Hak Box is a journey down memory lane. Newcomers or old fans alike will be enchanted by the authenticity and affordability of these tasty Chinatown morsels. Hak Box doesn't just serve food; it serves cherished memories on a plate.",1
12109,"After two sizable gatherings at Sup Crab, I'm convinced it's a crowd-pleaser. The restaurant sports a chic lower level, while the upper level boasts a more formal vibe with large round tables. Both visits had us cozily seated at a central arrangement of small tables on the first floor, providing a fantastic backdrop for photos.

The culinary highlight is undoubtedly the seafood boil combos. As someone who steers clear of spiciness, the Cajun Non-Spicy option was a flavorful delight without the heat, though my friends savored the zestier choices. While the a la carte dishes are hit-or-miss, they make for a nice complement to the boils.

Service has been commendable, particularly during my second visit, which surpassed my already positive initial experience. Special mention to Angus for his organizational prowess and to the attentive staff for their efficiency amidst the messy fun of a seafood feast.",1
19683,"Title: Totto Triumphs in the Ramen Rumble

Having ventured to several ramen spots, I can confidently declare Totto Ramen as the pinnacle of noodle soup bliss, surpassing even Ippudo. Their expansion was a wise move, considering the cramped quarters and endless lines at their West location.

Their menu boasts a variety of options, yet the Spicy Paitan Ramen reigns supreme, a delightful bowl that warms the soul with its perfect balance of heat and umami. The Mega Paitan follows closely, but it's the Spicy Nibo Paitan that clinches a formidable second place with its rich dashi flavor, reminiscent of their Tsukemen – a summer special, sadly missing from my last visit.

In summary, Totto Ramen is a must-visit for any ramen aficionado in search of an exceptional bowl that promises to enchant the palate.",1
19738,"I had the pleasure of dining at this restaurant where the cuisine was quite remarkable, albeit a bit pricey considering the serving size of the proteins. We opted for the kebab combo; the chicken kebab was succulent and exceptionally flavorful, though the lamb counterpart did not quite hit the mark, being somewhat tough and chewy.

The orange zest chicken was a standout dish, bursting with a citrusy aroma that left a lasting impression, and it paired nicely with the lamb stew. While the stew was well-seasoned, it was a bit disproportionate with more rice than lamb, leaving me with an excess of rice by the end.

A must-try at this eatery is their selection of sauces. Each one brings a unique complement to the dishes and can elevate the overall dining experience. Despite the minor setbacks with the lamb dishes, I would recommend the restaurant for its tasty offerings and the delightful sauces that accompany the meals.",1
19882,"One of the best japanese restaurant I have been to in nyc. I came here to celebrate my moms birthday and she was well taken care of. They definitely made her feel special and catered our dishes like the hamachi neck to our party of four (usually come in 3 pieces).We ordered the hamachi neck (not on the menu), box of dreams, tekka-don, and the sashimi deluxe to share. It was enough for us 4. The fish was beyond fresh and any additions like ponzu sauce was just a tad to essentuate the fish. The rice in the box of dreams was well seasoned! I know that alot of people focus on the fish but having seasoned rice is very important to sushi. My favorite was definitely the uni with ikura. For dessert, we got mochi on the house for my moms birthday and we also order an extra parfait. Being the fatties that we are. It was good, but there was longing for some more traditional dessert. Now to think of it, I should've ordered tamago. Btw, their tamago is yummm!Overall, they know what they have been doing since 1976. I'm just sad that I didnt visit sooner.",0
17559,"Title: A Mixed Experience at Farmer & The Fish

My anticipation for Farmer & The Fish was high after perusing their online menu, but the actual dining experience did not live up to expectations. The availability of tables on a busy Saturday night despite our reservation should have been a hint.

Appetizers were hit and miss; the Tuna pockets impressed with their freshness and a zesty kick, while the Grilled avocado salad introduced a delightful new way to enjoy avocado with a satisfying crunch. On the contrary, the Fig goat cheese salad was underwhelming, lacking the punch one would expect from the ingredients.

The entrées presented a similar dichotomy. The Blackened tuna was the star, with spot-on cooking and a delicious cauliflower purée, whereas the Thai fish tacos were a letdown for a fish taco aficionado like myself—a bit too bland and in need of more filling. The Branzino, while fresh, was sadly forgettable and didn't justify its price tag.

Service was competent, yet it's the food that should be the centerpiece. Despite the restaurant's inviting atmosphere and chic decor in a trendy locale, the inconsistent dishes left us questioning the value for money. For those looking for an exceptional dining experience, I'd recommend exploring other establishments in the area.",1

Once at the counter, I opted for both beef and pork tacos on corn tortillas. I was impressed by how juicy and tender the meats were. At around $4 per taco, including tax, the price felt reasonable. However, for future visits, I'd advise avoiding rush hour to skip the long lines.",1

It's heartening to witness their progress. The spot offers a selection of basic dishes, though the counter's design obscures the view of the food, necessitating reliance on menu photos for an idea of what's to come.

Their dumplings, crafted from fresh, locally sourced ingredients, don't disappoint in variety. I sampled the Spicy Pork Bao, which was satisfactory, if not remarkable. Other tantalizing options included the Jerk Chicken Dumpling with pineapple salsa, Peking Duck dumpling, Korean beef dumpling, and an Edamame variation for those seeking something different. The concept and freshness are promising, even if the setup leaves a bit to be desired in showcasing the fare.",1
12967,"During my last day in NYC, a friend convinced me to try an Italian restaurant that turned out to be a delightful surprise. My love for Italian cuisine was indulged in a place that exudes a cozy, homey atmosphere reminiscent of a quaint Tuscan eatery.

The food was exceptional – my rating is a solid 5/5. Though not ravenous, I shared a pizza amalfitana, an adventurous choice with lemons that surprisingly elevated the dish. The crust was impeccable, and the overall creation was harmonious. I also sampled a friend's risotto and was thoroughly impressed – it's clear why it's her staple here.

Ambiance earns another 5/5. The restaurant's warm, inviting decor paired with festive holiday lighting created an enchanting evening backdrop.

Service was the sole letdown, meriting a 3/5. Despite our reservation, we were kept waiting for 20 minutes, and overall service was merely passable.

In sum, this place is a must-visit for its exceptional food and ambiance, though it could improve on timeliness and service.",1

1169,"Title: A Culinary Delight with Swift Service

I recently had the pleasure of dining at an exceptional restaurant that took my taste buds on an unforgettable journey. The menu boasted an impressive variety of dishes, making it difficult to choose. However, the salmon sashimi taco was a standout for me — a must-try. Another favorite was the savory garlic fried rice, cooked to perfection.

For those with a penchant for creamy dishes, the kimchi cream pasta, akin to udon in its thickness, is a hearty choice, albeit on the heavier side. The yakisoba, served in a generous portion, and the sashimi slices equally impressed with their freshness and quality.

The takowasa packed a punch with just the right amount of wasabi heat, while the kara age chicken was a delightful dance of crispy and succulent. The salmon carpaccio was another winner, served in a satisfying quantity.

An intriguing addition to the meal was the frozen beer, a novel concept that is also featured on their happy hour menu — certainly a refreshing complement to the meal.

The service was notably swift; I was amazed at how quickly each dish arrived after ordering. It was as if by magic — no sooner had I ordered the salmon sashimi taco than it appeared before me.

Efficiency didn't mean a compromise in the experience, as I didn't face any wait time despite not having a reservation. This place has nailed the dining experience with its fantastic food and rapid service. Highly recommended for anyone in search of a meal that delights and satisfies.",1

However, it was one of the only restaurants with soondubu for delivery, the yelp reviews were great, and I was really craving korean food so I just went for it.When I got the order, I was pleasantly surprised by how well packaged everything was. I was especially impressed that they put the side dishes in this cute little container. They also gave me a pack of seaweed.I really wanted to like the soondubu, but it just wasn't good. The soup was just all oil and pretty much had no flavor. The tofu wasn't really a piece and was just floating around in the soup.

Here, personal space is scarce, but the shared experience of devouring these silken ribbons is mutually respected, even as your tablemates might eye your liberal sriracha habits with quiet alarm.

My shrimp cheung fun, although modestly topped with a handful of shrimp, was an absolute steal at $4. The meal's simplicity practically insists on a generous saucing, transforming it from plain to pleasurable. Next visit, I'm eyeing the curry fish ball noodles. For a mere four dollars, Yi Ji Shi Mo Noodle Corp is a testament to the joy of specialty dining without the wallet woe.",1
18824,"Excellent food, not only for nonmeat/seafood loversI was intrigued by the idea of vegan sushi and they did a great job making it distinct and savory (beyond just cut up veggies). They have a sufficient number of interesting sushi rolls and seasonal roll/dumplings. We really liked the mushroom medley roll. We also ordered the Sunnyside roll and the curry coconut ramen (not huge especially if you are sharing and definitely left me wanting the traditional ramen with fatty pork). When I come back, I will probably stick with the rolls and dumplings. For two people with regular appetites, you probably need to order at least three rolls and an appetizer...the pieces of the rolls aren't huge.I was surprised by the number of people at this location and there was a little wait on a Friday evening at 7pm. This also led to a but slower service to place your order. But once you actually order, the food comes out pretty quickly. Must return!",0
18879,"Title: A Ramen Revelation – Worth Every Penny

I recently visited a ramen spot that left a lasting impression – it was the best ramen experience I've ever had! As a solo diner, I was seated promptly and decided to trust the staff's recommendation, opting for their suggested set. Always eager to control my spice level, I chose level 3, which packed a pleasant heat, though next time I'm tempted to venture up to levels 4 or 5.

The broth was the star of the show – rich, full of flavor, and impressively not too salty, a common pitfall in ramen that can ruin the whole bowl for me. As for the noodles, they achieved that coveted middle ground between al dente and soft, which is no easy feat. The meat complemented the dish well, and the added soft egg was a delightful touch.

I appreciated the convenience of a water station close by, especially with the spicy kick in my dish. While the price was on the higher side at nearly $30, the no-tip policy made it feel reasonable considering the quality of the meal. It's a place I'd happily recommend to any ramen enthusiast!",1

With an array of options on the menu, I was pleased to see that despite a long line, the service was quick and efficient. The seating area in the back can be a challenge during peak hours, but it's worth the wait if you can snag a spot.

Priced between $5-7, the slices are on the pricier side, and indulging in multiple varieties could make for an expensive meal. However, the slices are mostly served fresh. The standout for me was the burrata slice – truly delightful with every bite.

While the pizza could have used a bit more time in the oven for that perfect warmth, it wasn't a dealbreaker. The generous toppings and robust flavors more than made up for this slight shortcoming. Overall, this place is a solid choice for pizza aficionados looking for quality and variety.",1

Nestled in the heart of the Financial District, Trinity Place isn't merely a bar and restaurant—it's a treasure, as my friends and I can attest to. Affectionately dubbed the 'vault bar,' its proximity to my alma mater and current workplace means it holds a special place in my heart.

The recent high school reunion I attended there only reaffirmed my affection, with the food and drinks maintaining their excellent standards. Returning for Happy Hour last Friday, I was reminded of the cozy, celebratory ambiance that makes Trinity Place a standout venue. Its decor manages to be both stylish and inviting, yet it's the grand old bank vault doors that lend this spot its unparalleled character.

My latest visit was solely for drinks, where I indulged in their Friday special, an irresistible sangria champagne, though it's worth noting they boast nightly drink specials. The bartenders deserve a shoutout for their quick service, amiable nature, and impressive memory.

Trinity Place remains an establishment that knows its strengths and needs no alteration. Their recipe for success is evident, and it's a place I'm already excited to revisit.",1

17935,"Title: Disappointed by Menu Changes at Sushi Spot

Review:

I recently dined at a sushi restaurant that had removed its Pado tasting menu on weekends, much to my dismay. The alternative, a $75 omakase, didn't seem justifiable based on the quality offered. Instead, my party opted for a selection of appetizers and rolls. 

The Suviche appetizer was underwhelming, overwhelmed by yuzu sauce and oddly paired with tomatoes—a combination that didn't marry well. The carpaccio, in contrast, was a high note, delivering on flavor and quality.

Our assorted rolls included the Love, Habachiba, Tri-State, Rainbow, and Spider. All were passable, yet not extraordinary, reminiscent of something you'd expect from takeout rather than a high-end sushi dining experience. The heavy use of sauces and mixing of fishes in the rolls hinted at a less authentic approach to sushi, which was disappointing given my previous positive experiences with their tasting menu.

The absence of a proper sushi entrée option on weekends was a letdown. Returning to the restaurant might be considered, but only on weekdays and with the assurance that the tasting menu is available. Otherwise, the visit could be underwhelming for those seeking an authentic sushi experience.",1
18209,"Has anyone ever given Tad's Steaks five stars before??  Well I am and I'll explain....A couple of years ago I was giving a tour of Vienna to a couple of New Yorkers who told me about the poor man's steakhouse called ""Tad's."" They said there used to be several of them in Manhattan but only one has survived till today. I took note of this info but never was with any friends who wanted to eat at Tad's...or it was never convenient to where I was hanging out in the city. That is until Sunday when I was heading to see the musical 'King Kong' at the Broadway Theatre...just a couple of streets up from Tad's. I was meeting my friends at the theatre so I decided to get a bite to eat beforehand.  Well Tad's was a pleasant surprise.  It was both clean and friendly and indeed several of the steak platters were under $20.  Your steak is cooked to order and mine came out just like I asked for it. And though this isn't aged beef from premium cows, it was actually a better steak than the one I had three years ago at New York's oldest steakhouse (Delmonico's) and which cost three times the price. A baked potato, garlic bread, and garden salad all came with the sirloin and I added sautéed onions.  Every table had a variety of condiments for additional flavors. The clientele represented quite a mélange of folks.  Two college kids were next to me, a German couple was two tables away (they def were not speaking Austrian German so I didn't say anything to them.)  At other nearby tables, there were three Dominican women with their flags for that afternoon's Dominican parade, a single older man who looked like he had come from church, a tourist family with a guidebook on the table ... a real hodgepodge of society. And Tad's was feeding everyone and everyone looked quite content. So again this is not an upper echelon steakhouse as you can well imagine but as New York's poor man's Manhattan steakhouse, I think it totally earned five stars!",0
13294,"When the meal starts off with complimentary pieces of cheesy fried potatoes you know it's going to be a memorable dining experience.And that it most definitely was. I stopped by for lunch and was pleasantly surprised to find out that restaurant week was going on. $26 for an appetizer and entree, plus an extra few dollars for a dessert course.I started out with the electric goat cheese dip - a goat cheese fondue mixed with tomato sauce and whole roasted garlic gloves, plus crostini for dipping. This was absolutely delicious. I mean, what could be better than a bowl of hot and gooey goat cheese? But things did get better. For my main I went with the butternut squash ravioli. The pasta was super fresh and tasted homemade. The portion was generous and combined with the app it was a super filling and delicious lunch for the price point.The decor is on point -- the hanging rope lights over the bar were dreamy. This is a great setting for a meal, but I'd also come back to enjoy a drink at the bar. Only knocking off a star because the service was very slow. Don't get me wrong- the service was fantastic, it just took a really long time for each course to come out. Fine for a leisure lunch, just not ideal if you are pressed for time during the workday.I'd love to come back and enjoy a cocktail post-work. Hopefully one day soon!",0
19142,"Definitely a fan of this spot. It's priced very well and you can actually see them cook the meat on the grill. I ordered lamb kebab sandwich on the grill. The owner gave me a free piece of falafel to try which was really good and not dried at all. Next time, I'm going to try the falafel pita sandwich.",0
1760,"Solid 3.5 stars. The positives: Love customizable options - I got a bowl with all the veggies. The service was really good (the guy was so nice! Even though he mixed up one of my sides, he added it in after). The numeric tofu was also AWESOME and i would return for this. Its a ton of food for the price. The rest of the sides were ok but nothing stood out.",0
1960,"Tucked away in the bustling heart of Prince Street, this pizza spot might draw you in with its street cred and undeniable urban charm. While the pizzas boast a generous topping of pepperoni and delightfully gooey cheese, don't expect a life-changing meal. The pies are undeniably tasty, but perhaps not worthy of the lengthy wait times that are commonplace here, especially past dinnertime.

For those willing to brave the lines, this place offers more than just a decent slice; it’s the vibrant atmosphere and the smorgasbord of nearby activities that complete the experience. While the pizza is good, it doesn't dethrone my top pick in NYC, Artichoke Basille's Pizza.

In the end, whether you're pizza aficionado or a casual fan, this pizzeria is worth a visit—if you have the patience and time. Just keep your expectations in check and soak in the local vibe while you’re at it.",1
17335,"Amazing coal fired pizza, worth the hype. Ordered: The Bee Sting - crust was thin & slightly charred around the edges. Tomato/mozzarella ratio to the tee, with the crispy sopressata, chili flakes, and honey drizzle. We're a sucker for the chili & honey combo nowadays. Perfect slice of savory, spicy, and sweet.Food: 5/5Service/Speed: 4/5Price (college student budget): $$Would return & recommend? 5/5",0
15637,"Last time I came to New York, I ate in China Town. This time I knew I wanted to experience something in Little Italy. I found Il Cortile on Yelp and it had pretty good reviews so I decided to come try it. I made a reservation and was seated promptly upon my arrival. I loved the entire feel of the restaurant. I've never been to Italy, so I can't really speak to what it would look like, but this restaurant made me feel like it would be something close to what a restaurant might look like in Italy. I ordered the Fettuccine de Parma and I honestly haven't had better pasta literally anywhere. The sweet sausage they used perfectly accented to pasta and the sauce was PERFECTION. They did have some bread which was okay, but some of it lacked flavor honestly. Anyways, I enjoyed my time here and would definitely come back.",0

It's not only a visual feast but also surprisingly satisfying. A must-visit for sushi lovers!",1
17562,"Title: A Birthday Dinner at Keens with Mixed Feelings

Last night, my husband and I celebrated my birthday at Keens, attracted by its Old New York charm and eager to partake in a renowned dining experience. The ambiance was spot on from the moment we entered, whisking us to a bygone era, and the table was promptly ready for us on the second floor.

Our initial interaction with the maitre 'd, Sonny, was lukewarm until we mentioned the special occasion, leading to a welcoming gesture of champagne before our selected bottle of Gran Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon from Mendoza, Argentina. This touch of hospitality paired well with the wine, which was a highlight of the evening.

Opting for the porterhouse for two, cooked medium rare, our expectations were set high, at both the reputation of Keens and the steep price point in mind. However, the steak, while adequately cooked, was bland, needing additional salt to enhance the flavor. Accompanied by hard bread, rather than the soft warm rolls we would have preferred, and a creamed spinach that also missed the mark, the meal didn't live up to the anticipation built for such an establishment.

Service-wise, our server Andres stood out with his undeniable warmth and infectious smile, even if his alternative offer of steak sauce couldn't make up for the lack of Tabasco I desired. His recommendation was polite, but didn't align with my preference, which was a minor letdown in the grand scheme.

To our surprise and disappointment, the promised birthday gesture of key lime pie never arrived, leaving a bittersweet taste on a night meant for celebration. Despite the excellent wine and moments of friendly service, the inconsistency and culinary underperformance were enough to make us question whether a different selection or perhaps just an off night was to blame. Unfortunately, we left contemplating if our special occasion would have been better served elsewhere.",1
3484,"Food is probably 3.5 star but the service was just horrible. Waiter and waitress were fine besides pretty slow, but the host lady and the suited host guy was just terrible and unfriendly. If you don't enjoy your job, leave the hospitality industry. We, as your client, not coming here to spend money and watch your attitude. Cocktail was meh, not sophisticated at all. Nice wine options for the bottle, we had a 2013 Barolo which we enjoyed a lot (definitely need decanter though) Polenta Fries - pretty delicious but would be even better if theres more texture. Still enjoyed a lot and I'd come back for it more. Flower Salad - a bit on the boring side, might be that I asked for light ok dressing, but then it was almost no dressing. Octopus - it was fine like everywhere else. Besides the hosts, it is a nice spot especially in the summer time with its outdoor seating. Steak - my friends had it they seemed happy.",0
17692,"Yeah, I'd definitely return! The food was bangin! And the unlimited mimosas.... always a plus!We went here to meet with some friends from out of town and I was trying to play like I wasn't even hungry. We were a little late, so they were already wrapping up, so we said we'd sit at the bar in front.. then, I took a look at the menu and my mouth started watering... I immediately gravitated toward the ackee avocado toast.. I mean, how could anyone in the right mind NOT!? It was divine... especially when I added the pickapeppa sauce. The only thing is that my husband and I both admitted that we hadn't really tasted any ackee in the dish... maybe the consistency blended in with the egg? Not sure, but we were both very full and happy as we washed down with the mimosas..My LO got mac and cheese which was ANYTHING typical for kids.... It was smack yo mama good.. made by someone's auntie or grandma in the back. It was baked to perfection which just the right amount of cheese all mixed in with penne pasta. YUMMMY!!!Our waitress was pretty and friendly, but sometimes seemed as though she was ignoring me on purpose as I waited for my next round of mimosas. ??The space is colorful, vibrant, and warm.. definitely reminds you of being in JA.Can't wait to come back and try the rest of the menu!!!!",0
1674,"What a treat! I dined here solo not too long ago when my partner was out of town for work. Since I was by myself it was easy to get a seat but it was pretty packed even though it was fairly early in the evening. I ordered a couple of plates and went with the staff's recommendations for wine. Both dishes I had was phenomenal and the wines were also excellent! I ended up chatting with my neighbor who was also dining solo and it was a lovely dinner. A little bit on the pricey side but the quality of the dishes and the fantastic range of wines both make it worth the price tag in my opinion. Perfect for an intimate dinner date or for anyone who's a wine geek of sorts. And what I loved was that the entire atmosphere and service was unpretentious and casual enough for anyone to feel comfortable. As a side note, I also very much enjoyed my dining experience at their sister restaurant Contra so if you like Wildair and haven't been, I highly recommend it.",0
14359,"Went for lunch with my coworkers for a farewell luncheon. There was about ten of us.  Restaurant was nice, food was great, server was a little rough on the edges.  It could have been the Italian New York responses, but other than that everything was great.  We walked from our office here, there is not a parking lot, and I did not see any cars parked nearby.",0
15294,"Dim Sum Palace is an ok place to have dim sum on Restaurant Row. The dim sum is ok, the service is variable and the ambience is a little old. (The Palace needs a fresh coat of paint and to fix restroom fixtures instead of duct taping door handles). K and I had dim sum with two friends here. The dim sum is ordered via a sheet (afterwards, you hand the sheet to the waiter). The space is too small for dim sum carts. The price is a third higher than Manhattan and Brooklyn's Chinatown. We ordered the following:Pu-erh tea ($8 per table). It was ok tea, made with tea leaves but the price was shocking. They kept refilling it, which was fine but didn't add new leaves.Har gow/shrimp dumpling- this was ok. The skin was translucent and sticky and the shrimp was enough. Shu mai- this was laughably small (half a thumb sized) and obviously frozen. Seafood shu mai- this tasted better but one had a bits of bamboo.Chicken feet- this was soft gelatinous and well flavored. Not badPork soup dumplings- it was ok. The skin was a little thick and not completely steamed so there was raw dough in the dumpling skin.BBQ pork buns- this was ok. They were steamed properly and had good flavoring. Duck spring roll- this was crispy, missing some mushrooms and the meat was a little dry. Sheng Jian Bao- This was supposed to be a big soup dumpling with a crunchy bottom and a thicker skin. It was steamed dumpling with very little filling and barely browned on the bottom. It was sad. Turnip cake- it was ok. The pieces were big but were missing pieces of daikon. Shrimp rice roll- this was one of the better dim sum. The rice roll was sticky and the shrimp was crisp and fresh as possible. Egg yolk cream bun or Lao sao bao- this was the best dim sum here. The yolk was sweet and smooth and had pieces of egg yolk. Service: The waiters were very nice. We had frequent tea refills. But the owner complained loudly about how long we sat there. (He complained in Chinese, which we all understood).Reorder: La sao bao, seafood shumai, shrimp roll.Protip: This is acceptable dim sum if you are Midtown. If you want to pay similar prices and don't want to go to Chinatown, try Tim Ho Wan. The setting is nicer, the food is much much better.",0
2394,"I walked into this place and knew there was some connection with cafe china. I was right! I am going to go back and order a better entree. I ordered something not to my liking and that's not their fault.Decor is classy and very spacious (in contrast to cafe china) and service was good. They did have reservations from 6:30 so we had about 1.5h to finish our very early dinner. Try their 'in the mood for love' cocktail. It is delicious. also, their old fashioned comes with a twist. Thanks to Yelpers, we ordered the radish puffs and they were heavenly. Crispy puff pastry encasing the light, savory meat inside. Of course no meal is complete without crab soup buns so that was our second order. The dongpo pork is less quantity to be an entree. But steamed buns are perfect (momofuku types) and pork is fatty and meaty and all things good.I am usually very good when it comes to ordering but i made a mistake. SO i will have to go back and order better and probably end up giving them 5 stars. Ordered their most popular dish fish blossom (i think that's the name). The fish was batter fried which made it not that soft. Next it comes in this sweet (they say it is spicy too) sauce that is sticky. I did not like that at all!",0
16227,"After hearing endless praise from my vegan friends, I finally visited this much-talked-about eatery, spurred on by a craving for something fried yet healthy. Upon arrival, I was promptly lured in by the promise of a happy hour from 4pm to 8pm, featuring tempting $5 deals. Though I was initially disappointed by the lack of cocktails and beers on the happy hour menu, I settled for a room-temperature can of Merlot, which proved to be a satisfactory accompaniment.

The real stars of the visit were the generously portioned $5 nachos and fries. The quality of these vegan dishes was remarkable, with both items standing out on their own merit. Dressed with vegetables and a convincing vegan cheese, they were deliciously satisfying. The vegan meat was notably well-seasoned, although the texture gave away its plant-based origins, it was a minor detail in an otherwise enjoyable dish.

Overall, this spot won me over with its great value and tasty vegan offerings, leaving me eager to return for another round, perhaps to try the burgers next time. A great find for vegans and the vegan-curious alike!",1
11142,"Went to Benjamin Steakhouse Prime to try their surf & turf.  Appetizers we ordered Canadian Bacon $6 per slice, reasonable price. We also ordered Jumbo Lump Crab Cake at $26, you would think at least there's two crab cake and lots of crab.  It comes with ONE crab cake, and is not Jumbo Lump crab.  This dish, it's not worth it.  I feel the most is about $12 to $15.  The reason I came here is for their Surf & Turf.   Listed on the menu as ""9 oz. filet mignon, 2 oz. lobster, 2 oz. shrimp, 1 oz. King crab.  I order my steak Medium.  When I first cut my steak, it is not tender.  Took a first bite, it was very SALTY & way overcook and dry, I told myself, maybe is the outside only.  I cut into the center, the center is not pink or red, it is brown which is way over cook.  Is a steakhouse, how can you over cook a steak?  And you call yourself a steak house?  The side, we ordered: Mashed potatoes is not creamy and very bland. Creamless creamed spinach taste awful, Crispy Brussel Sprouts taste way crispy just like potatoes chips, Lobster Mac & cheese is pretty good.  As for dessert, I have Pecan Pie.  It doesn't taste good.  Overall, beside the Bacon is really good.  Everything is not that good.  There's not much of service also.",0
20456,"Get here early as there's a designated waiting line area outside. As Mr. Flay says, this place is awesome bc it keeps it simple and fresh. Always go with steak if you're a carnivore and the drinks are interesting too. You're going to need more than 3 for sure. Cheers",0
18828,"Title: Totto Triumphs for a Ramen Skeptic

As someone who steers clear of ramen, it takes a gem like Totto to change my tune. Their broth is a revelation—undeniably the yummiest and richest I've had. I opted for the classic dish, complemented by the pork belly, and both were nothing short of culinary perfection. The pork belly deserves a special mention for its succulence and thickness—a true delight for the taste buds.

New York trips are now synonymous with Totto visits for me, as it firmly holds the top spot in my world ramen ranking, outshining competition like Ippudo, which paled in comparison during a recent taste test.

The only gripe? The wait time. Brace for a lengthy queue, especially in the summer heat, but know this: the crowds flock for good reason. Totto is a must-visit for anyone, ramen enthusiast or not.",1
12900,"I came here on a date and was not particularly impressed by the food. It wasn't bad, but I also didn't feel it was worth the price they were charging for it. We ordered the ""raw"" mango kulcha, the wilted spinach kulcha and the cottage cheese paneer rolls. We each also had a glass of wine, which was 30% off that night. I was expecting the raw mango kulcha to be a cold mango filling in a warm kulcha, but the mango tasted like it was indeed cooked. That didn't really bother me as much as how spicy the kulcha was (they were very generous with the red pepper flakes inside the mango), and how the dish came topped with a goaty-tasting yogurt, which wasn't mentioned on the menu and, in my opinion, kind of clashed with the flavor profile of the kulcha. The wilted spinach kulcha was not bad, but it was also quite spicy. I liked the burrata and tomato ""chutney"" on the side, and how all those flavors came together well. I was expecting the deep-fried ""paneer rolls"" like you find at other Indian restaurants, which is a bready covering over a filling of paneer. However, it was pretty much just a sheet of paneer, with achar on it and rolled up. The paneer rolls were presented well, however the achar tasted the same as what I've had at Kati Roll places, but much spicier. If i were to have these dishes in a different context, they'd be fine, however I don't find them to be worth the prices I paid for them. We wanted to order chai at the end of our meal, and I was a bit disappointed that they had run out of it. The staff was friendly and enthusiastic, however I did feel like my server spent too long talking about too many dishes at the beginning. She was super nice, and brought our food over in a timely manner, but it felt a bit much to have more than 6 or 7 dishes, which were on the menu, to be described to us all at once. The decor makes the place feel intimate, and it gives a good ambiance for a date.",0
17576,"I've been to Ben and Jack's for lunch and dinner. For this visit in particular, I came for their Restaurant Week Prix Fixe Menu ($42). It was  pretty packed however we made a reservation on open table beforehand. Once we got there, our table was already set up.For the prix fixe menus for lunch and dinner, you get to pick an appetizer, entrée, and dessert. Below are the list of highlights from both visits I had here: HIGHLIGHTS- French Onion Soup: LOVE THIS I think it's one of the best I've had. There's a whole layer of melted cheese on top and it's very savory!- Fried Calamari - Add a little bit of lemon on top and dip into marinara sauce!! Great crisp on outside. I'd get the french onion soup over the calamari though. - Petite Filet Mignon: I couldn't come to a steak house and NOT get steak. The steak was solid and came out perfectly medium rare (which is how I like it) The dish comes with sautéed broccoli and mashed potatoes. I wasn't super crazy about them. I ordered a side of caramelized onions, which was a great touch. Although the steak looks small, it was very filling for me. - Carrot Cake -  I don't normally gravitate towards carrot cake when I go to restaurants but I wanted to try something new. It wasn't too sweet and they give you whipped cream on the side. I was SO full from the steak but still managed to finish the whole thing, yum.Service was 5/5!! Our bottle of wine tasted a little old so the waiter went back and got us a nicer bottle. They were extremely attentive. Although the prices are a bit high, I think the prix fixe menu is a steal. Even if you don't come for restaurant week, come for lunch! They have the prix fixe every day for about $33.",0
1342,"I came here with a friend who wanted to try this place based off of reviews. It is a very small cozy little shop which looks like it can get crowded at any moment due to its limited seating.To start, we got the Teppan Gyoza and the Yuzu Wings. The wings were pretty unique while the gyoza were pretty standard for the most part. For the ramen, I got the Tontoro Pork Ramen. It was creamy and rich as advertised. Unfortunately, it was not very filling, even after consuming the broth. Besides that, the ramen was tasty.Overall, I wasn't too impressed with this experience compared to other ramen shops in NYC. I wasn't full walking out and the appetizers were okay.",0

My companion and I popped into this lively spot for a quick meal before a movie, and it was quite the experience. Heads up: it's boisterous in there, but the atmosphere is electric – perfect for amping up your night out.

We dove into happy hour with a platter of oysters, which were the highlight for both of us, especially Jeffrey who adores them. Fresh, flavorful, and well-priced, these bivalves set the bar high. I went for the Big Green Salad, and it lived up to its name in both size and taste, with standout cauliflower that deserves a special mention. Jeffrey's steak tartare was decent, though it left him craving a bit more.

Despite the tartare's slight shortfall, this place has charm and good eats that beckon for a second visit. I'm already looking forward to another round of those oysters!",1

I recently visited a local eatery that evoked a sense of nostalgia for Torchy's Tacos, albeit with a simpler menu. Opting for a carnitas taco, I was delighted to find the meat tender and the ingredients remarkably fresh, maintaining a juicy interior that respected the integrity of the corn tortilla. The staff cultivated a friendly atmosphere, and the cleanliness of the area was noteworthy. Given the surprisingly light lunch crowd on a Thursday, my overall experience was tranquil and satisfying. I'm definitely open to returning for another taco or perhaps to explore their burritos or bowls.",1

The pork lo mein is a must-try, perfectly balancing savory and umami, while the peanut noodles cater to those seeking a richer flavor profile. The affordability of this joint cannot be overstated—with a hearty portion of dumplings and a plate of lo mein coming in under $10. Remember to bring cash, but rest assured, it won't be much. This spot is not just a treasure for sit-down meals but also a prime choice for takeout. It has earned its place on my list of go-to eateries, and I'm already looking forward to my next visit.",1

We caught our seats at 6 PM and were initially a tad impatient with a 30-minute wait, during which we watched the chef's artful preparation of the fish. Despite the initial hunger pangs, the wait proved its worth. The fish served was of top-notch quality, and the creative seasoning added flavor without overwhelming the natural taste. The meal unfolded at a leisurely yet enjoyable pace, allowing for full appreciation of each course. Noticing that our fellow diners at the bar were mainly regulars, it was clear they had good reason for their loyalty. Highly recommended for those willing to savor the experience.",1

14444,"My pizza craving continues this week. And as I'm now working in Flatiron, I had to hop on over to this establishment that I've had bookmarked forever. Yes, five stars (no stupid comments of ""well then what would you rate Per Se???""). Five stars based on a simple concept executed perfectly.  And wow, what great counter service. I walked in and was like ""whooaaa"", didn't even know what to do. The awesome dude behind the counter was patient, talked me through recommendations, and helped me get to the perfect order. We were three people and split pepperoni (y'all know I'm a sucker for the curls/cups), and two mushrooms. One mush topped with marinara, the other mush topic with vodka sauce (you get a choice). It was clearly a three way tie. And I'm guessing all of their pizzas are equally as good. Oh, and the three pizzas we got could have easily fed 5-6 people. The mushrooms were fresh and plentiful, the pep as you can see is obnoxiously dumped ALL OVER.  Red sauce was a touch sweet, but very good overall. The vodka sauce also paired very well with the mushroom.  Crust is crunchy and crispy and chewy. Light-ish, not quite as dense as a Chicago deep dish. I'm now looking for an opportunity to cater lunch from them for a larger group so we can get a little taste of all of them. There are a few nooks and high-top standing tables to eat there, and if they heat up your pizza, you're gonna want to eat it hot there. If you're taking to go, I would just keep unheated in one of those cute custom boxes they have which fit the pizzas perfectly - then heat up when you get home or back to your apt. No bathroom or anything, no frills counter service.",0

20657,"Restaurant Review: Noodle Lovers' Delight with a Side of Disappointment

If you're looking to quench your noodle thirst, look no further! My pickup experience from this noodle spot was efficient and thoughtful – they know how to pack for transit. However, don't forget to ask for extra napkins, and be strategic with your soup pouring to avoid a mess.

The build-your-own noodle soup option was a win. I went with the herbal beef soup base, ding dong noodles, and a safe medium spice. The broth was rich and satisfying, the ding dong noodles were conveniently bite-sized (much appreciated for delivery), and the spice level was just right without being overwhelming.

On the downside, the scallion pancakes left much to be desired. While the size was generous, the flavor did not hit the mark. The pancakes lacked the integrated scallion flavor I was expecting and came across as merely fried dough. The accompaniment of hoisin sauce wasn't enough to save them.

All in all, I’d rate my meal 4/5 stars. The noodle soup was fantastic and hit the spot, but the scallion pancakes were a letdown. I’d come back for the noodles, but I'll pass on the pancakes next time. Noodle aficionados in the CCNY area willing to make the trek will find their efforts rewarded – just mind the walk.

Would I recommend it? Yes, for the noodles. No, for the scallions.",1

15580,"Title: A Dreamy Waffle Experience Worth the Splurge

My friend visiting from Florida and I, along with my daughter, finally decided to try the popular local spot we'd been eyeing for a while. Opting for a foodie adventure, my daughter's choice was an extravagant waffle sandwich – a divine assembly of two crispy, warm waffles embracing Nutella, whipped cream, strawberries, and a drizzle of chocolate fudge. A dish that seemed to be a waffle embodiment of your wildest dessert dreams.

Though I'm not typically a waffle enthusiast, I must confess these waffles were a five-star delight with their perfectly complementary flavors and textures. The decadence of Nutella and whipped cream paired seamlessly with the fresh strawberries, creating a luscious treat that would tempt anyone's palate.

The only caveat to this otherwise perfect dining experience was the price. At $15.00, it was a bit steep for a waffle dish, even one as indulgent as this. Nonetheless, for a special day out, it felt justified. While the cost is something to consider, for a once-in-a-while indulgence, this spot hits the mark. My rating reflects this sentiment: a solid 4 stars.",1
11367,"I recently had the pleasure of dining at the Connolly Pub in NYC, and the experience was nothing short of amazing.

The bartender deserves a shout-out for concocting some truly satisfying drinks that are well worth the price.

Moving on to the main event: the food. The burger I ordered was hands down a well-crafted classic, accompanied by a generous serving of fries. The chicken pot pie and wings both lived up to their reputation with fantastic flavor, but it was the shepherd's pie that truly stole the show – it was simply astounding in its deliciousness.

In summary, Connolly Pub delivers an exceptional dining experience that I'm eagerly looking forward to repeating.",1
12989,"I live right around the corner from this place and my boyfriend and I have wanted to try this forever. They don't take reservations and whenever we walked by it was always packed. Note they also don't have a website with an official menu (old school). Went here on Friday night at 6:15pm as three people and were lucky enough to be seated outside right away as majority of the tables were free. Nice to sit outside and do some people watching. By the time we left, it was PACKED both inside and outside and was super happy we sat outside because it was pretty loud and stuffy inside and pretty dark lit. We were here to celebrate my mom's birthday, and knew it would be a pricey meal because this restaurant is definitely on the more expensive side. They give you complimentary bread to start. Here's what we ordered after our waiter (who was really, really helpful and super nice... wish I knew his name!) listed off the many specials...- Bottle of red wine ($72)- Shrimp and white bean salad. - A house salad with shaved parmesan.- A mushroom special. - Chicken parm (not on the menu and will cost you I think it was $45 or so). - Linguini and clams.- Paglia e fieno (homemade pasta with prosciutto and peas and cream). - And they give you a side of string beans for the table. - And we got a piece of chocolate cake with a candle and they sang for my mom! Cake was super dense and good. Everything was good. Just good. Nothing blew us away it was all just fine. We were pretty disappointed to not experience the ""wow omg this is amazzzing"" feeling and tastes... especially for the price. And the portions were on the smaller side. Probably won't return since we weren't wow'ed... one and done for us. Overall fine experience.",0

13203,"After numerous failed attempts to order through delivery apps due to non-service or high fees, I finally decided to visit the restaurant in person, enduring a 30-minute journey. The eatery presented itself as an unassuming pop-up with limited seating – a spot more suited for a quick pickup than a dine-in experience if you're local.

I sampled the tofu noodle bowl with pork, which was rich in flavor and satisfyingly hearty. Initially, I was too engrossed in the taste to notice, but my companion pointed out an excessive saltiness, a sensation that became evident after finishing the meal. My main critique, however, is the serving temperature of the tofu – it arrived cold, and it wasn't clear whether this was intentional.

Despite these nuances, I left content with the meal, with a special nod to the refreshing cucumber salad. For those in the vicinity, it's worth considering for takeout.",1
14483,This is based off a MealPal order.So it's sort of a pita to get a hold of people to check in for meal pal. Just go to where the food pick up is and say you're there for meal pal. They will provide you the QR code after that point and the burger was immediately ready to take. You just had to fight the crowd to talk to them.The truffle burger normally goes for $14 or so. It had a nice truffle flavor and was overall a decent burger for the mealpal price of $6 or so. I don't think it stacks up with equivalently priced competitors at the normal price. Stars based on value subsidized by that decent truffle taste.,0
10958,"Title: A Hidden Gem in the Meatpacking District

I stumbled upon an exquisite dining experience nestled within a chic furniture store, a best-kept secret of the Meatpacking District. This stunning establishment is more than just a place to shop for high-end furnishings; it's a foodie's delight that beckons even those with no intention to splurge on decor.

Upon entry, the decor takes your breath away – it's a spectacular backdrop for a meal that makes you feel like royalty without the need for formal attire. The vibe is luxe yet relaxed, striking a perfect balance for any occasion. The menu, which I've had the pleasure of sampling during brunch and lunch visits, is nothing short of sensational – each dish is a hit, and their iced latte might just be the best I've ever sipped.

The service here matches the quality you'd expect from such a setting – attentive and top-notch, ensuring a memorable experience each time. Plus, there's an outdoor wine bar and rooftop lounge that becomes a slice of paradise in good weather, offering breathtaking views and a breath of fresh air.

Despite all these praises, I'm giving it 4 stars. I once splurged on their furniture and felt that recognizing big spenders with a meal comp or a modest dining credit would've been a gracious touch. Still, it's a place I'd return to in a heartbeat – perhaps, RH, with your consideration, even more loyally.

342,"Title: A Monthly Treat Turned Culinary Hit

As the designated pizza-picker for our monthly team celebration, I couldn't risk underdelivering - especially with my Filipino heritage whispering the fear of ""not enough food"" in my ear. The plan for six pies shrank to five to accommodate the naysayers, leading to an order of two pepperonis, one Margherita, a cheese, and the show-stopping Baker's pie.

Ah, the Baker's pie - a symphony of homemade fennel sausage, creamy ricotta, and sweet caramelized onions - stole my heart and taste buds. It was a gastronomic revelation worthy of a standing ovation in my pizza playbook. The classic pepperoni didn't disappoint either, especially with the novel touch of fresh basil elevating it beyond the ordinary.

Though my appetite often overestimates my capacity, I proudly conquered four slices, respectfully leaving the greener pizzas to the vegetarians. The only minor letdown was the crust's lost battle with crispiness, likely a casualty of delivery.

Verdict: The Baker's pie was a near-perfect score, 7 out of 8 slices. Next time, I'll campaign for the sixth pie all over again – after all, the more the merrier, and who knows what new favorites we might discover?",1

11489,"I recently dined at a local ramen spot and decided to brave the Jigoku Ramen at a spiciness level of 5x. While I enjoy spicy food, the real issue was the overwhelming saltiness of the dish. The heat didn't bother me—it was actually quite enjoyable—but the broth left me feeling like I'd taken a gulp of ocean water. On the upside, the pork served in the ramen was delightful, with a robust and savory flavor that I did appreciate.

As for the value, the price was on par with similar establishments, setting me back around $20 including tip and tax. The service, however, was a standout—attentive and polite, which made the experience more pleasant.

Should I revisit, I'll opt for a different ramen variety or dial down the Jigoku's intensity to prevent another saline overload.",1
13655,"Title: A Late-Night Thai Delight

After a night at Bean & Barley, I followed my bartender buddies' advice and headed across the street for some late-night Thai cravings. Even though it was just five minutes before closing at 2 AM, the staff at this gem welcomed me with open arms over the phone.

Upon arrival, I was greeted by the amiable Pat, whose warmth shone as brightly as his smile. Despite the late hour, I was assured a quick turnaround on my veggie Pad Thai and spring rolls order. The casual yet surprisingly upscale ambiance of the dining area added to the overall positive vibe.

Service was swift, allowing me to enjoy my meal back at my place, courtesy of a quick LYFT ride. The Pad Thai was exceptional, easily one of the best I've had. Kudos to Pat and the friendly staff for not just accommodating my last-minute order, but being genuinely kind.

If you're after quality Thai food with service that goes the extra mile, even at the eleventh hour, this is the spot. Thank you, Pat, for making my night!",1
16109,"Title: Rolling in Flavor at Arancini Bros, Essex Market

If you find yourself at the bustling Essex Market, make a pit stop at Arancini Bros for a tasty treat that's both satisfying and perfect for sharing. The setup is straightforward – a display of generously sized arancini under warm lights, a clear menu with prices, and an order counter where both cash and card are welcomed.

The star of the show is, undoubtedly, the arancini. These larger-than-egg-sized fried rice balls are a crunchy delight with a variety of fillings to choose from. At 6 for $12 plus tax, it's an affordable and fun way to sample the different flavors.

The ""Bucatini Fritti,"" their take on mac & cheese, is outstanding with its cheesy, gooey center and satisfyingly crispy exterior. A close second, and impressively vegan, is the ""Sausage & Peppers"" which uses Beyond Sausage for a convincing meat-like experience. The ""Classic Ragu"" tastes like a deep-fried bite of spaghetti – in the best way – while the ""Bianco Verde"" will be a hit with pesto enthusiasts. The ""Pizza Ball"" is exactly what you'd expect: pizza in a rice ball form. The ""Buffalo Ball,"" however, was less impressive and could easily be swapped for an extra mac & cheese.

To quench your thirst, there's a choice of cold brew or lemonade on tap, a refreshing complement to the fried fare. While the service is quick and gets the job done, don't expect a warm and fuzzy interaction – it's no-frills here.

In summary, Arancini Bros delivers on the food front, making it a worthy visit for a quick, delicious bite. Just be prepared for a transactional vibe. So if you're all about the eats without the need for pleasantries, drop by and join the rice ball revolution.",1
14234,"Ventured into a bustling hotspot for their much-touted happy hour, featuring an alluring spread of $1 clams and oysters alongside $4 savory bites. The place was teeming with patrons, yet the energy from the front-of-house and bar staff felt dispirited, save for our server who was an exception to the aloof atmosphere.

The happy hour steals included clams accompanied by an enigmatic duo of red sauces — a standard ketchup and a less-than-impressive cocktail sauce that failed to hit the mark. The oysters, however, were a highlight, their freshness outshining the less-than-welcoming demeanor of some staff, whose frosty manners left a lot to be desired.",1
16190,"It is hard to find. The first thing you should know before going is that it's located inside the Marriott marquis hotel, you enter through lobby of the hotel and there's a designated express elevator that will take you to the 48th floor. The pros: - The view is stunning.  You get to see the city lights, a sunset (depending on the time,) you are provided with a napkin layout of the surrounding buildings, and the waiter will name from time to time what you're looking. - There was no wait time, we were seated right away and made reservations. - waiter was attentive and the food came out fast.- The food was delicious!Lobster Mac and cheese was cheesy and had a full lobster claw. the chilled lobster starter was fresh and full of flavor (guacamole, mango, and lobster - yum). Crab cake was stuffed with real crab meat and crispy on the outside.  Peruvian style chicken was a bigger entree than I expected, no complaints as it was delicious. Salmon was good, melted in your mouth and had the crispy skin on the outside.- GF and vegan option are available - ice cream dessert had a variety of sorbet and ice cream.The cons: The pre-fix menu is overpriced $92, they do have a buffet option with 1 drink minimum for $42. The female bathroom was dirty and smelly.   The decor is basic, carpet, old picture frames, low popcorn ceiling and overall outdated...I felt like I was dining at a formal cruise restaurant. You do feel the floor moving a slight bit.  I didn't care for the New York cheesecake it taste like freezer. The cons didn't take away from the experience, the beautiful view, and the delicious food. I definitely recommend this place and will go back!",0
16773,"An unexpected great find in soho! I went on a Sunday around 1pm, and there was a 45minute wait for a table of four, but there are a lot of places to shop and walk around nearby during your wait! The restaurant itself is very cute and hip- was a fun place for brunch with friends. However, the FOOD was so amazing! I've had friends talk about this place before, and it was my first visit, and I ordered the shrimp pasta and the bronte burger as recommended by my friends. Needless to say, both dishes were absolutely amazing. I highly recommend both. The chicken avocado salad was pretty good too, but not as amazing as the burger and pasta! Do yourself a favor and get those two dishes for sure. I also got a bloody mary cocktail which was good too- it had some chili flakes sprinkles on top, andI appreciated the little kick of spice in it. Overall, solid place for brunch and drinks- would definitely come back again!",0
13508,"My experience at Marta was nothing short of delightful, with my lofty expectations not only met but surpassed. The no-tipping policy certainly did not detract from the impeccable service we received throughout the evening. I highly recommend timing your visit for their 9:30 pm deal that gifts a complimentary pizza with a bottle of wine purchase - a steal indeed.

We savored the homemade Ricotta appetizer ($17), adorned with roasted pear, aromatic rosemary, and a drizzle of sweet balsamic, perfectly complemented by the grilled bread; it did not disappoint. The Baccala in brodo ($34) featured exquisitely cooked cod enhanced by a crispy breadcrumb topping, although a tad too many potatoes for my taste, but that wouldn’t deter me from reordering this dish. A little bread on the side would have perfected it for saucing mopping.

The Gamberoni ($32) presented jumbo shrimp with impressive flavor, although unexpectedly head-on, resting on Tuscan white beans that erred on the salty side. The star of the show, the Margherita pizza ($19, or free with a post-9:30 pm wine purchase), delighted with its crispy thin crust and generous fresh mozzarella.

To conclude, the Tiramisu ($11) offered a decadent ending, with its rich yet airy cream, yet left me desiring just a bit more of that indulgence. Marta is a must-visit for authentic Italian cravings - prepare to leave thoroughly pleased.",1
3179,"My recent dining experience at this establishment was quite enjoyable, especially with the added bonus of breathtaking views on a clear day. The culinary offerings were tasty across the board. The salad emerged as a standout, its flavors elevated by an exquisite dressing. While the foie gras was merely decent, the eggs with truffle and bacon delivered a sumptuous treat. The tenderness of the wagyu culotte did not go unnoticed, paralleling the well-executed lobster and chicken dishes. The duck followed suit, maintaining the good quality standard. For dessert, the cheesecake was a highlight with its creamy texture and balance, and the apple dessert satisfied with its pleasing simplicity. Service matched the high standards set by the food, rounding out a very good dining experience.",1
14965,"I was really excited to try this place, since I'm a big David Burke fan. I got an email about 50% off on Friday's from 12-5 and thought it would be the perfect time to try it. The bartender was super nice, but the amount of people at the bar was more than one person could handle in a timely manner. When our third person showed up, we decided to switch to a table because the tables were empty and there appeared to be two servers. Our bartender said we could transfer our ticket to the table, that turned out to be wrong and the manager told me we couldn't move unless we paid the tab and the 50% off was only valid at the bar ""if I'd read my email."" The way he said it rubbed me the wrong way. Anyways, we stayed at the bar to get the discount and I felt really bad for the bartender who now had an overflowing bar and was doing her best. Our food was pretty good, but all the combinations for pizza are a little odd. Nothing traditional, like a pepperoni pizza only comes Hawaiian style and the sausage pizza has octopus. Our loaded fries had mint on them, which was quite the surprise--that may have been on the menu but I didn't see it. I'll probably give this place another chance as the happy hour was a good deal, but hopefully they get more people on staff.",0

17731,"Title: A Culinary Gem on 5th Avenue: Topaz Noodle Bar

As I meandered along 5th Avenue, budget-conscious and hungry, I stumbled upon Topaz Noodle Bar, an inviting spot with a special treat for those who check in – a complimentary lychee mimosa that's both refreshing and barely hints at alcohol, perfect for a warm day.

The ground-floor establishment surprised me with its spacious seating arrangement and comfy chairs. Visiting on a Tuesday afternoon rewarded me with a quiet atmosphere, as the restaurant wasn't bustling at 4 PM. 

Now, the Pad See Ew was an absolute knockout – easily a 5/5. The combination of basil, egg, soy sauce, and just the right amount of spices created one of the most flavorful versions I've ever tasted. As for the Tom Yum Noodle Soup Combo, it's another winner with its 5/5 score. The broth struck a harmonious balance of flavors without being overly sour, and the accompanying spring rolls and salad were delightful. Plus, the Thai Iced Tea at $4? Utterly irresistible and a must-try.

Every dish arrived promptly and piping hot. Topaz Noodle Bar doesn't just serve food; it delivers an experience. For anyone craving Thai flavors that tantalize the palate, I wholeheartedly recommend this noodle haven.",1
20877,"The big pan of chicken is super famous for a good reason. The flavor of the meat is super authentic and the portion sizes are huge. It's just the right amount of spice, a nice burn but not distracting from the other flavors. My friend and I added noodles and split that one dish which was plenty of food for the both of us. The noodles are freshly made and are very chewy, which I love.The reason for 4 stars is that this place is very small, usually with a wait and it's cash only. It's warm in the summer and can feel a bit hectic. Sometimes the waitresses are not very welcoming - depends on the day.",0
16373,"Title: Mixed Feelings on a Local Spot

I recently visited a restaurant that came highly recommended by a coworker, and my experiences were a mix of highs and lows. The service was commendable, with attentive and friendly servers standing out as a highlight. Unfortunately, the food's arrival time was less impressive, as dishes seemed to take an eternity to reach our table.

Regarding the menu, the carnitas were a miss for me. They were excessively salty to the point of being inedible, and the accompanying pineapple, intended as a respite from the saltiness, failed to salvage the dish. This sentiment was echoed by others who had ordered the same.

On a brighter note, the steak quesadilla delivered on its promise of comfort food, being quite delicious. It's reassuring that even with other misses, a dish as simple as a quesadilla was well-executed.

Lastly, the ceviche was a pleasant surprise, offering fresh and adequate flavors, though it struck me more as a pico de gallo than a traditional ceviche.

In summary, the restaurant has its pros and cons, with service being a notable strong point. Unfortunately, the food was hit-or-miss, suggesting that this might not be the destination for those with a discerning palate.",1
19909,"During a recent visit to DaDong amidst an outing to see ""Harry Potter and the Cursed Child"", my friend and I dove into the restaurant week offerings. The establishment boasts a modern decor and an upscale feel that's immediately noticeable upon entry.

Choosing to dine at the bar, we shared various items. The sweet and sour pork ribs, while tender, tipped the scales on sweetness for my palate. The standout was the squid ink truffle soup, a symphony of flavor with a truffle note that didn't disappoint.

For mains, the lobster coupled with saffron rice was a mixed bag – perfectly cooked seafood met lackluster rice. The chili diced short rib fell short, as the meat's inconsistency led us to salvage the dish by combining it with the rice. The adventurous avocado noodle in Sichuan sauce was decent, but didn't inspire a repeat order.

Tempted by indulgence, we added the half roast duck, which regrettably lacked moisture. Desserts were a final letdown; the tang yuan was mediocre and traditional execution missed the mark, while the 'nata' custard left us confused and underwhelmed, resembling an unappetizing bakery afterthought.

The service dimmed the experience further, with inattentive staff overlooking something as basic as water refills even at the bar.

In summary, DaDong didn't live up to the expectations set by its ambiance, and I'm not compelled to return.",1
15591,"Title: Margaritas and More at Refried Beans!

On my latest visit to Refried Beans, I was pleasantly surprised to find the experience had eclipsed my initial dining encounter. The food served was delightful, with flavors that tickled the taste buds in all the right ways. The star of the show, though, had to be the frozen margaritas — expertly crafted, they provided the perfect blend of chill and zing.

While the meal was largely enjoyable, the guacamole did not rise to the occasion, lacking in the punchy flavors one would expect from such a staple dish. It was, simply put, a bit bland and could do with a sprinkle of excitement in its preparation.

Lastly, a word on ambience — Refried Beans is showing its age and could truly benefit from a modern makeover. A refresh in its decor and design would do wonders and undoubtedly attract an even greater clientele looking for a vibrant dining atmosphere to match the excellent margaritas. Looking forward to seeing this gem after its much-needed facelift!",1

Last Saturday evening, my friends and I ventured to Brooklyn Diner, a new culinary exploration for me, and I must say, the experience was exceptional. I indulged in a perfectly cooked flatiron steak, paired with the most delicious French fries and an arugula salad that was elevated by a truly amazing sauce.

One of my companions tackled a mammoth bacon cheeseburger, which not only looked tantalizing but also turned the table silent with its sheer presence. Another friend opted for the lasagna, which appeared to be a masterpiece of layers from afar.

The grand finale was a chocolate blackout cake. Often, chocolate cakes are overly rich, leading to a half-hearted attempt at completion. However, this slice of heaven was both intense and irresistible, making it impossible to leave any behind.

The watermelon soju was delicious too, not my first time having it but for those who don't know it is a carved watermelon where they take the gut of the watermelon and mix it with soju and honey, it doesn't taste strong but a fun drink to drink with a large group of friends. We also had the melon soju which was sweeter IMO and they put a melon bar ice cream inside the melon.. all of the food we ordered were very delicious.

11325,"During my recent visit to a local steakhouse, I was pleasantly surprised by the creamed spinach that accompanied my main course. Despite not being an enthusiast for this side dish typically, I found it exceptionally delicious and it easily stole the show.

Moving onto the lobster mac, it was a decent attempt but fell short of expectations. The dish lacked the rich, cheesy quality one would anticipate and was sparse on the lobster chunks, a disappointment for seafood lovers hoping for that robust oceanic flavor. Additionally, the topping could have benefited from a touch more crunch to elevate the textural variety.

As for the steak, the centerpiece of the meal, it was serviceable but unremarkable. It lacked the depth of flavor and seasoning that one looks for in a memorable steak experience. Though it was not necessarily bad, it simply did not live up to what one would hope for in a steakhouse.

In conclusion, nothing at the restaurant was outright displeasing, but the culinary journey left me yearning for a bit more flair and fulfillment.",1

No meal would be complete without dessert, and the chocolate cake did not disappoint. It was colossal, easily serving four or more, and we still had leftovers to take home. The cake was the epitome of chocolatey goodness—moist and rich.

The ox tongue is no longer on the menu but we went with the quenelle, grilled lamb chop, and the steak. Everything was amazing. The bone marrow was generous and was basically meat butter on the steak. The steak itself was cooked to perfection. The oxtail boulangere was just enough without being too much. The lamb neck had the perfect amount of fat and complemented the Swiss chard. We finished the meal with the rhubarb dessert. It was super refreshing and the buck wheat ice cream was not too sweet. I highly recommend this place. The one thing I would comment on is that the waitress was having a really bad night. She dropped a coffee cup on the floor. Then dropped a knife that luckily didn't fall on my girlfriend's lap. And finally, she wished us a happy birthday instead of an anniversary. She was not very good at all.",0

I recently had the pleasure of visiting the new Top Thai Vintage with my friends Cristina G. and Lorianne W. for a delightful Thirsty Thursday. This spacious addition to the Top Thai family is an ideal spot for groups looking to indulge in authentic Thai flavors.

The ambiance transports you straight to Thailand, thanks to the meticulously selected décor, including tiles and tuk tuks, creating an immersive dining experience. Eric, our attentive waiter, informed us that the shutters around the tables could be adjusted for privacy or opened up to accommodate larger parties – a touch I found quite ingenious.

Our culinary journey began with a dumpling combo platter and the customizable App platter, featuring curry puffs, golden wontons, and fried calamari. The curry puffs were a standout, irresistibly delicious. Lorianne, who follows a halal diet, was ecstatic to learn that Top Thai Vintage's menu is pork-free.

For our main course, we savored the crispy duck over spicy udon – a fiery yet irresistible dish. Cristina was charmed by the whole red snapper with three flavors sauce. The fish, served with a homemade tamarind chili sauce, was a flavor revelation with impeccably fried pieces that delighted the palate.

Top Thai Vintage has undoubtedly become a new favorite of mine. Their commitment to authentic Thai dining and the spot-on flavors mean it won't be long before my next visit. Highly recommended for anyone craving a taste of Thailand in a charming setting.",1

13209,"Title: Charming Spot with a Winning Dish

I recently dined at a delightful restaurant that charmed me right from the start with its well-appointed interior. An additional convenience was the thoughtfully placed cellphone charging stations at each table, which I found incredibly practical.

The menu had several tempting options, but the Chicken and Waffles stood out as the star; it was a generous portion, complete with fries. While the number of pickles on the plate was a tad excessive for my liking, the dish overall seemed like a crowd-pleaser.

I opted for the French toast, which was a tasty decision, accompanied by two eggs that were slightly on the buttery side, and a side of perfectly crispy homemade potatoes. I also sampled the avocado toast, which did not disappoint and would make for a satisfying meal on its own.

Also got to try the spring roll which is served with a delicious duck sauce. Main course comes shortly after - a quarter cut of duck over a bed of white rice and greens. Fairly simple dish, and the duck is cooked perfectly. To finish off the meal, shared the Mango Sticky Rice ($8) - fresh mango served alongside a salty rice concoction.

Once seated, service proved to be a bit haphazard, hinting at some organizational mishaps. However, the beer selection was a high point – notably, the delightful grapefruit beer I settled on for $9. The staff's generosity in offering a taste of a sour pale ale before purchase was much appreciated.

As for the food, I requested the wings to be extra crispy but they disappointingly arrived rather standard and on the soggy side. The ranch dressing also missed a tangy punch, but thankfully, the Maytag blue cheese crumbles came to the wings' rescue.

The interior of the restaurant was notably attractive, enhancing the overall ambiance. It was an average dining experience, enough so that I might drop by for another round of drinks in the future, though I'd likely dine elsewhere.",1
13324,"Every visit to the city necessitates a stop at this gem of a restaurant for me. Despite the limited bar seating, patience pays off with minimal wait times. Freshness takes center stage here, with each dish expertly prepared before your very eyes. Treat yourself to the hand roll sampler, a journey through six distinct flavors that guarantees satisfaction. Each bite is a testament to the power of simplicity executed perfectly. It's a must-try culinary experience I cannot recommend enough.",1
13692,"During my latest visit to the local taco spot, I found the tacos to be quite a bargain – generously stuffed and easy on the wallet. After much deliberation, I opted to try the guacamole. Although served in a hearty portion, the flavor didn't hit the mark for me; there was an indefinable quality that left it lacking. My recommendation? Stick with their complimentary salsa, which proved far more enjoyable and complementary to the meal.",1
2625,"The breakfast here is solid, but not stellar. If you want eggs and hash, it will not disappoint! The coffee is good, and the bacon is crispy. However, for the price I was not blown away",0
10052,"We went for lunch on a Friday afternoon with 7 of my colleagues. They don't take yelp or open table reservations for lunch but they had a lot of tables available to seat us so we didn't have to wait long. We ordered their large guacamole for everyone on the table and I ordered their vegetarian/cauliflower tacos. It came with some rice and beans on the side. The tacos were ok a lil more dry for my taste and also had large chunks of sautéed cauliflower in it so whoever is not a fan, go for the other vegetarian option either enchiladas or quesadillas. Some of my colleagues ordered chicken tacos which were ok too. Overall we had a good time but the food in general was just ok not extravagant. The fact that they charged us $30 for a mashed avacado (guacamole) was a bit disappointing. They didn't make it in front of us too. I would refrain from coming to this place unless we have no option. The food is pricey and a lil more bland for my taste.",0
14856,"Title: A Cozy Spot for American Comfort Food

I recently discovered a fantastic spot for American comfort food, and I'm already planning my next visit! On my first trip to this cozy restaurant, I indulged in the honey chicken and toast - a crunchy, succulent delight that was far from dry, paired with soft, fluffy toast. The poutine tots stole the show, however, arriving in a sizzling cast iron pan. Topped with stretchy mozzarella, rich hollandaise sauce, and savory chicken gravy, it's a dream for cheese and tots aficionados. I've heard raves about the breakfast dip and the loaded hash browns as well - noted for their perfect crispness and flavor. Can't wait to delve deeper into their menu!",1
13212,"Title: A French Gem Near Times Square: Le Rivage

My partner and I chose Le Rivage for dinner before attending the Moulin Rouge play, aiming to keep the French theme alive for the night. Nestled just blocks from the theater and our hotel, this restaurant's proximity to the bustling Times Square did little to deter its charm.

Upon descending a few steps into the cozy ambiance of Le Rivage, we were immediately welcomed by a hostess who efficiently took care of our coats. Despite the compact size of our corner table, it added an unexpected touch of intimacy to our dining experience.

The attentive service complemented the well-priced prix-fixe menu at $45 per person, which included an appetizer, entree, and dessert. The wine selection was ample, with both red and white options fitting the scene.

The complimentary bread service became the perfect accompaniment to the flavorful appetizers - my delightful French onion soup was a cheesy and savory sensation, while my husband's escargot was a garlicky indulgence. We couldn't resist adding plump mussels in a light lemon cream sauce to our starters, which called for a second bread basket for sauce-dipping.

For entrees, we overindulged with three choices: a perfectly crispy-skinned salmon resting on a bed of creamy mustard sauce, a tender filet with buttery mashed potatoes, and a standout seafood crepe that I'd gladly return for. Even the side dishes like broccolini, charred Brussels sprouts, and fingerling potatoes were noteworthy.

We concluded with a caramel flan and chocolate lava cake, both of which were delightful finales to an impeccable meal.

At $225 before tip - including four glasses of wine, three appetizers, three entrees, and two desserts - the value was exceptional. Le Rivage is undoubtedly a shining beacon of French cuisine in the heart of New York City. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a great French meal near Times Square.",1
12844,"This place is a great neighborhood spot. My friend lives near here and it's a perfect spot to grab some dinner and catch up with friends. With that being said, if my friend didn't live in the area the food and atmosphere are not great enough for me to want to go out of my way to come here. The food is good, relatively average tex mex kind of food, nothing super different or absolutely amazing.I had a cheese quesadilla with veggies and it was great! I do love the hot sauces they serve with the meals. The two red ones were super good like I would love to be able to buy and take home and put it on dishes at home.  The margaritas were super sweet, which I was not a fan of, especially if I am paying $13 for a drink I want to be able to enjoy it and when it's super sweet it's hard. But the staff are great! The atmosphere is fun, nice and colorful but not too loud.",0
15696,"Title: Quick Lunch, Great Tacos!

I recently stopped by this spot for a quick lunch around 1 PM on a Monday and was pleasantly surprised by the lack of a line and the swift service. The cashier was notably amiable, recommending the Impossible Taco and Vegan Chorizo. I decided to try both.

The Impossible Taco stood out as the winner for me, with its crispy shell offering an enjoyable texure and the filling so convincingly meat-like that my boyfriend repeatedly confirmed its vegetarian status. Thanks to the soy protein from Impossible Foods, this taco is a solid choice for those seeking a meaty taste without the meat.

Although the Vegan Chorizo taco fell a bit short on flavor in comparison, it was still a decent meal. I'm looking forward to returning on Taco Tuesday, catching some deals, and giving their margaritas a shot. Definitely give this place a go if you're after a speedy and tasty lunch!",1
16754,"It's a great ramen spot, but you would have to wait in line. I waited for about 20 minutes (half of which wasn't air-conditioned), but in my way out, I heard the staff say the wait would be up to 45 mins for someone who was lined up to near the parking lot.The experience is bizarre - they give you an order sheet to fill out while you're in line, and you can finish later in your seat if you don't finish. You customize your ramen. They seat you in this solo booths, but they will seat you near your party. I wouldn't recommend this place if you're party is over 3 people. Once seated, you can call the server with a button, and give them your sheet, and will come with your order. You can order additional menu with a bell call, but the portion size was pretty good.",0
3132,"Recently visited for a weekday brunch with my family and had a delightful experience. The Hudson omelette was a standout - fluffy, perfectly seasoned, and generously filled with cheese, ham, and tomato. Instead of the usual greasy diner home fries, the side of mashed potatoes was a delicious, lighter alternative that I absolutely loved. My cappuccino was skillfully made with excellent foam, though the flavor was bolder than my preference. The friendly waitstaff added to the pleasant atmosphere. I'm looking forward to my next visit.",1
1261,"I recently visited a charming restaurant that serves up a delightful array of French-inspired vegan dishes. To start, the vegan 'scallops' were a hit, both innovative and delicious. The ratatouille was a comforting classic, full of flavor, while the vegan coq au vin was rich and satisfying. The buckwheat crepe was a delightful and hearty choice that complimented the meal perfectly. Desserts did not disappoint; the crème brûlée had that signature crackly top with a creamy interior, and the mousse was light yet indulgent. This spot is a must-visit for anyone craving French cuisine with a vegan twist.",1
16684,"Ever since I came across this upscale Chinese restaurant, I knew I had to try it especially because it has my namesake: Xu is my last name. The interior is elegant and there is a swanky feel to the place. The downstairs level is sleek with a fancy lit-up bar. The upstairs level was sophisticated and a sight to behold: Green vines hanging from the ceiling, dark brown wood paneling and dark blue and gold designs on the walls, along with plush white seats. I came here with a friend for dinner and we shared 3 different dishes, as well as a pot of tea. We were served a complimentary basket of egg waffle, which was very yummy. The waffles were warm, moist, fluffy and filled with custard that was just the right amount of sweetness. The tea we selected was called, Five Elements, which consisted of hawthorne berry, goji berry, shou wu, Chinese date, and longan. This was served in a pretty glass teapot, then poured into tiny glass cups. The taste was delightfully delicate and truly exquisite! I was able to discern the flavor of each ingredient. What impressed me was that the tea was made with the actual, fresh ingredients, rather than tea bags or leaves.For our appetizer, we ordered the Shanghai Truffle Wontons, which were amazing! They were pan-fried and yellow and green in color. These were perfect morsels with pork / veggie filling and strong taste of delicious, mouthwatering truffle. It was my favorite of the evening. Then we had Live Blue Crab with Rice Cake. The crab was great, with wonderful seasoning and tender, juicy meat. However, the crab was still in the shell so it a bit tough to get to that meat. Rice cake was cooked to perfection - Sticky and chewy. The rice cakes had tasty crab flavoring.My friend chose the YangZhou Noodle in Clear Broth, which included pork belly, lava egg, and bok choy. I really enjoyed the pork belly - It was lean so I didn't have to worry about removing the fat and it was sooo succulent! The bok choy was slightly crispy, while the lava egg was a nice addition. Love that creamy bright yellow yolk. The prices are a bit high, but with the Yelp check-in, you can get 15% off. Service was top notch. They were able to accommodate my friend and me at an earlier time. The host and waiter welcomed us and throughout the meal, they made sure we were taken care of. They allowed us to take a look at the 2nd floor. I plan to come back soon for the dim sum!",0
13705,"Manting may appear unassuming from the outside, and the food bar line might give off a fast-food vibe, but don't let that deter you—this spot is a hidden gem. My Friday night visit with a friend at 7 PM showed a bustling, yet efficient operation that had us seated and sipping drinks in no time.

The highlight of Manting is their dry hot pot. A friendly server adeptly guided us through the selection process, ensuring we knew what each ingredient would bring to our meal. Even at a mild spice level, my dry hot pot was packed with flavor and paired perfectly with rice, sustaining its taste even the following day.

We also sampled the beef Malatang on our waitress's advice. While tasty, it shares ingredients with the dry hot pot, so choosing one or the other depending on your preference for soup-based or dry dishes would be wise. The dry hot pot, in my opinion, stood out for its robust taste.

Overall, Manting is a delightful dining experience, from the mouthwatering food to the exceptional staff. It's a must-try for anyone in the area looking for a culinary surprise.",1
3230,"Title: Unmatched Ramen Experience at Ippudo

Review:
Ippudo stands as my top choice for an outstanding ramen encounter, shining as the quintessential ensemble of Japanese noodle artistry. While you might stumble upon superior individual elements at other eateries – a richer broth here or more exquisite noodles there – Ippudo triumphs in delivering the most harmonious and satisfying bowl in its entirety.

The menu faithfully offers its signature hits, yet Ippudo doesn't shy away from innovation, regularly introducing specials that both surprise and delight with their ingenuity. The appetizers follow suit, with a notable mention of the shishito peppers which are, in my book, the finest one can indulge in.

This establishment earns a glowing five stars for its unwavering quality in both service and culinary consistency. Ippudo is more than just ramen; it's a gastronomic journey that keeps your taste buds enthralled from the first bite to the last sip of broth.",1
18072,The ramen was really good! I wish there was more meat in the bowls as they were quite expensive but the ramen itself was so amazing. The broth was deliciously thick and perfect for the cold night. I loved sitting at the bar (?) area and seeing the chefs make our ramen. The service was very prompt. I would definitely return.,0
15303,Came here for lunch with my coworkers. We all enjoyed our meals a lot! we each got a few tacos to try. Definitely a great spot if you work in the area!,0
1937,"We walked in to this place pretty spontaneously as we were in the area, and we were really surprised to see how beautiful is the place from the inside.They have vegetarian option in the menu and when we asked for vegan they just take out the dairy.Honestly I wasn't expecting much, but the food was really tasty and flavorful.We took the burrito and the endalada de verano, which were both great. The salad had unique mix of flavors and not boring at all (as salads that are based on mixed greens tend to be), and the burrito was big and full of a variety of veggies.With Corona on the side, it was a great dinner!",0
17984,Came here on a Saturday night with a group of 9. Each of us got a personal pizza which seemed like more than enough for one person. The Malibu pizza was pretty good but was definitely expecting more flavor for the price. Most of our group had liked their pizzas as well. I appreciated that they had frozen cocktails including pina coladas. The upstairs area is much louder / rowdier while there is a downstairs area with a more relaxing vibe. I think the downstairs area is better for dinner and can hold larger groups.,0
3580,"My husband and I enjoyed a Sunday evening dinner at this delightful restaurant. Thanks to our reservation, seating was prompt, and the ambiance immediately impressed us with its spaciousness – a rare find in typical New York dining spaces.

With my vegetarian preferences in mind, I opted for the tomato beef soup sans the beef. The soup was a revelation, offering a rich tomato base with a clever tangy twist of lemon. A pro tip for fellow diners: do not miss out on the chili oil. It may sound unassuming, but it's an absolute game changer, adding depth with a lingering peppery finish.

This place has won me over – we're already planning our return visit.",1
17515,"I recently visited a local dining spot that boasts a fabulous Happy Hour deal, which was the perfect opportunity to indulge in their infamous seafood tower. The variety was impressive, with everything from succulent oysters to a zesty blue fish ceviche and delicate crudo, each dish more delectable than the last. Although $40 may not be the cheapest option out there, the quality and taste certainly justified the price point. The only minor disappointment was the fried Butterfish, which didn't quite match the freshness of the raw bar offerings. Nonetheless, for seafood lovers, this place is a must-visit. Yum!",1
1518,"Title: A Spicy Delight in Midtown

Last Saturday night, my dining experience at this bustling eatery exceeded expectations – a testament to our wise decision to reserve a table in advance. The food and service both shone brightly. My choice of the 'peligrosa' came with a perfectly piquant spicy salt rim that complemented the drink's nuanced flavors without overpowering them. The margaritas struck a delicate balance, flavor-forward without an overwhelming alcohol punch.

Our appetizer, the spicy guacamole, delivered a satisfying kick, setting the stage for the main event. The Queso Fundido and the black truffle quesadilla, both expertly crafted in the brick oven, were the stars of the evening; their flavors were rich, complex, and downright amazing.

For anyone in the midtown or Times Square vicinity looking for an outstanding dining experience with a spicy edge, this spot is an absolute must-try.",1
20790,"Title: A Serendipitous Discovery at La Avenida

Amidst the notorious New York City summer traffic, frustration led me to seek refuge at La Avenida, a gem tucked away in Spanish Harlem. First impressions could deem it easy to overlook, given its unpretentious exterior and simple interior. Yet, this eatery has earned a well-deserved spot on my Summer 2019 highlight reel.

My initial visit, driven by a severe case of hanger, could have been a fluke. To ensure my rave review was genuine, a second visit was in order. It didn't disappoint. The cuisine was consistently delightful, the staff exuded warmth, and the pricing made it easy to indulge in multiple menu explorations.

The standout, however, was Ivan – a jack-of-all-trades who seamlessly transitioned from bartender to waiter, server, and even the occasional DJ. His engaging demeanor enhanced the dining experience, making it truly memorable.

La Avenida also offers a Taco Tuesday special, perfect for anyone looking to enjoy a good deal. Now, I find myself almost longing for my next traffic snarl, just to have another excuse to return.",1
15493,"I recently tried the custom pho at a local spot I discovered on Facebook. To start, the fresh spring roll with shrimp appetizer was fairly standard, nothing to write home about. The restaurant's interior impressed me, boasting a nice, modern decor that was both stylish and clean.

Sharing a single bowl of the custom pho alongside the appetizer felt sufficient. The experience was interactive, featuring broth heated over a live flame and sides of bean sprouts and lime, though I found the latter to be somewhat scarce. Our choice of meats included sliced beef and spicy beef; the former was good, but I personally wasn't keen on the spicy short rib, although my friend found it delightful.

The main drawback was the price, which felt steep for what we got. Also, the custom pho process, with its dipping and separating, was overly complicated for sharing. On reflection, opting for a classic pho might offer a better and simplified dining experience. I'd give it another shot but would stick to the traditional offerings.",1
10925,"Great breakfast! They have 4 kind of oatmeal: regular, with skim milk, steel cut, and with quinoa and coconut. I asked for a mix of 2 and it was yummy. The also give you 3 toppings but I just wanted fruit (blueberries and strawberries).  I was also happy that they had iced decaf coffee which not all places have. Total $10.50.",0
14669,"The reviews are legit. The food is incredible. The ambiance is fantastic and the service is top-notch! Carmine's is a famous Italian restaurant and with good reason too! It's no wonder why you need reservations to get in at a decent hour! We were a group of 6 and were seating within minutes of arriving at our reservation time. They quickly brought out drinks and took our order. The restaurant is family-style so be aware that the portions are huge. I think a minimum number of people should be 4 because any plate is already too much for two and you want to get a few things, not just one! I swear, our food came out faster than our drinks! The food was fresh and hot and melty and delicious! We were all full but couldn't stop eating because it was so good! For the 6 of us, we ordered three plates and a kids plate and that was plenty, plus we had leftovers. I have to say, everything we saw come out looked so tasty! We absolutely loved the lasagna! I've also had the lemon caper chicken which is light and delicious and comes with spinach! Mmmmm so good! The server, Omar, was great and even took a few pictures for us before we left. We had a great time and walked off the food because it was so filling and so yummy and we couldn't stop eating haha. We made our reservations two days before for a Sunday night dinner and the earliest available was 8:30 so if you want an earlier dinner time, make your reservations a week in advanced if possible. It's seriously worth the tiny hassle. There's multiple locations too so make sure to compare the two when looking to reserve! Now I want Italian for lunch... lasagna anyone? ;)",0
17881,"I popped into the eatery for a speedy bite and sampled their pepperoni pizza slice, which was a solid, quintessential New York style—no frills but satisfying. The garlic knots, however, fell a bit flat; they seemed to have lingered on the counter for a while, and even a brief reheat couldn't quite resurrect them. Thankfully, a generous helping of marinara sauce made them passable. I'm willing to give this place another shot during a busier time in hopes of snagging some fresher options.",1
12734,"Recently, my family and I decided to celebrate Father's Day with Vietnamese cuisine and ended up at Sai Gon Dep in Manhattan, veering from our routine trip to Flushing. The lure was their alluring $120 Weekend Tomahawk Special, which did not disappoint. The 60-day dry-aged, 40+ ounce bone-in ribeye from Pat LaFrieda Beef was the highlight of the meal. Served medium rare, it was incredibly rich and full-flavored, coupled with succulent bone marrow accented with sea salt and garlic chips.

The accompanying 26-hour beef broth with rice noodles was a comforting revelation, loaded with garlic, herbs, and was one of the city's finest pho renditions. However, the Chinese fried crullers didn't meet expectations and were a letdown compared to other versions I've tasted.

Apart from the steak special, the Grilled Pork Summer Rolls and the Chicken Pho were both commendable. Service was amiable, although occasionally inattentive. The ambiance of the restaurant was cozy with tasteful decor. Despite the slight hiccups and a price point that's a stretch, the overall experience warrants a solid 7 out of 10. I'm tempted to return, if not for the pho then certainly for the steak.",1
19641,"Title: An Unfortunate Culinary Misstep

I chanced upon this establishment after spotting two ladies handcrafting dumplings through the window, a scene reminiscent of my favorite Dumpling House on Spadina Avenue in Toronto. Compelled by nostalgia, I ventured inside, greeted by the restaurant's clean and unassuming decor.

Opting for the small portion of chive pork dumplings (App Mewl Mandoo) proved disappointing. The dumplings were encased in a thick, doughy skin, overshadowing the excessively dense filling—lacking the delicate balance and texture I so fondly remembered from my Toronto haunts.

Regrettably, my search for an exceptional dumpling experience in New York persists. This visit didn't meet the mark, and I won't be returning.",1
10582,"Ate here with a friend tonight and had a great experience! The ambiance is fun, great music playing, and a nice change from the other restaurants on the UWS (make sure you check out the bathroom!). You're greeted with complimentary sake which I thought is a great touch. The staff is friendly and very accommodating/willing to answer any questions you might have. The menu is affordable filled with stuff that's easily sharable. Everything we tried while not the healthiest, was delicious. Looking forward to returning and trying other dishes. Chicken bao buns- comes with 2 to an order. Came out hot and good meat to bun ratio Cheesy corn - huge portion for the price. This is a must get!Eggplant tempura- the one thing we ordered that I can do without next time Vegetable gyoza - nicely fried with a good dipping sauce",0
3524,"Title: A Delightful Twist at Rosemary's After the Panini Pop-up

After an unexpectedly lengthy wait at a local Italian panini pop-up, my friend and I found solace at Rosemary's. Despite the setback, our experience at Rosemary's was nothing short of delightful. The outdoor seating offered us a pleasant ambiance, and to our surprise, the service was notably swift.

Having just returned from a trip to Italy, the sight of spritz on the menu sparked an excitement in me. I opted for their special spritz which proved to be a refreshing and delicious choice – a perfect tribute to my Italian getaway. 

The Neapolitan brunch was my food of choice, and it was an absolute triumph. Each bite was a reminder of why I love Italian cuisine; it was so scrumptious that I found myself cleaning the plate with enthusiasm. 

Unfortunately, I experienced a minor misfortune when I left my corn on the cob, intended for a Central Park picnic, behind at the restaurant. Nonetheless, the savory meal and alluring spritz at Rosemary's provided a small consolation for my forgotten picnic treat.",1
3374,"Title: A Satisfying Mother-Daughter Brunch at Bistro Verde

My daughter and I had a delightful brunch experience at Bistro Verde on November 10, 2019. Without the need for reservations, we were promptly seated upon our 11 am arrival at Nordstrom.

The service was commendable, with our attentive server Bruno efficiently taking our order soon after we settled in. We started with a delightful complimentary Açaí Grape Smoothie Shooter, while my daughter enjoyed her coffee, despite a slight milk preference hiccup.

Our generous plates soon arrived, each featuring an impressively large biscuit – the highlight of our meal. Though the potatoes fell short of their crispy promise, the rest of the food did not disappoint. My 2 Egg Breakfast with bacon (initially mistaken for sausage) was promptly corrected, and my daughter's Warm Biscuit & Chicken Sausage Gravy included a pleasant surprise of additional chicken sausage.

The meal concluded with Bruno presenting us with complimentary chocolates, a sweet touch to our filling brunch. The restaurant's environment struck a perfect balance between modern and chic, with employees exuding both professionalism and friendliness.

Reasonably priced and satisfying, Bistro Verde left us contemplating a return visit to explore their regular menu. For brunch enthusiasts looking for a place where you won't leave hungry, Bistro Verde gets my recommendation.",1
19292,"The restaurant's unique concept truly makes it a feast for the eyes, offering an atmosphere that begs for a return visit. However, my initial experience with just an empanada left me underwhelmed. I'm looking forward to going back to try more from their menu and fully assess the culinary experience they offer.",1
10535,"Title: A Satisfying Dive into Xinjiang Cuisine

I recently ventured into unknown culinary territory at a local Xinjiang-inspired eatery, and while I can't attest to the authenticity, the experience was a delightful surprise. The highlight was the Beef Shumai, a delightful twist on the traditional, bursting with flavor and encased in a delicate wrapper reminiscent of a soup dumpling. The Big Plate Chicken, although on the saltier side, had its redemption in the perfectly cooked meat and generous chicken-to-noodle balance. Adventurous palates would appreciate the BBQ kidney skewer—a special touch to our meal. Washed down with a refreshing BeiBingYang soda, this meal left us eager to explore more of what the restaurant has to offer. A return visit is definitely on the cards!",1
13672,"My friends and I came here on a Saturday night and I say it was PACKED. We saw 4 seats near the door at the bar table so we just slid in. I am not a big fan of eating by the bar table but if the other alternative was to wait an hour, I was willing to eat at the bar table. The service was very prompt - gave us our menus, took our orders and served us the food.I had the Grilled Pork and Shrimp Bun. I have to say it was pretty good- I wish there was more sauce to mix with but it was a very tasty meal nevertheless. A downside is that the entrance area was really crowded because there were so many people waiting for a table. As well, the interior looked really cool but I couldn't really go in because all the tables inside were full and we only walked in and just ate near the door. I would highly recommend people to please RESERVE a table.",0
1313,"Burgers are my jam. Like favorite food jam. My first foray into the Au Cheval world was at the Chicago location. I was on vacation and went with a friend. We were told it would be a 4 hour wait, which we had somewhat expected but really didn't anticipate. We stalked the very small bar and scored seats after about 1.5 hours. The Chicago location is tiny in comparison to the NYC location, so the waits seem slightly reasonable there. I was expecting similar waits in NYC but was pleasantly surprised that was not the case. Only once when I tried to eat on an impromptu Friday at 7 was I met with a long wait. Any other time, I've managed to hit it at the right time, or use the Resy app to score a reservation. Something they don't do (last I checked) at the Chicago location.I've been here a few times now, and the burger has only improved each time. I went the first week after opening and it wasn't quite the burger I remembered (love at first bite) in Chicago, but they've really honed their burger rhythm to match Chicago in the visits since then. I typically get the single cheeseburger as it comes, not adding any extras. Just a note, the single has two patties. When I went to the Chicago location, I added the bacon, which is a flavorful thick cut bacon but I don't think it's necessary. I liked the burger and the toppings it comes with bedt as it is. On my last visit I ventured outside of my standard burger selection and tried the fried housemate bologna sandwich. Man, was that good. It was a tower of thinly slocdc bologna with melted cheese and the same sauce as the burgers. It just melted in my mouth and was the grown up gourmet version of the bologna sandwiches I'd loved as a kid. For drinks, I've gotten the draft root beer as well as the Bloody Mary. Both are delicious options depending on your mood.I've come here for a couple celebratory dinners, and they always have cute touches - even putting a sparkler in my burger when I was here on my birthday. They'll put one in your dessert if you get one too, but I feel like a sparkler in a burger is just more fun.I've had a friend get the kale caesar, and another get the omelette. Everyone I've gone with has always enjoyed whatever they've ordered. Another time a friend ordered the crispy potato hash with the mornay sauce, garlic aioli & fried farm egg...SO GOOD. It's tough because I never have room for more than the burger and fries (and thats with typically sharing the fries) but I want to try so many things on this menu. Both their wings and their bone marrow are supposed to be amazing.If you have a wait, there's a coffee shop inside the restaurant called Sawada Coffee and downstairs there's a small bar with its own cool vibe where you can chill and order drinks and fried chicken menu items or fries. I haven't tried anything from the bar downstairs yet, but I've tried the Sawada Coffee matcha black camo latte which I really enjoyed. Also service is great here, and incredibly efficient. You can get in an out quickly if needed, but also leisurely eat if you prefer. They won't rush you. When I visited for my birthday, a friend from out of state was able to coordinate a birthday surprise of a glass of rosé and contributing to our bill. It was so sweet and very stealthily done. I haven't had a negative experience here yet and now I'm hungry and trying to figure out when I will be back.",0
18475,"Title: Pleasant Surprise at the Neighborhood Eatery

I approached this restaurant with a hint of skepticism due to a past experience at their Upper West Side branch, but I was pleasantly surprised this time around. Visiting on a tranquil Saturday afternoon, the restaurant provided a peaceful setting for a delightful meal.

The shared rigatoni was the star of the show. While it may not rival the famed Carbone's, it offered a delicious and more affordable alternative that left us both impressed. The chicken parm sandwiches that followed were enjoyable, though the chicken was slightly chewier than I would have preferred.

Despite the sparse attendance, the service was impeccable — attentive and unobtrusive, contributing to a very positive dining experience. This visit has shifted my perspective, and I'm inclined to return when I'm in the area or perhaps try another one of their locations for another taste of their heartwarming cuisine.",1
20404,"Last night's delivery from this spot was a pleasing experience overall. I opted for the buttermilk fried chicken sandwich accompanied by herb fries. While I personally prefer my fries on the crispier side, the rosemary touch was a delightful compensation. The sandwich itself—composed of a boneless thigh topped with tomato, lettuce, pickles, and a spicy sriracha aioli on a toasted brioche bun—hit the taste buds just right, despite the presence of a few small bones and a slightly over-charred bun. Impressively, the food arrived punctually and maintained its heat. At $18, the portion served was substantial and ensured a satisfying meal. I can comfortably vouch for giving this restaurant a try.",1
2156,"Title: A Charming Brunch Experience at Gran Tivoli

My recent visit to Gran Tivoli for an Italian brunch was nothing short of fantastic. The establishment greeted us with such a warm welcome that set the tone for the entire meal. Our taste buds were tantalized by the unique combination of tuna crostini paired with uni, a delightful start to our brunch.

The bread basket was a hit, with the chocolate meringue standing out as a memorable treat. The marriage of prosciutto and buffalo mozzarella was classic and satisfying, while the “Brain Food Bowl” offered a refreshing alternative that certainly didn't skimp on flavor.

Our kids were overjoyed with the scrumptious chocolate pancakes, which were a sweet highlight of their meal. The coffee was robust and complemented our dishes beautifully, while the decor and attentive service added to the comfortable and inviting atmosphere.

Gran Tivoli has left us eager to return and explore their full bar and dinner menu. Highly recommended for a delightful brunch that caters to all ages.",1
296,"Honestly just another very strong brunch place to hit up downtown. I can't say there is something I particularly disliked or liked, because the quality of their food is very solid. I ordered a HUGE sandwich and it came along also with a HUGE plate of rosemary fries. I was particularly craving some fries so that was a huge plus. The french toast was fluffy and soft according to my friend, and the smoked salmon benedict had a gorgeous yolk drip. Although, the greens on the side of the benedict did seem a little wimpy. This wasn't my first time coming here, and both times there wasn't anything mindblowing, but the overall experience was quite pleasant.",0
14827,"Title: A Theatrical Culinary Experience at Danji

My dining companion and I chose Danji for its convenient location near the theatre district, as we were heading to see Jeff Daniels in ""To Kill a Mockingbird"". The vibrant energy of the place set the tone for the evening, with communal tables and a cozy bar inviting inevitable interaction.

Service was prompt and cordial, a fitting preamble to the culinary spectacle. We began with the hamachi sashimi; the freshness of the fish was commendable, though the $19 price tag for four pieces is a reminder of the NYC premium.

The bulgogi sliders were a standout – a sumptuous combination of tender beef and perfectly toasted brioche that vanished all too quickly. We continued with the stir-fried rice cakes, an indulgent mix of crispy-edged rice cakes, sautéed sausage, and a rich gochujang sauce, all balanced with a touch of crème fraîche.

Moving to the ""medium"" selection, the Korean seafood pancake redefined lightness, bursting with shrimp and reminiscent of the finest vegetable tempura. For the ""large"" plate, the black cod marinated in soy with tomato/gochujang dressing was a masterful display of flavors, complemented by sticky rice.

Finishing with a glass of soju-based sangria, our bill reached north of $125, a testament to Danji's premium status. While there's a tasting menu at $55 per person, a typical dinner for two without drinks will likely hover around $100. Regardless of the price, Danji delivered on all fronts – outstanding Korean cuisine, excellent service, and timely dining before our show. It comes highly recommended for a special night out in New York's Theatre District.",1
20937,"Title: A Hidden Gem for Lunch

Upon my recent visit to a seemingly overlooked restaurant during lunchtime, I was taken aback by the vast amount of empty seats despite its prime location. The ample seating, complemented by large windows perfect for people-watching, set the stage for a pleasant dining experience.

Deciding to try the gyro sandwich with feta cheese proved to be a delight. While I found myself longing for more tomatoes, a minor detail I'll adjust in my next order, the sandwich was undeniably pleasing with its hot, fresh pita bread wrapping the savory filling.

An unexpected treat was the basket of warm, toasty pita brought to the table, a cozy touch that satisfied my appetite entirely.

I'm looking forward to returning to this restaurant for another tranquil and tasty lunch. It's truly a great spot for those in search of a peaceful mealtime retreat.",1
14969,"What a cute place! Walked in on a Sunday night around 7pm for a party of 2 with no reservations and there was no wait and plenty of seating. We sat outside under some umbrellas, which was quite nice.Ordered the seared octopus appetizer and fresh spaghettini with mushrooms and speck, both of which were amazing. Very reasonable prices as well. Will definitely return!",0

The sauce was a good balance of spicy and sweet, and the cucumber and radish worked to cool things down. The hard boiled egg was perfectly cooked in that its yolk was still a little soft, but the beef was both a little tough and a small portion.",0
3400,"Once I stepped into this place everything was pink. They have outdoor seating with pink tables, chairs and umbrellas. I have to say that it looked pretty cool and pink. We sat inside though cause it was hot out and humid. The inside has some unique paintings with lighting that gives it a 3D look. As for the food, I ordered the oxtail bao that was yummy and the nine seasons jumbo prawns. The jumbo prawns was huge and the portions were generous but it was priced at $34 so it was worth for the price. It wasnt spicy but the food was good and the service was good. What I didnt like was the fact that the waiter said that the $34 prawns doesnt come with rice so we were gonna get rice paying extra but there was no white rice listed in the menu and the waiter tried to push us to get fried rice that we refused so he finally agreed to get us white rice. What I dont get is if the white rice was included or did the waiter try to get us to buy fried rice for extra money. That seemed odd. I may come here for the drinks.",0
12036,"Despite initial hesitations due to a low Yelp rating, I was enticed to dine at this establishment, lured by its appealing rooftop seating and beachy tiki bar decor which promised a laid-back dining experience. The view from the top deck, offering a panoramic perspective of the city, was indeed a highlight. Unfortunately, that was the peak of my visit.

Service was sorely lacking; our server's inattention left us parched and unattended throughout the meal. Proximity to Penn Station is no excuse for neglecting the basics of hospitality.

As for the food, it fell dramatically short of expectations. The spicy fries, which the menu tantalizingly described with Parmesan, garlic, pepper, and onion, were a disappointing imitation, reminiscent of fast-food fries with a sprinkling of cayenne pepper. The tostada, meanwhile, managed to be both burned and brittle, contributing to an overall subpar culinary experience.

The lesson learned: trust your fellow diners' reviews, and remember that a restaurant's ambiance can be deceiving. This spot, with its charming exterior and lackluster substance, was nothing short of a culinary catfish.",1
14224,"Title: A Delightful Feast Awaits at This Spacious Eatery

I recently visited this restaurant with a group of friends and had an exceptional dining experience. Upon arrival, the perk of free dumplings through a Yelp check-in offer was a pleasant start. This spot takes reservations, which is convenient, though we didn't need them as the restaurant was quite empty around 6pm on a weekday.

The interior is quite spacious, making it suitable for both small gatherings and larger parties. It's worth noting that the eatery offers specials, creatively presented on a chalk wall. We opted for the seafood soup (complete with noodles) and fried pork combo, part of their two for $20 deal. This was more than sufficient for the three of us.

Moreover, for those interested in beverage options, adding a bottle of soju for just $7.99 with an entree is a steal. Don't miss out on this gastronomic haven that offers value, taste, and space!",1
18006,"Hidden in the heart of Macdougal Street sits a gem that could easily go unnoticed: a satellite of the famous Staten Island Pizzeria. This tavern-style eatery offers an escape into culinary delight, boasting a menu of legendary pizza and classic red sauce Italian dishes that satisfy cravings for authenticity and flavor.

From my experiences— a casual crew lunch and a cozy dinner with friends to shake off a tense week— the quality remains top-notch. The pizza is a marvel in itself, with the perfect balance of thin, crispy, and chewy, leaving an indelible mark on your taste buds. The calamari and meatball appetizers arrive at the table flaunting their excellence, while the Caesar salad holds its own as a decent accompaniment. The waitstaff is attentive, contributing to a dining experience that feels both personable and professional.

The wine list is compact yet sufficient, adding a pleasant touch to the meal. The ambiance is enlivened by good lighting that complements the restaurant's warm vibe, making it a sanctuary for comfort dining.

Easily one of the best culinary experiences one can have on Macdougal Street. For an insider's edge, request Joe and mention my referral. He ensures service that makes you feel right at home, far from the impersonal treatment found elsewhere.",1
11698,"Title: Mixed Feelings at Tenho

Rating: ★★★☆☆

My experience at Tenho left me with mixed emotions. As an avid ramen enthusiast, I approached the meal with high hopes, but unfortunately, Tenho doesn't quite live up to its 4.5-star reputation - a more fitting rating would be 3.5 to 4 stars.

Arriving as the first customers of the day, my coworker and I decided to try the karaage and two varieties of spicy ramen. The karaage was disappointing, overly breaded and lacking in substantial meat - it's not something I'd reorder.

As for the spicy ramen, it was a letdown in terms of heat. The broth was creamy yet lacked the complexity I treasure in a tonkotsu base. It was palatable but unremarkable. Ramen connoisseurs might find Tenho's bowls to be adequate if in the area, but with standout options like Tonchin and Ichiran in the city, Tenho doesn't quite make the cut for a special trip.",1

14053,"Title: A Cozy Spot for a Birthday Brunch Delight at Root & Bone

I recently celebrated a birthday brunch at Root & Bone with a group of about 13 friends, and the experience was remarkable. Despite the restaurant's modest size, making a reservation ensured we all sat comfortably together. The meal kicked off with delicious biscuits and an irresistible gravy - a real highlight.

Side dishes such as the Mac and cheese and potatoes were tasty, but I would have preferred individual servings rather than the communal setting. The star of the show, however, was the fried chicken and waffles; a must-try when you visit. Don't forget to ask for hot sauce, syrup, and extra butter to elevate the dish to perfection.

Our large group didn't affect the speedy service, and I was pleasantly surprised by the freedom to pour our drinks from bottles left at the table, adding a touch of convenience and luxury to our brunch.

Root & Bone nailed it with great food and service, ensuring it's not just a one-time visit for me. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a tasty and efficient brunch experience!",1
10447,"Came in on a Tuesday night 6:45PM for a dinner for two - no reservations needed but the place does fill up quick. We were surprised at how full the place was on a weeknight.We ordered 8 periogis: potato, arugula & goat cheese, short rib and mushroom & sauerkraut. We got them broiled. In addition, we got the goulash to share which came with mashed potatoes and a side of egg noodles (we chose the side). Food service was super quick - everything came out at once!  The periogis come with sour cream, applesauce and sauerkraut as dips. They're warm and the skin isn't too thin or mushy. Our favorite was the mushroom & sauerkraut. Sour cream was my preference, experimented with applesauce...which is tolerable if you're in for sweet and savory. The goulash paired well with the egg noddles under - meat was definitely tender and the sauce wasn't too thick. This place is open 24/7 and very convenient for the munchies after drinking to just casually with a big group of friends.",0
13383,"I saw Pig Heaven on TV at least 10 years ago during a special on the Travel Channel about ribs, just to give you some perspective on how long I've built up the anticipation to visit. I finally stopped in and I must say, this was not one of those situations where you build up excitement and get let down; what I had was probably one of if not the best Chinese food experiences I've ever had. We started off with meat fried dumplings and the vegetable spring rolls and were also brought out a variety of sauces to go with the apps. Both were extremely delicious. Next came the roast pork fried rice, not to be confused with regular pork fried rice. So many choices! This rice was simply done, not overly colored like a lot of places that put a ton of soy sauce or even yellow food coloring. It had the roast pork, onions, eggs and green peas. When I tell you it was beautifully flavored and seriously the best fried rice I've ever had. Then the RIBS!!! OMG THOSE RIBS! I need to pause for a moment from writing this review to compose myself, hold on. Ok, I'm back. These ribs...I have been dreaming about the ribs since I left Pig Heaven. Truly heavenly. If you have an opportunity to try this restaurant, you absolutely must. The end.",0
2457,"Tonii's, a modest establishment in the heart of Chinatown, offers delicious, made-to-order rice noodles and congee at astonishingly affordable prices, with each dish priced uniformly at $4. I decided to deviate from the classic beef noodles, trying the dry shrimp noodles instead. The shrimp, sun-dried into tiny umami-packed morsels, paired beautifully with the gummy white noodles, a unique departure from the usual translucent versions. The dish truly came to life after a generous addition of soy sauce and peanut sauce—a notable twist from the traditional sweet soy.

For a mere $1.50 extra, you can complement your meal with curry fish balls, which, while flavorful, aren't essential unless you arrive with a voracious appetite. The generous portions ensure you won't leave hungry.

Seating is limited and not ideal for solo diners due to the four-person table setup. Take note: peanut sauce is curiously available only at the order station, so be sure to grab some for your takeout or before you settle at your table. Despite this oddity, Tonii's delivers on flavor and value, making it a must-visit for noodle enthusiasts.",1
14766,"I recently visited a local pizzeria that has certainly raised the bar with its pizza offerings. While it may not claim the title of the best pizza I've ever enjoyed, its culinary execution is undeniably top-notch. My advice? Bypass the unremarkable margherita – you can find a classic New York slice anywhere – and dive straight into their pizza squares which pack a more flavorful punch.

The standout for me was the pepperoni pizza, a harmonious blend of a crispy-edged, chewy-centered crust, topped with a vibrant, slightly spicy tomato sauce, and perfectly complimented by savory rounds of pepperoni. It's an option that truly sings.

Even the plain cheese variant held its ground with a notably sweeter tomato sauce, albeit lacking the spice kick, proving to be a satisfying albeit less adventurous choice. In short, if you're looking for a dependable pizza experience with some standouts, this pizzeria is worth your consideration.",1
15306,"I loveeeee this place -- everything we ordered was absolutely phenomenal. The Chile relleno was sweet and savory with quinoa, raisins and nuts complimenting each other perfectly.

12582,"Title: Almost Perfect Dining, If You Can Bear the Wait

My evening at this culinary hot spot could have been a five-star experience if not for the excessive three-hour wait on a Thursday night, despite arriving early at 5:45 PM. Tip for prospective diners: take the host's estimated wait time, add an extra half-hour buffer, and then enjoy a nearby spot to relax before dining.

Once seated, the restaurant's offerings did not disappoint and truly lived up to their reputation. The Cacio is a must-try, the artichokes are divine, and I suggest leaning on staff recommendations for an assuredly delicious meal. In summary, brace yourself for the wait, but once you're dining, the flavors and experience are undoubtedly worth it.",1
19626,"Title: A Culinary Delight with Impeccable Service

I had a fantastic dining experience at this gem with two friends, and we were all spellbound by the quality of food and service. From the delectable family-sized fried calamari that admittedly was a bit too generous for the three of us, to the scrumptious tagliatelle carbonara that we couldn't stop savoring despite being full, this restaurant knows how to satisfy your taste buds.

The ambience struck the perfect balance of comfort and charm, contributing to an unforgettable evening. The staff deserves a special mention for their warm welcome, attentiveness, and remarkable ability to accommodate guests, ensuring a seamless dining experience.

I visited on a Tuesday night, finding it pleasantly lively without the overcrowding one might expect at peak times. Also, the convenience of making reservations via the Yelp app was a plus.

Overall, I wholeheartedly recommend this restaurant with a full score: 10/10. It's not just a place to eat; it's a venue to indulge in, and yes, a return visit is a must!",1
1517,"After hearing much buzz about Jaiya, I finally seized the chance to dine there. Although we encountered a short wait, the bar provided a pleasant spot to enjoy some Sangha beer—though the selection was limited with no draft options. Service at the bar was commendable.

Culinary speaking, the dumplings we started with were quite tasty. My main course, the Pad Thai, was satisfactory but lacked the robust flavors I anticipated—there's room for more zest and zing. Conversely, the Red Curry shone brightly with its savory goodness, and the Drunken Noodles at the neighboring table seemed tempting for a future visit.

We wrapped up with dessert, which was passable but not remarkable. Overall, Jaiya offers decent Thai fares paired with good service. While I might not make a special trip, it's a solid choice for those in the area.",1
12721,"Title: A Tale of Two Visits at the Lobster Shack

On my initial visit to this cozy spot, the experience was a solid 5 stars, especially with their Connecticut lobster roll – think warm, succulent lobster neatly tucked into a perfectly toasted bun, paired with a refreshing side of coleslaw and a tangy pickle. A surprising delight was the Friday night promo offering a complimentary bowl of their rich and hearty clam chowder, loaded with tender clams and potatoes, an offer communicated to us with enthusiasm.

However, my return visit fell short of the high bar set by the first. My anticipation for the lobster roll was dampened by the cashier's hesitation to disclose the chowder promo, which only came to light after my inquiry. And while the lobster roll remained a reliable favorite, the fried clams were a letdown. At $17, I was served what looked promising but turned out to be merely a cloak of batter with barely a hint of clam inside – a stark contrast to the generous chowder.

In summary, while the Connecticut lobster roll is still a winning choice, I suggest skipping the overpriced and underwhelming fried clams to avoid a culinary misstep.",1
14360,"Title: A Hearty Meal at Wah Fung - Worth the Hype!

I took a trip to Wah Fung recently to celebrate my friend's move to the Big Apple, and I now understand why this spot is famous. Despite not discovering it through the Fung bros as many have, the experience was just as exciting.

The buzz is real: Wah Fung delivers on taste and value. As foretold by countless reviews, the restaurant was bustling, and adhering to its cash-only, early closing tradition (around 7 PM), adds to its old-school charm. We arrived close to closing time and were lucky enough to grab a bite — a tip for newcomers, they often sell out by evening.

The small plate, reasonably priced at $4.25, was surprisingly filling. It included a succulent cut of pork, aromatic rice doused with pork drippings, and tender cabbage—a simple yet satisfying combination.

Despite nearing their closing time, a sizable line awaited service, testament to their popularity. While there's no seating inside, we found the nearby park to be the perfect spot to enjoy our takeout. And with a Kung Fu Tea just steps away, refreshments are conveniently at hand.

Wah Fung stands out as a must-visit for an authentic, affordable New York food experience. Make sure to bring cash and arrive early to beat the crowds!",1

Review:
Stepping into Balthazar whisked me away to the streets of Paris, turning my dismal day into a delightful dining experience. The ambiance marries chic with nostalgia, making any Francophile's heart sing. Despite having read critiques of tough steaks and lackluster service, my experience couldn't have strayed further from those claims.

The steak-frites were sublime – the steak cooked to perfection, and the béarnaise sauce was a revelation, so much so that I couldn't help but indulge in every single fry, despite the generous portion. Skepticism from past reviews was quickly forgotten as the attentive service shone through; it was as if the staff had anticipated our every need. The waitress’s considerate attention, especially given my gluten allergy and my fiancé's discomfort, set a new gold standard for service excellence.

Balthazar breathes authenticity into their steak-frites, a true rarity outside of France. It's not just a meal; it's an experience – one that is absolutely worth the cost. Balthazar, you've stolen my heart, and I am already looking forward to my next visit.",1
20079,"Being only a block away from where I was staying, my sister and I thought we could try it out. After a short walk in my he Indian Summer Night, we chose to sit outside. We were asked if we wanted water - sparkling or still. Poring over the menu, debating whether to go with the Prix Fixe menu or an entree, the. Taking forever to choose between lots of conversations - we never felt rushed or bothered by the waitstaff. The small plate charcuterie sampler was ordered to start, as well as a drink for my sister. Overall, the service was marvelous. Not intrusive nor interruptive but gracious and friendly. The charcuterie had coarse duck and fig pate, finer chicken liver pate, and a coarse duck with cognac pate, slices of salami, a dollop of rough milled mustard, French pickled vegetables, and half slices of rustic bread.  The duck and fig pate was less flavorful than the other two, which were quite good on their own. The surprise were the small sample of pickled vegetables - nice a crispy, salty and not vinegary at all. A good textural complement to the pates and salami. By the time we finished the charcuterie small plate, we were fuller than we anticipated!  So we ordered the pear salad with the walnuts and sunflower seeds. The dressing was perfect - light, a very slight tang, and not overpowering. The butter leaf and endive were quite fresh. The salad was enough after the heavier charcuterie. The waiter had remembered I'm lactose intolerant and served the blue cheese separately!  What attentiveness!After a bit more of chatting, we were ready for dessert - well, because the menus were given to us, and gosh, there's always room for dessert!  My sister chose the Fig Compote, and I chose the sorbet, a scoop of coconut, raspberry and dark chocolate. The sorbets were beautiful and bursting with their flavors!  The Fig Compote was amusing to see with the large white light disc of meringue and sugar covering the fig slices, sweet creamy cheese (marscapone?) and tiny scoop of honey vanilla ice cream. There was some powdered raspberry or some flavoring that my sister accidentally inhaled while taking a bite and sent her coughing. It was lovely to look at but too sweet and not that much fig. A bit disappointing.  Half star off for that. The bathrooms are quite clean and well designed. It was a bit confusing to return to the restaurant however as the bathroom is downstairs. The hallway is shared with the place next door - Baloud Sud (?), and walls look quite alike so it's easy to turn the wrong way, even with signs. Overall, a great dining experience. Wish I could just take off half a star.",0
2944,"Title: Great Spot for Game Nights and Beers

I met up with some friends here to catch the NBA draft and I must say, this place has a laid-back vibe perfect for sports enthusiasts. They offer a nice variety of beers and while their happy hour deals are average, a nifty bonus is a complimentary draft when you check in on Yelp. Contrary to other local bars, this one wasn't overcrowded on a bustling Thursday evening.

Service here deserves a shout-out; our waiter Hector was all about prompt service, warm interactions, and ace hot sauce suggestions. Food-wise, I nibbled on a pesto sandwich, which was decent though the chicken cutlet was a bit on the small side for the price. However, the addition of El Yucateco hot sauce gave a delightful kick to the meal, meshing well with the smooth flavors of avocado and mozzarella.

In a nutshell, it's a spot I'd recommend for happy hour or to watch a game. While there might be better places for a meal, the food here won't disappoint if you decide to stay put.",1
13309,"Friend and I came here for an early dinner. Luckily there was no wait but it was already more than half full. Both of us have wanted to try this place for a while due to its reputation for delivering authentic Szechuan (aka spicy) cuisine. Sadly, we left feeling underwhelmed.

Everything was really delicious and the service was fantastic! Our waiter even took a picture with us at the end, he was so friendly and took the time to explain the options and make recommendations. The price is definitely steep, but it's a quintessential New York experience.",0
1680,"Title: A Hearty Bowl of Pho with a Twist

I stopped by this cozy spot over a chilly weekend, craving the warmth of a hot bowl of pho, and I wasn't disappointed. The restaurant offers a classic Hanoi beef pho where you can mix and match beef cuts—I opted for a combination of brisket and oxtail. The portion was generous, especially the meat, which was a welcome surprise, although a few more noodles would have been ideal to balance out the leftovers.

Unlike traditional Vietnamese pho joints, this place doesn’t serve a side plate of fresh herbs and bean sprouts, which I found myself missing. The price point is a bit steep, especially when compared to budget-friendly Chinatown options, but the broth's rich flavor and pronounced spices like cinnamon justified the cost for me, though it might be overpowering for some.

I also sampled their Vietnamese coffee, which was robust and satisfactorily dark. Seating is limited to counter space that fills up fast, so timing is key. Service was quick and courteous, making the dining experience all the more enjoyable. Despite the minor points for improvement, I'm keen on returning to explore more of the menu.",1
14378,"Having noticed a slew of mixed reviews, my boyfriend and I ventured into this restaurant to form our own opinion. Fortunately, we were seated immediately in the early evening. My boyfriend chose the #2 spicy paitan with pork, while I couldn't resist the #4 miso with pork, given my love for miso. Regrettably, both soups disappointed us with their borderline gelatinous consistency and lackluster flavor. Despite this setback, the redeeming qualities were the noodles and toppings, which were quite enjoyable. Nevertheless, it's unlikely we'll return unless we opt for a different dish.",1
17033,"I recently took advantage of a $4 credit through the Allset app at Market Crates in the Herald Sq area, which yielded a total of $6 off my meal. I ordered a Wild Cajun Salmon Plate with brown rice, Roasted Broccoli, and Cucumber, Avocado & Tomato Salad for pickup at 1:45 pm. With the discount, my total was an affordable $8.14.

Upon arriving a bit early, the staff were accommodating despite my order not being ready, and promptly provided my meal after a quick check-in. However, when I got back to my office, I realized the sides were incorrect—I received sweet potato and grilled zucchini/squash instead.

While it wasn't the side dishes I chose, the quality of the food made up for the error. The salmon and rice were on point, and the meal was reminiscent of the wholesome fare from Dig Inn. The portion was generous, enough for two lunches, which is great for those conscious of portion sizes.

Although there was a mix-up, the meal's quality and the staff's friendliness mean I’d happily return for lunch when I'm in the area again.",1
17016,"Tucked away amidst the urban hustle of NYC, this gem offers a warm slice of southern hospitality that's hard to come by in the Big Apple. Upon entering, the staff's personal greetings and genuine interest added a charming touch distinct from the typical city dining experience.

The fried okra is a must-try, striking a delectably crunchy balance that could win over any skeptic of the vegetable—though it's far from a health food indulgence. The chicken wings, when paired with the homemade honey mustard, transform from routine to remarkable, and the generous portion of six wings is a pleasant bonus.

However, the shrimp and grits fell short of remarkable, coming across as average compared to the other offerings. While this spot may not dazzle with its culinary prowess, those yearning for a taste of heartfelt southern warmth in their New York moments will find solace here.",1
17694,"Title: A Delightful Treat at Balthazar

Upon my last visit to Soho, I had the pleasure of stepping into Balthazar, conveniently situated just off Broadway and Prince Street. The cafe's coffee was rich and robust – a perfect companion to their divine cheesecake. I treated myself to a mini cheesecake, an indulgence I felt compelled to try after witnessing another patron's enthusiasm for the dessert.

Although priced at $8, the cheesecake does justice to its cost, making it an ideal luxury gift. Presented in a snug, elegant box, it's not merely a dessert; it's a statement of sophistication. Balthazar also offers a dining experience in their main restaurant, which is sure to impress with its French cuisine – my absolute favorite.

Whether you're looking for a quick, decadent lunch or a full dining experience to charm visiting friends or family, Balthazar is a gem that promises to deliver satisfaction.",1

On the menu was the ""Mushroom Fixation,"" a gourmet pizza topped with fresh tomato sauce, sumptuous mozzarella, and a medley of roasted cremini, shiitake, and button mushrooms, all seasoned with aromatic thyme and rosemary. The final flourish—a drizzle of truffle oil—left me wanting more.

The ingredients were not only fresh but organic, a testament to the quality of the food served here. The experience was so enjoyable that I'm already planning a return visit to sample more of their pizza offerings.

The restaurant boasts a spacious dining area at the front, providing plenty of seating for guests. Meanwhile, the bustling pizza counter at the back promises more gastronomic delights waiting to be discovered. It's safe to say I'll be back soon to delve further into their menu.",1
11233,"Unfortunately not the best place for accommodating vegetarians or vegans. We came here on a friend's recommendation who went to one of their other locations and ordered the Mac n cheese burger but swapped out the beef patty with the chickpea patty. Usually this is not a problem as chefs try to be accommodating with dietary restrictions. When we asked for the vegetarian swap at this location, the waitress was very hesitant and said that the cook there most likely wouldn't do it. So instead, she put our order in as the black bean burger with a side of Mac n cheese. It was very disappointing to say the least. We're grateful that we got anything at all, but we were expecting something else. Service itself was slow. It took a while for us to get our drink orders in and 15 more minutes for the waitress to come back and take our food order. It seemed that there was only one waitress on a Wednesday night right before July 4.",0

Nestled in the heart of Kip's Bay, this charming wine and tapas spot is an absolute must-visit.

Each dish we sampled was delightful, from the creamy croquetas and the crisp tostada to the succulent ribs and smoky shishito peppers. However, the real standout was the broccoli smothered in goat cheese and a kick of sriracha – a delectable combination that took our taste buds by surprise. Simply put, if you're in the area, this spot's array of tapas can't be missed. Yum indeed!",1
10377,"**Review of Mediterranean Charm in Hell's Kitchen**

Ambiance and Location: Tucked away in the vibrant Hell's Kitchen, steps away from Broadway theaters, this quaint Mediterranean spot has charm. Reservation and Timing: Secure a 5pm dinner slot—right as they open—and expect to mingle outside for a bit if early.

Service: While the initial interaction was pleasant, our experience was marred by a ""stealth"" server who, lacking presence and warmth, disrupted an otherwise enjoyable meal with her abrupt manner and untimely wine retrieval.

Food: The Sicilian Grillo wine delighted, despite an uneven pour. The seafood sampler was a visual match to online snaps, featuring a standout seafood burger slider among tasty treats, though the overly salted scallops and bland sides (dry rice and flavorless hummus) left something to be desired. The tagine, however, was a citrus-spiced triumph.

Tip: Arrive with reservations in tow, and perhaps inquire about a server with a less surreptitious approach for an uninterrupted dining pleasure.",1

This cheese steak turned me into savage!! Blame them!! I just can't get enough of it. This is the best cheese steak I have ever tried!! Few months back when my boyfriend introduced me to cheese steak he was surprised that I have never tried this. Now we both keep running here. The best part was when I discovered that they deliver .  I love their onion rings. The manager or bar tender I don't know who he is but he is super fast and nice. Would always go.",0

They were out of quite a few of the meats and the nachos Texanos, but got 3 tacos for $3.50 each.The tacos I got were al pastor, lengua, and enchilada. Each were covered in green sauce and came with radishes and limes. These were good overall, but the pineapple in the al pastor was stellar.",0
360,"Title: A Hidden Gem for the Adventurous Foodie

If you're someone who judges a book by its cover, this may not be the spot for you. Tucked away, with an unassuming exterior that some might find off-putting, this hidden gem is a haven for those who cherish authentic mom-and-pop shops offering delectable meals without a hefty price tag.

The star of the show is the uncomplicated yet satisfying plate of chicken or pork served with rice and cabbage. At just $5 for a small serving, it's a steal in the city, especially when you factor in the flavors that punch well above their weight.

Don't be deterred by the often-present line snaking out the door—it moves briskly. The catch is the lack of seating, but with a charming park just across the street, al fresco dining adds to the experience.

For the food adventurer seeking great taste, generous portions, and a bargain, this spot is a must-visit. Be ready for a quick grab-and-go meal that promises to delight. Enjoy!",1

I know because i ordered the truffle stuff to be bougie on CNY.Pumpkin Cream Dessert Bun: Delicious. Must order! 2 deep fried pumpkin looking chewy buns w/ a salted egg cream or something inside. Sweet, but not overly sweet. Good great delicious!Salted Crab Tofu: Also good. You need white rice as a base. Mixing w/ fried rice will over power the rice. It's yummy.Szechuan Pineapple and chicken: I have a pen, I have an apple, Ungh i have pineapple and then put it in with nicely fried chicken and stir fry w/ szechuan peppers. Delicious. Not spicy, but great amount of that mah lah mouth tingle. 5/7 would order again.Pea Shoots: Always a good idea. A bit older shoots, but still good.Truffle Xiao Long Bao: Gimmick. The truffle flavor was an itty bitty titty specks on top of the bao. There was some flavor and it smelled nice, but definitely not sure if it's worth the price. It's probably not.Truffle fried rice: again a gimmick. specks of truffle that smelled nice. You might get some taste of it if you take a big spoon full of the flecks. The fried rice by itself is good. Very nicely fried and tasty, i would get it again w/o the truffle and the mark up for the truffle flecks.Match tea with salted cheese: Not worth it. Looks nice, but it's just matcha and salted cheese drink. Super expensive. Save your cash and go to a boba shop instead.",0

13782,"Title: A Mixed Experience at Pricey Corner

My visit to this corner gem of a restaurant left me with a bittersweet taste. Starting on a positive note, the Striped Bass Black Aguachile was undeniably fresh, but the heavy sauce might deter those with a lighter palate, particularly given its $25 price tag. The Chayote Squash Salad brought a burst of summer with its tasty flavors, yet it didn't deliver the lightness one would expect from its appearance.

The Maitake En Salsa Verde was a standout, showcasing mushrooms in both fried and boiled preparations which created a delightful mix of textures. However, the enjoyment was somewhat overshadowed by the $24 price, steep for a dish primarily composed of mushrooms and sauce.

Unfortunately, the service didn't do much to uplift the experience, as it lacked the warm, friendly touch I had hoped for. Overall, while the food itself was a hit, the combination of high prices and indifferent service makes it hard to wholeheartedly recommend this establishment.",1
14135,"Visited the restaurant for Sunday brunch and had a decent experience overall. Upon arrival, the crowd was manageable, but by the time we finished, a significant line had formed, indicating a popular spot. Service tended to lag, often found ourselves searching for our waitress.

The food was a mixed bag; the stand-out was the particularly tasty fries. The fried chicken sandwich featured a thinly pounded chicken with a pleasingly seasoned batter. French toast had a delightful crispness reminiscent of crème brûlée, but the heavy-handed fruit drizzle was a letdown. I prefer to customize the sweetness of my French toast; having the sauce on the side along with syrup would have been ideal.

Despite these points, my guest and I didn’t find the overall dining experience compelling enough to warrant a return visit, especially with other venues on our list.",1
16524,"Title: A Stellar Turnaround with Ample Portions and Accommodating Service

Review:
My latest visit to this restaurant in January 2020 was a revelation – the food has taken a quantum leap from just a year prior, boasting delicious flavors and generous portions. A party of 15, we experienced the rare joy of having separate checks without any hassle, a convenience that too many establishments overlook.

The standout was the Cobb salad – not only was it fresh and flavorful, but its size was so substantial that I had leftovers to enjoy later, packaged neatly by the restaurant for takeout. The blue cheese dressing was notably scrumptious, tempting me to return sooner rather than later for another round, and at $13.95, it felt like a steal.

My companions echoed my sentiments, praising their dishes from the Green Garden Grains Salad, ideal for vegans or the health-conscious, to the mouthwatering burgers and fries, and the decadent pancakes that were as fluffy and buttery as advertised.

It's commendable how well the food matched the menu photos, setting an accurate and appetizing expectation. However, my experience was slightly marred by the repeated overlook on my water request – a point that necessitated intervention from a fellow diner experienced in hospitality. This hiccup cost the restaurant a star in my review.

Despite this, the transformation of the food quality within a year is enough to entice me back. Curiosity about the change led to a phone inquiry, yielding no concrete answers, but whatever the reason, the result is palatable – very good food with very nice portion sizes. This diner has certainly won me over, and I'm already planning my next visit.",1
15048,"Ordered a double pepperoni pizza for pickup (for two people). It was $20 after tax and tip. When we got there you go all the way to the back. I got a phone call saying when it was ready, right on time. Maybe a few min early even. Pickup was a breeze. The pizza was much smaller than I thought and there were not enough pepperonis on it, I thought. I was wrong. This pizza is a masterpiece. It is so good, Neapolitan style. The dough, sauce, cheese, amount of pepperoni, spice level, and crust were perfect. No complaints. Worth it. I will get two pizzas next time. I took a photo but one slice was already being eaten before the photo. Couldn't wait.",0

Also the vibe is great, the service is good yet the price isn't that high. Would recommend this place for a date",0

My dining experience at FIELDTRIP was nothing short of remarkable. Inspired by Chef JJ Johnson's feature on WABC Channel 7, I ventured to this gem in Harlem. The warm reception by the delightful staff set the tone for a memorable visit.

Chef JJ himself served us with a smile, reflecting his dedication to the community throughout these challenging times. Each rice bowl was a revelation of flavor, clearly crafted with passion and presented to perfection. The accompanying yuca chips added a crunchy texture that paired beautifully.

FIELDTRIP isn't just a restaurant; it's a heartfelt expression of care for the community, and it shows in every aspect. Chef JJ’s team made us feel like we were part of their family, taking us on a global journey with each bite. I am eagerly looking forward to reliving this sensational service and culinary delight on my next visit.",1
14577,"My boyfriend was so sad that we were going to eat vegan food for lunch on Saturday, but that quickly changed after we tried their amazing food. This was our first time trying vegan sushi and it definitely did not disappoint!

17325,"Title: A Culinary Fiesta at La Cubana!

Prepare to be dazzled by both the ambiance and culinary prowess at La Cubana, where Chef Carl has truly outdone himself. From the moment you step in, the trendy bar and spacious dining area set the stage for a memorable experience. Each night, a live band infuses the place with an infectious energy that is matched by the staff's enthusiasm and thoughtfulness—they even serenaded our daughter with a birthday song!

Now onto the cuisine: Chef Carl's offerings are nothing short of exceptional. The empanadas are a must-try; both the beef and the spinach & cheese versions tantalize the taste buds with their perfect blend of flavors. The Pollo a la Plancha impressed with its juicy, tangy goodness, while the Chuleta Ahumada was a smoky delight.

However, it was the Carne con Papa, succulent short ribs that effortlessly fell apart under our forks, which stole the show. To top it off, dessert empanadas filled with fruit made for a flaky and sweet end to a truly remarkable meal. Hats off to Chef Carl and the team at La Cubana!",1
13376,"I recently dined at a charming restaurant that immediately won me over with its delightful ambiance and hospitable staff. The menu offerings were delectable, showcasing a culinary prowess that is sure to satisfy discerning palates. However, I couldn't help but note that the pricing felt steep considering the modest portion sizes, which left something to be desired for those with heartier appetites. Additionally, the dining area felt cramped, particularly during peak hours when the abundance of closely packed tables significantly limited personal space. Overall, while the dining experience was pleasurable in terms of service and taste, the value and comfort level could be improved to truly elevate the establishment.",1

However after a few minutes, the hostess moved us to a table that opened up. We ordered lemonade, pizza slice with house salad and vege sandwich from the lunch specials. They have great deals in the lunch special. The pizza was flavorful and delicious. As a thin crust fan, I was curious to try it out and wasn't disappointed. As far as ambiance, the restaurant gets very loud and I could barely be heard as we were seated right in between other tables of two and could hear their conversations. Price wise, it is very reasonable if you get their lunch specials.",0
16016,"""Bye"" Chloe was the reason I've never stepped foot in here before.

The whole story is so gross and typical nepotism and assault that I avoided the chain. Until tonight, when I saw my friend eating the pesto pasta and I decided to get it too. It was really good for a vegan pesto pasta and surprised me. If you're a fan of vegan food, get this dish. The sweet potato fries were tasteless. Won't be coming back, but glad to try it.",0
13973,"One the places I had on the bucket list was Ichiran because of the focus booth perfect for solo dining. This unique restaurant located in Midtown usually has a line out the door. However one rainy holiday weekday the line was there but not out the door so I finally step inside. Once inside there was another line and a server provided a piece of the menu where you can customize your own ramen. I came here with no expectations and chose their already set Classic Tonkotsu Ramen $18.50 plus they had a promotion of free extra noodles perfect for the winter cold. You get customize the firmness of the noodles and I was drawn to the matcha draft beer for $9. Once I finally entered I was assigned a focus booth, which has a section to pay when ready and payment is made at the front. In addition there a place where you can hang your coat and a self serve water hot or cold. Once I sat down, I already was served with the soup and condiments, which was very quick. The matcha draft beer came right after. Now to the food, the noodles were to die for and the broth with the condiments yum yum yum. The matcha draft beer was perfect to wash down the ramen and it complemented the dish really well. Price point you're definitely paying for the experience it is reminiscent of being in Japan. Definitely worth the splurge and would return one more time to try the vegetarian version of the ramen and the matcha pudding.",0
18504,This is based off a meal pal order.Came here for a chicken sandwich deal. The sandwich came with some really good homemade chips. You could tell they were legit and had a bbq seasoning. The chips were starting to get a little soggy from the coleslaw that leaked out of the sandwich.The sandwich itself was nice. The coleslaw was okay but the chicken itself was a giant portion and it had a nice Smokey flavor to it that I didn't expect. Definitely worth the meal pal price but I think this usually goes for $14. I'd say it's worth it. May need a little sauce if you aren't a fan of the existing flavor.,0
11766,"Title: Unimpressed by Style Over Substance

I visited this no-frills dining spot for the second time recently, hoping for a redemption from my initial lackluster experience, but I am compelled to express my disappointment. While the interior has a cool vibe and the menu boasts an extensive selection, that's where the excitement ends.

On my visits, I specifically tried the soup dumplings, which were passable, but not noteworthy when compared to other establishments. This time around, I ordered items Y1, Y3, and Y4. Unfortunately, the crab dish was too fishy to enjoy, and the dumplings fell short, both in size and value. At roughly $4-5 for a mere four dumplings that are smaller than what I've encountered elsewhere, it's not just the dumplings that are diminishing – it's also the appeal.

The portion sizes across the board are unsatisfying, especially when juxtaposed with the premium prices. Even the takeout experience was subpar; a hurriedly packed soy sauce disaster waiting to happen, which indeed it did, leaking all over the paper bag by the time I walked just two blocks home.

Service was efficient to the point of feeling rushed despite no queue, which might be seen as a plus in a busy city, but it felt impersonal. The presentation of the dishes was unremarkable, which might have been overlooked had the food been exceptional.

Regrettably, this restaurant seems to prioritize facade over culinary prowess. It's clear that I will not be returning for a third visit.",1
11721,"Title: A Brunch Worth Indulging In at Zengo

If you're on the hunt for a boozy weekend brunch spot, Zengo is your go-to destination. The value for money here is exceptional – prepare for an unlimited feast without an unreasonable price tag. The range of offerings is impressive, and it's hard to resist the urge to try it all, although the no-takeaway policy might make you mindful of leftover waste. But when the food is this good, you'll want to savor every bite on-site anyway.

Highlights from the menu include the fiery pleasure of the angry Zengo sushi roll, mouthwatering crispy potatoes, a zesty shrimp ceviche, and flavorful Thai chicken empanadas. The best part is the limitless reordering – if you fall in love with a dish, just ask for more.

Be sure to save room for dessert, as the chocolate waffles are a decadent treat not to be missed. Zengo is a place where indulgence is encouraged, and your palate will thank you for it. A word to the wise: come hungry to make the most of this bountiful brunch experience.",1
1280,"I recently dined at a local spot that touted its ""Hangover Cure"" as a specialty dish, only to discover it was merely a bowl of instant noodles. While I can appreciate the simplicity, the price tag was steep for something I could easily whip up at home for a fraction of the cost. Additionally, no beverages were included with the meal, which felt lacking in hospitality. Overall, the experience was underwhelming and felt overpriced for the offering.",1
13342,"Having dined at this establishment on three separate occasions, I can confidently say that your experience may vary based on the time of your visit. During dinner hours on weekends, expect a bustling atmosphere, yet impressively, the wait for a table is typically no more than five minutes. Conversely, lunchtime on Saturdays offers a more relaxed vibe, making it ideal for small group gatherings without feeling hurried.

The much-hyped fries live up to their reputation, particularly notable for the delicious sauce that accompanies them. However, the portion is generous to the point where sharing between three diners is sufficient. As for the ramen, the broth is commendably hearty yet avoids the pitfall of excessive saltiness.

Quick service and consistent food quality are two more feathers in this restaurant's cap. With these considerations in mind, I wholeheartedly recommend stopping by for a meal.",1
115,"My recent visit to this ramen spot was a delightful experience with zero complaints. The richness of the ramen broth stood out, perfectly balancing flavor and comfort in every spoonful. Accompanying our main course, the hand roll with salmon and avocado was a fresh, tasty treat, while the seaweed salad added a refreshing crunch. The star of the meal, however, was the beef ramen bowl - tender meat swimming in that remarkable broth made for a truly satisfying dish. Highly recommend for any ramen enthusiast looking for authentic and delicious options.",1
12231,"Title: Hidden Gem Near Penn Station

I stumbled upon a small restaurant on 37th Street, close to 8th Avenue, while browsing Yelp for nearby dining options. Its proximity to Penn Station was convenient, but the entrance was a challenge to spot as it's nestled within a loading dock. First-time visitors should keep their eyes peeled for the address when searching for this place.

Once inside, the setup is straightforward: order at the counter, then grab a seat by the counter or at a nearby makeshift table. I opted for the beef stew with yellow rice and salad. The food was flavorful, and for $8, the quality was on point. However, portions felt modest—leaving room for just a bit more to make it the perfect meal deal.

For anyone looking for a quick and tasty bite that won't break the bank, this spot is definitely worth the initial hide-and-seek.",1
12199,"Title: A Delightful Find Near the Met - Grazie

My companion and I ventured into Grazie for a late lunch this past Friday, having been enticed both by its convenient proximity to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and an appealing menu. Despite it being a bustling afternoon with a diverse mix of patrons, the atmosphere at this Italian gem was welcoming.

Before we even placed our orders, we were greeted with fresh bread accompanied by olive oil and a delectable sun-dried tomato paste—a promising start. For an appetizer, we shared the Buffalo mozzarella with tomatoes and balsamic. At $20, it was an inviting dish perfect for two.

Our main course was the Orecchiette Lambordia, which came in at $26. This pasta dish boasted a harmonious mix of sausage, spinach, fresh mozzarella, and tomatoes. It was so exquisite that we requested extra bread to savor every last drop of the sauce, leaving our plates gleaming.

Despite the premium prices, likely reflective of the location, the quality of food and the satisfaction it brought made it well worth the expense. Grazie provided an impressive dining experience that easily earns a 4-star rating. If you find yourself near the Met with a craving for Italian, Grazie is a spot you shouldn't overlook.",1
3034,"Title: A Night Owl's Haven for Comfort Food

If you're ever wandering the streets post-midnight on a weekend, craving some grub to soak up the evening's escapades, this joint is a beacon of hope. Open late on Friday and Saturday nights, it's the perfect spot for me and my squad to refuel after a night out.

The no card minimum policy is the cherry on top. Nothing's worse than fumbling with payment methods when you're tipsy and eager to eat. Here, the transaction is as smooth as the service, especially when all you want is to dig into some delicious food sans hassle.

It's also a social hub for the nocturnally inclined. Looking to extend the night's revelries? You're bound to meet a fellow patron in the same boat, ready to keep the party going.

In my enthusiastic, albeit inebriated state, I must have gushed a bit much, but the sentiment stands — this spot gets a big, tipsy thumbs-up from me. Love you guys, and thank you for serving the after-hours crowd with such grace!",1

The ambiance offers a welcome sense of privacy not often found in similar establishments. Securing a table was surprisingly easy, even at the last minute—an uncommon advantage in this bustling area.

The lunch menu is both enticing and reasonably priced. The standout for me was the Cajun rubbed rib eye — a flavorful delight. In addition, they boast a commendable wine selection that pairs perfectly with the meal.

Service at this venue is commendable for its consistency, ensuring a smooth and pleasant dining experience every time. Highly recommended for a midday business meal that won't disappoint.",1
20650,"Another decent AYCE hotpot place that won't break the bank! Recommend making a reservation, or coming before 6pm on weekends during dinner time unless you want to wait an hour. Dinner price for all you can eat is a mere $22.99 which, honestly, isn't bad at all for New York City. They have a pretty good selection of meats, fish balls, and veggies. You can order hot food too! The only thing that dissapointed me was how flavorless the broth was (I ordered the kimchi broth), but I guess that's where the sauce bar comes in handy.  Portions were on the bigger side, so I recommend ordering less to begin with. You can always order more as you eat! They also offer korean BBQ in addition to hotpot (or BBQ alone) for an upcharge. Come within 3 days of your birthday for a free ACYE meal (with a party of 4 or more).",0
10179,"I'm about a week out from having actually dined at Mimmo  Cucina Italiana. I had to double back and write this review. Mimmo is a nice sizes restaurant with a full bar on one side and a chic dining area on the other. The place is bright with lots of art on the walls. When you walk in, don't be confused because the seating area is up past the bar. Mimmo also has a visible brick oven  just beyond the dinning area. I will say, when we arrived, the restaurant had that fresh brick oven smell but it quick dissipated by the time we were served our first round of bellinis. I say that to say, if you get here when they first open as we did, be prepared for that. My friend and I enjoyed the bottomless brunch but we also had the opportunity to order other menu items as well. I had an Italian style omelette with the most amazing sausage and my friend had the steak sandwich. Everything was served hot and delicious. The service we received was stupendous.

18400,"I really love this place. I've been here twice now and think that the broth is the best out of the hot pot places that I've been to. I've gotten spicy tomato both times but my friends enjoyed their broths as well. I'm vegetarian and appreciate the vegetarian options but would like to see more noodle variety.Zhen Wei Fang can be a bit pricey since it isn't AYCE and the items add up quickly. I think that the food is higher quality and the presentation is super unique. I like that they have individual broths with the pot covers that prevent you from burning yourself. I also like how just generally aesthetic everything is.The service is also really good. The first time that we came, we asked for this plum juice that the servers said they didn't have. At the end of the meal, they ended up finding the plum juice and giving us several free ones (although they're $5 each on the menu) which we thought was very generous of them.I would definitely recommend you check this place out if you like hot pot!",0
11151,"Title: A Hit-and-Miss Breakfast Experience at Friedman's

Having frequented Friedman's on several occasions for breakfast or brunch, I've come to expect the tasty fare that it usually serves. Despite the snug setting and its popularity leading to long waits, their digital waitlist tool is a silver lining that smartly manages the crowd and makes the wait bearable.

Past visits had set a high bar with delightful dishes such as the blueberry pancakes and pastrami hash, both of which I savored. Nevertheless, my latest experience fell short of expectations. The Lemon Ricotta Pancakes, a special on the menu, promised much but delivered little. Unlike the consistently satisfying blueberry pancakes, the special was a letdown – the pancakes were surprisingly dry and lacked the anticipated lemon zing, which only came through with the candied lemon rind toppings.

Meanwhile, the Mushroom Toast ordered by my wife was the star of the morning, both visually and taste-wise, leaving me with a touch of food envy.

Despite this underwhelming pancake performance, my affection for Friedman's hasn't waned. It's clear to me that their strengths lie in their hashes and toasts, which I plan to stick to during future visits.",1

2551,"Title: A Carnivore's Delight With Service That Shines

If you're hunting for a dining experience that couples remarkable service with a meat lover's dream, look no further. My recent visit to this establishment was a standout, mainly due to the incredibly attentive and informative staff. There wasn't a moment where I felt the need to flag someone down— a testament to their commitment to customer care.

Opting for the pre-set course menus is a wise choice for those seeking value. My adventure began with a perfectly standard Miso Soup and a wise upgrade to Garlic Rice. The Gyu-Kaku Salad, dressed in a refreshing citrus and ginger, was a delightful next step, perfectly complemented by a generous portion of Edamame and a Japanese Chicken Karaage that was a nostalgic nod to Chicken with Pesto.

As for the BBQ items, it's hard to pick a favorite. The Premium Sirloin was sensational, the Yaki-Shabu Beef with Miso was so exquisite I ordered seconds, and the Umakara Ribeye with Garlic Shio Cabbage lived up to the ""fat equals flavor"" adage. Even the New York Steak, although just okay compared to the rest, was very satisfying, and the Toro Beef's thin slices were perfect for soaking up the sweet soy tare.

We wrapped up with a playful round of Smores, bringing a delightful end to a fulfilling meal. Though my dining companion chose a few other items that I wasn't familiar with, each was as delicious as the last.

Verdict: Don't just walk, run to this spot for your next carnivorous outing and prepare to be wowed by both the food and the top-notch service. Ready for my next culinary quest, I bid this meat haven farewell, but not for long.",1

Review:
Stepping into Simply BOMB was a decision that our taste buds will thank us for, indefinitely. We dove straight into the highly praised Bee Sting (large) and a classic Margherita (small), and neither disappointed. These pizzas have set a new benchmark - flavors so well-crafted that reaching for additional seasoning was unnecessary. Each slice stood out with its own perfect blend of ingredients that spoke volumes of the care put into them. The place lives up to its reputation, effortlessly. Count on us being repeat customers - Simply BOMB has truly earned our future visits.",1
1990,"Ok, second visit won me over. This time, we got kimchi, scallops (special), shrimp buns, stuffed dip with spicy pork, roasted carrots, and spicy beef ramen, all of which was excellent. The kimchi is great and a pretty good portion. The scallops probably wouldn't be a must re-order if they had them next time we went, but they were very good. The shrimp buns are as outstanding as always, and the stuffed dip was incredible. We also loved the roasted carrots, and the ramen was excellent -- much more flavorful than the ones we had on our first visit, and one of the better ones you'll find in the city, in my opinion.",0
15685,"Title: A Hidden Gem Amongst the Chaos

Getting to this tucked-away eatery proved an adventure, with protests clogging 5th Avenue and necessitating a 10-block dash that had us arriving, breathlessly punctual, to claim our reservation. But any frustration faded quickly as we stepped into a space that exuded the authentic, unpretentious charm of Asian cuisine, miles apart from the typical over-Americanized fusion joints.

The welcome surprise of a free shot of orange liquor from Yelp checked us in on a high note. We settled into mildly uncomfortable chairs and perused an enticing menu, our eyes drawn to the promise of hot pots, raw seafood, and an array of tapas – a foodie's dream for sampling diversity.

Dumplings arrived first, setting a high bar with their impeccable balance of crispy exterior and flavorsome filling. Chili shrimp, fried tempura-style, brought a delightful heat, while the honey-glazed chicken wings, begging to be bottled, continued the trend of spicy satisfaction.

Bao, a newfound love, did not disappoint. The fried chicken variety triumphed with its crunchy-soft duality over the satisfactory pork buns. The Spicy pork main—a personal favorite—struck a harmonious chord in the mild-to-medium spice range, the meat cooked to perfection.

Defying expectations, the dessert menu offered an array of Western delights. Our choice of churros, served with ice cream, was a revelatory finale—crispy, sugary, and surprisingly at home in this Asian enclave.

A serendipitous Yelp discovery, this place is a must-visit for anyone seeking a culinary adventure in NYC. The memorable meal ensures that any local—or traveler lucky enough to stumble upon it—will leave with plans to return.",1
20944,"It was raining and there was a lot of chaos going on for SantaCon so after some walking we were able to escape all the Santa's and stumbled upon Coco & Cru for a quick drink.  It's a small little restaurant with a small bar.  There's a lounge/bar downstairs as well.  The service was great, our bartender was very nice and friendly.",0
17017,"Title: Pleasant Surprise with Mixed Feelings

My dining experience by a serene window seat at this establishment during restaurant week offered a delightful ambiance contrasted by the odd choice of a television broadcasting breaking news. The silence and calm were unexpectedly paired with the world's latest crises, an interesting juxtaposition to say the least.

The portions were generous, affirming the restaurant's participation in the week's festivities. Service was impeccable—our waiter exuded friendliness, and our busboy's attentiveness ensured our glasses were never empty, creating a warm, homely feeling.

Price-wise, the restaurant week menu was reasonable. The pasta dish was a visual treat, indicating a commendable attention to presentation. However, the short rib's over-salted flavor was a letdown and somewhat marred the culinary experience. Conversely, the eggplant parmigiana sampled from my companion's plate was superbly crafted—each bite sang with well-balanced flavors.

Our meal concluded on a high note with the standout dessert—cream puffs dipped in chocolate. These treats left an indelible impression, their sweet memory lingering pleasantly.

Despite the exceptional service and some culinary highs, the mixed feelings about the food's seasoning and the intrusive TV news make me hesitant to return.",1
17625,"I had high hopes for this much-anticipated visit, but alas, it was a letdown. The long wait due to minimal staffing started the experience on a sour note. We tried a variety of items—the ""Regs"" with Nacho Queso sauce, Buffalo Nuggets with ""OG ranch,"" Mozz Nuggs with marinara, and Crispy AF fries. Disappointingly, only the fries lived up to their name in temperature. The nuggets fell flat in flavor, and the overall meal wasn't worth the nearly $30 spent. This spot feels more like a marketing gimmick than a culinary destination. My advice? Save your money and skip the hype, as this experience is likely to disappoint.",1
13652,"I recently dined at this upscale tavern with a friend for lunch and drinks, and it delivered a fine dining experience that stands out from your average casual spot. The portion sizes are on the smaller side, but the exceptional quality of the food justifies this; the lobster ravioli, scallops, and salmon were all exquisite. Service was impeccable, as was the extensive wine list, which complemented the meal beautifully. The decor added to the high-end atmosphere, making it a superb choice for anyone looking for a refined tavern experience.",1

20086,"We arrived here on a Thursday at 7pm without a reservation (for 2 people). They were able to accommodate us right away but any later and we would have had a wait as the restaurant was packed when we left. Decor was definitely Thailand but more like fancy hotel Thailand, not the street stall restaurant. Service was superb.We had the soft shell crab mango salad to start which was excellent. I had the massaman curry with mock duck. The curry was flavorful and sweet, potatoes melt in your mouth. However, I should have passed on the mock duck for a different protein.Husband had the khao soi which he was excited to see this authentic Thai dish on the menu. Lived up to expectations!",0
18013,"Title: Unforgettable Noodle Rolls – A Must-Visit Spot!

I've found my new addiction – the rice noodle rolls at this gem of a spot are simply the best I've ever had. With the option to customize fillings and add-ins like a must-try special egg that enriches the flavors, each bite is a revelation. I indulged in the roast pork with egg, topped with delectable fish balls, and the quality just blew me away – incredibly soft, supremely fresh noodle rolls that are a cut above the rest.

Even their curry fish balls were memorable on their own. Be warned, though – its popularity is no secret, evidenced by the mid-afternoon queue on a Tuesday. And if a daily patron in his 90s swears by it, you know it's something extraordinary. Don't hesitate – it's worth every moment of the wait. Hurry over!",1
304,"Title: Serene Sips at STK's Cocktail Lounge

My recent visit to STK’s cocktail lounge was a delightful experience, one that I'd heartily recommend for those seeking a tranquil ambiance coupled with top-notch drinks. Arriving on a Saturday afternoon at 4:30 PM, I found the setting serene, perfect for my preference for quieter environments.

The lounge boasts an Instagrammable wall, and we were fortunate to snatch prime seating facing this trendy spot. Adorned with umbrellas and fans, the area offered a cozy retreat, although the 90-degree weather did make it rather warm.

Turning to the drinks, the cocktails, albeit on the pricier side at $19 each, were sumptuous. I indulged in a strawberry cocktail garnished with what seemed like crushed graham crackers—a delightful touch that added to the drink's allure. Meanwhile, my boyfriend's similar choice was equally refreshing.

We later opted for two bottles of Rosé, priced at $75 each, which yielded about six glasses per bottle—a sensible choice over individual glasses. Although STK leans toward the expensive, the investment in their cocktails can be justified by their quality.

In closing, if you're looking for a chic and mellow spot to enjoy some expertly crafted cocktails, STK's lounge should be at the top of your list. The atmosphere is inviting, the service attentive, and the drinks a palate-pleasing adventure.",1
13661,"Title: A Fiery Yet Satisfying Hot Pot Experience

I recently visited a local hot pot restaurant on the recommendation of a friend and had a memorable dining experience. First off, a word of caution to fellow diners: avoid my mistake of sipping directly from the hot pot – a quick route to a burnt tongue! Pro tip: use the provided bowls at the sauce station to let your soup cool.

I opted for a personal hot pot with Tom yum soup base, rich with flavor, and filled it with an assortment of tofu, mushrooms, crab, shrimp, and watercress. The ingredients were notably fresh and cooked perfectly in the deliciously tangy soup. Throughout the meal, the attentive staff ensured my pot stayed full with chicken broth, maintaining the warmth and flavors.

Despite the initial scald, the overall experience was exceptional, enhanced by the restaurant's clean and modern setup. The all-you-can-eat offer at $29.95 per person is well worth it, considering you can indulge in a variety of fresh ingredients.

However, the true highlight was their coconut taro soup dessert — a bowl of heaven with sweet tapioca that had me going back for seconds. It was so good I could eat it every day, and I hope they consider offering it as a to-go option. 

In summary, despite the minor mishap, the food was fantastic, the atmosphere was top-notch, and I would certainly recommend this place to any hot pot enthusiasts out there.",1
14981,"Title: Ideal Spot for Group Lunches with a Minor Misstep

I recently dined at this venue for a work lunch with a large party of 20, and my experience was largely positive. The restaurant efficiently accommodates big groups, as evidenced by the ease of making a reservation, and the staff took great care in ensuring our needs were met promptly.

Their lunch offerings are particular highlights - with a choice between a 2-course ($18.95) and 3-course ($24.95) meal that includes soda, hot tea, and coffee, providing flexibility and value. The portions were satisfactory, and the option to decide on dessert at the meal's end is a thoughtful touch.

However, I must note that there was a slight hiccup – all water glasses had impurities floating in them, which was off-putting. Additionally, it was disappointing to learn that iced tea was not part of the included beverage options with the lunch prix fixe.

Overall, the restaurant is recommendable for those looking to host a large lunch gathering, as long as one keeps an eye on the water quality and beverage options. Despite the minor issues, the establishment merits four stars for its service, menu structure, and group accommodation prowess.",1
16954,"I got the Humble Fish n Chip and the fish was really nice and fresh! However, the portion was quite small and I was still hungry after. They also put a little too much dressing but it wasn't too bad. Next time I'll get it with rice or something.Service here was really nice and sweet.",0
12672,"Title: A Local Gem Delivered Right to Your Door

I've become quite the aficionado of this local pizzeria's fare, despite never setting foot in the establishment. Their delivery service is top-notch, with each pie arriving piping hot and bursting with flavor. They've mastered the delicate balance of sauce, cheese, and toppings, ensuring each bite is a gastronomic delight. While the crust deviates from the traditional thin New York style—trending towards the thicker side—it's a minor detail in what is otherwise an exceptional pizza experience. From the classic cheese to the fully-loaded pepperoni/sausage pie, the quality ingredients shine through. I heartily recommend giving them a try for anyone in the vicinity. You won't be disappointed.",1
15125,"I love Hot Pot. Shabu Shabu is my jam and I've pretty much been obsessed with soup all of my life. No matter the weather, I can be seen eating soup! This restaurant has multiple locations so pick your spot. When you walk in it's warm and inviting, sometimes extremely busy so I recommend making a reservation on Yelp or calling ahead. Yelp only offers an option to make a reservation for 4 or more. If you're under that just call ahead. They actually gave me a reservation and tied it to a 2 hour window. So whether you come a few minutes late or you're right on time, you have a time slot to work with. I love this place because I was lucky enough to get a pulsd deal which included hot pot with unlimited options (for 2 ppl) and 2 drinks. We had the Sapparo beer. The meat is super fresh and delicious. Be careful, if you choose the pork, it's well seasoned but takes much longer to cook. The other meat are thin and cook fast. They have an array of amazing fresh veggies, delicious seafood, and a variety of broths and condiments. Before you leave make sure to check in and get your complimentary scoop of ice cream on your way out.Check me out @saltandsavor on IG",0
18076,"Came here to try their famous milkshakes. We went in around 6:30pm on a Friday night and were told there is a 2 hour wait, so we left our number and went down the block to Taco Bell to wait. Within 15 minutes we got a table. The table space is pretty tight, which is understandable since it is Manhattan. Just be aware. The food wasn't great. They were out of the churro milkshake that I wanted to try. We got cookies and cream instead. I'm giving this 3 stars because going from a ""2 hour wait"" to a 15 minute wait is a lot. There should be a system to better estimate wait times. The bathroom looked cool and was clean. The music is very loud in the restaurant, so if you're looming for somewhere to sit down to chat and catch up with people, I don't recommend this spot. If you're looming for an over the top dessert for a birthday, come here for their milkshakes.",0
16303,"Been wanting to try this place for awhile. Seen this highlighted on Insider Food and Mikey Chen. Both my friend and I got the dipping ramen. We came around 6pm on a Wednesday night and didn't experience a wait. Although we had an issue with the bill/CC payment, the staff and owners were amazingly kind. I loved how polite and attention to detail they were. My biggest criticism of the food is that its REALLY salty. I've had dipping ramen before and the broth is usually a bit thicker and creamier. This one was heavy with garlic and a bit too watery to be considered perfect for dipping thick ramen noodles into. Again it is REALLY REALLY salty. The bean sprouts at the bottom were too salty to finish.",0

16715,"This is one of my favorite restaurants I've tried in a while. I came with my boyfriend and we shared dishes, but this definitely would be a good place to bring more people too to try a greater variety of dishes. We made a reservation for 6pm on a Friday and were walked to our table pretty quickly. You can tell they put a lot of work into the decor of this place. Even the bathroom had nice soap which I tried to find the brand of but I suspect it may be Aesop soap (it just said Wayan on the bottle). Chicken skewers - really tender chicken and the peanut sauce was amazing. After the chicken was gone I was still scraping the plate to finish the sauceLobster noodles - this was my favorite dish. The noodles remind me of ramen noodles, but the sauce on it was amazing and they are pretty generous with the juicy lobster pieces in it.

It has a mild spicy flavor but it didn't really stand out to me like the chicken skewers and lobster noodles didPandan custard dessert - great dessert to share and pretty unique. I liked the balance of sweet and sour and the passionfruit seeds on top added a bit of a crunchOverall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant for a nice dinner date or night out with friends.

The mushroom appetizer didn't look like much when it came out, but it was actually quite good! The seasoning of the mushrooms were great.I was skeptical about the spaghetti limone because it just looks so simple, but since all the reviews recommended it I had to try it. It is very simple in the taste, but it's very delicious! Quite addicting to eat actually. The tagliatelle bolognese was a good dish to get to contrast the flavors of the spaghetti limone. We also got a side of butternut squash, but it was really 80% cheese, 20% veggie. Great spot for a Sunday dinner or when you just want to have some comfort food.",0
18097,"Title: Decent Diner Experience with Room for Improvement

After much deliberation, I've settled on a three-star rating for this Upper East Side diner. The ambiance was charming and the service provided by our server was top-notch – friendly, attentive, and hospitable. However, the food didn't quite hit the mark.

I opted for the classic 'Two Eggs Any Style' with bacon on the side, accompanied by home fries and toast. Admittedly, I was taken aback by the prices, but that seems par for the course in this upscale neighborhood. My scrambled eggs were satisfactory; it's a dish hard to mess up. But the bacon was a letdown; it was cold and tough, reminiscent of jerky rather than the fresh, crispy bacon I crave.

The rapid arrival of my meal suggests pre-prepared elements rather than freshly cooked. On a positive note, the portion size was generous, especially the bacon, and the home fries were fairly decent. Nothing, however, was served at an impressively hot temperature.

Given the diner's location and prices which suggest a premium experience, I anticipated a meal that would be great rather than just passable. In the future, I hope they'll align the quality of their dishes with the expectations set by their pricing.",1
18285,"Tucked away in the vibrant heart of SoHo, this pizza spot delivers a solid culinary experience for enthusiasts of the classic Italian dish. The ambiance does come with a price tag, which seems to reflect in the cost, but it's an atmosphere worth soaking in for a special occasion. Among their offerings, the clam pizza stood out as a must-try, with each bite brimming with flavor. The funghi and margherita were also delightful, rounding out a satisfying trio of choices. Whether you're a local or just passing through, this establishment is worth a visit for anyone in search of an elevated pizza experience.",1
11623,"Dumplings are ok here, I've had better. However, I come by religiously for their sesame pancake sandwiches. Very unique food item you can't really find anywhere else. It's a cross between a regular sesame pancake and a banh mi (viet sandwiches) - pure genius.I usually get the roast pork sesame pancake sandwich ($3.75). It's stuffed with the roast pork as well as pickled carrots and cilantro. Although the prices have risen over the years, it's still considered cheap and still so good. Only complaint is that the consistency of the pancake itself fluctuates - sometimes it's fresher (warmer, crispier) than other times (slightly soggier). I like to add sriracha to it or even vinegar. Also already amazing the way it is. It's always busy in here so be prepared for a little bit of a wait - whether it's for a table or just take out. I remember ordering the cold noodles with sesame sauce one time which was delicious but I had to wait QUITE a while for it... Noodles take probably the longest out of everything on their menu. It does ensure freshness though, since you can see them making it right after you order.",0
19166,I've been here twice in two weeks for lunch meetings and it's a perfect spot for that. Not too crowded during this time which is ideal. The eggs over rosti and mozzarella sandwich are both delicious and service was fast. It's a little bit on the pricey side but the portions are pretty large.,0
16412,"Title: Mixed Feelings on Happy Hour at The Social Spot

I recently checked out the happy hour at The Social Spot, which runs daily from 4pm to 7pm. The cocktail options are a bit limited, but I did enjoy the tamarind margarita priced at $8 – it had a unique twist and was quite tasty. Following that, I tried the cucumber gimlet, also $8, which was merely passable; refreshing but nothing to write home about.

When it came to their happy hour food menu, nothing really stood out to me, and the prices didn't encourage a trial. There's a vibrant atmosphere in the main area with ample bar seating, plenty of TVs for sports enthusiasts, and enough standing room for a lively crowd.

For those seeking a more subdued setting, there's a quieter section with tables towards the back. True to its name, The Social Spot seems like a suitable place to mingle and unwind after work, although the happy hour offerings could use a bit more variety and value.",1
13149,"Just Salad in TriBeCa offers a versatile menu well-suited for both meat enthusiasts and vegetarians alike. Their BYOB (bring your own bowl) policy encourages eco-friendliness, provided you purchase their branded reusable bowl—kudos for promoting environmental consciousness.

The assembly-line setup allows for customizable salad creations alongside preset menu options, with a range of flavors from spicy to mild. During my visit, I savored the chicken poblano salad; the switch to grilled chicken from crispy was seamless and complimentary, enhancing the already flavorful dish, thanks in large part to the standout poblano dressing.

However, the efficiency-driven service can feel impersonal—staff members, focused on speed, may overlook customer interactions. This detracts from the experience, especially if you're looking to tweak your order on the spot.

While prices reflect the TriBeCa locale, averaging around $12 a salad, Just Salad's concept of fresh, tailored meals adds value. Yet, the bustling environment isn't conducive to exceptional service, which might give some patrons pause.",1

There was enough sauce for extra noodle (Kaedama) if you wanted more ($2 for 1/2 portion). It has two pieces of char siu, bamboo shoots, wood ear, corn and scallions. My hubby had the toro niko tonkotsu ramen. The broth was very smoky-he enjoyed it, I did not. The appetizer menu is quite limited and expensive $7 for a tiny amount of Kim chee! We did not partake.

1406,"Title: A Cozy Spot with Friendly Vibes and Tasty Bites

I recently visited a spacious restaurant with friends for an early dinner and was charmed by its decor and vastness, including a variety of seating options and a bar area that beckons for a later visit. The staff was notably amiable and eager to ensure a pleasant dining experience.

Though the regular menu items are on the pricier side, reflecting typical Manhattan costs, the lunch special is a steal at $22 for an appetizer and an entree. Our table shared unconventional yet scrumptious avocado fries and a flavorful carrot hummus with pita, both of which I'd recommend.

For the main course, the Pad Thai was the star, and while it may not surpass the authenticity of traditional Thai haunts, it was undeniably delightful. Whether you opt for chicken or shrimp, it's a satisfying choice.

In short, for a lovely atmosphere, friendly service, and enjoyable food, this spot is highly recommended, especially for their lunch specials.",1
12365,"My recent visit to Hop Shing in the heart of Chinatown came with its own set of pros and cons. Kicking off the day, I appreciated that the restaurant opens early and offers takeout, perfect for those morning dim sum cravings.

However, my experience was slightly marred by a significant language barrier, which seems to be a staple in this part of town. Service began with a lengthy 20-minute wait just to catch an employee's attention for seating, followed by another stretch of time before we could flag down a server to take our order. Communication was minimal – a nod for a question, and an unassuming return with water when we were ready to order.

Surprisingly, though our waitress didn't write anything down, our order arrived almost instantly, missing only a few items. The dim sum itself was flavorful but noticeably oilier than what I've had elsewhere. I also found the rice noodle rolls underwhelmingly small and scantily filled compared to other establishments. 

Patrons should not expect cleanliness or opulence here; it's all about the food. And maybe keep some antacids handy – this meal required some afterwards attention for the stomach. Despite the service hiccups and the need for indigestion remedies, the taste of the dim sum does beckon a return visit.",1
17684,Stumbled in here on a busy Saturday night and was happy to be able to get a table.  The atmosphere is cozy and its just the perfect spot to hunker down on a cool night with a drink and some comfort food.  The menu had a lot of pub offerings but I really wanted a burger.  The burger was cooked to order and had a generous portion of fries with it.  The fries were perfect - crispy and delicious.  I added sauteed mushrooms and they were cooked well but lacked flavor.  Could have used some garlic and salt or something.  The whole burger was pretty bland.  But it was nothing a little onion and ketchup couldn't fix.  The quality was great for sure.  I'd come again for the atmosphere and maybe try something else off of the menu!,0

The pizza boasts a flawlessly crispy bottom with just the right amount of thin, cheesy goodness – a testament to the unique qualities of NYC water in the dough, something that's truly missed on the west coast. My go-to is always cheese, but a mix-up led me to try their pepperoni and a hot honey slice; honestly, I wasn't disappointed – both were delicious AF. The ambiance is comfortably clean, ideal for enjoying a straight-up slice of pizza paired with a refreshing soda. Highly recommend a visit for that real-deal NYC slice!",1
11959,"Title: A Victorian Oasis Near Times Square

In a serendipitous Yelp discovery, my co-worker and I stumbled upon this unique Victorian-themed gem, just a stone's throw from the pulsing heart of Times Square. Skepticism turned to satisfaction once we tasted what this place had to offer.

The décor may verge on the kitschy side of Victorian, but it adds a novel twist to the dining experience in such a bustling part of town. It's the food, though, where this eatery truly shines. We each indulged in the Lillie's cheeseburger - a hefty half-pound creation cooked to perfection, encased in a substantial bun that barely contained the juicy, cheesy delight within.

A mix-up initially landed a portion of fries on my plate instead of the side salad I ordered. However, the attentive service shone through as the error was quickly remedied, allowing me to sample both. While the fries were decent, the mixed greens salad was a refreshing complement to the meal. The burger was undoubtedly the star of the show.

It's worth noting that the towering table height may challenge comfort levels, and the space is not the most sprawling. Still, for those seeking an unexpected culinary break from the norm in Times Square, this restaurant is definitely worth a visit.",1
12767,I came here with friends brunch. The brunch menu is really small. All the food was delicious but the prices were a bit high I think for the amount of food you get (it's tapas so small portion but it adds up! With drinks we paid about $54 each.),0
15282,"Title: A Tale of Two Visits: Pho-nomenal Start But Lost Momentum

My mission to provide balanced reviews brought me to this establishment twice, leading to a contrasting experience. Initially, the pho was a triumph of flavor: a rich broth, perfectly tender meat, and fresh noodles hit the mark, complemented by hot and fresh calamari.

Regrettably, the second visit didn't match up. The pho suffered from a tepid temperature and meat that oddly straddled the line between raw and overdone. The appetizer mix-up delivered a meat-filled roll instead of the expected veggie spring rolls, and though palatable, it wasn't what we anticipated.

Communication barriers may have played a part, but as a non-confrontational diner, I chose not to send dishes back, merely reflecting on what could have gone awry.

I'm open to a third visit – to break the tie. For now, I award this restaurant three stars, with a hope that consistency will be on the menu next time.",1
19125,"Title: A Mixed Bag at the Local Curry Spot

I've dined at this curry establishment twice and have had quite the mixed experience. The highlight, a perfectly fried katsu, shines through an otherwise standard menu. Be cautious if you're sensitive to strong flavors, as the dishes I tried on my second visit were overwhelmingly salty and garlicky.

The service, unfortunately, is a letdown. During both visits, the waitstaff displayed a lack of attentiveness, taking an excessive amount of time to provide menus and take orders. The restaurant's slow service becomes particularly frustrating given the inevitable weekend crowds.

A note on spice levels: there seems to be a disconnect in the kitchen. My order was confused with my friend's on our first visit, resulting in a meal too fiery for her palate and a subsequent lack of water refills despite our requests.

In essence, if you're willing to wait and can handle potential inconsistencies in food and service, this curry place might just satisfy your fried katsu cravings. However, if you value attentive service and reliably seasoned dishes, you might want to look elsewhere.",1
2033,My daughter is self quarantined in a small( tiny?) apartment in NYC. Just her and the cat. She is thankfully able to work remotely but I knew she was tired of soup and beans and pasta so I researched pizza places near her. Vezzo was just the place. I did a no contact order and you can track them online.I was able to do the entire transaction via credit card including tip. I did have to make sure she had clothes on!! Lol. It was a surprise to her and she loved it. She loves thin and crispy crust and this hit the mark. She shared with the doorman ( using strict social distancing) because he keeps her safe and monitors her comings and goings. The pizza was delivered hot and fresh. She loved the mushroom side the most. So thanks Vezzo for helping me make my girls day a little brighter!,0
21042,"Title: A Hearty Taiwanese Brunch Delight

I recently discovered a gem for Taiwanese breakfast enthusiasts, thanks to a tip-off from Ben Hon's Instagram. My experience compelled me to visit not once, but twice, for a sampling of their brunch offerings. Here's the breakdown:

The Stef (breakfast pancake) is a feast in itself, loaded with spam, egg, a crispy sesame pancake, you tiao, all generously drizzled with house peanut sauce. With impressive portion sizes, the dish was a challenge to finish, especially when one arrives with a ravenous appetite. The fluffy eggs are a standout, perfectly cooked. On the flip side, the sauce could be served on the side, especially given the spam's natural saltiness.

Moving on to their Salty Soymilk—a savory concoction that pleasantly surprised me with its balanced flavor profile, avoiding the overt spiciness or sourness one might expect. An extra serving of fried crueller on the side would be perfect for mopping up the last drops.

The traditional Sweet Soymilk with youtiao whisked me back to cherished memories with my grandmother in Asia. The sweetness is perfectly pitched, inviting you to indulge without overwhelming the palate. An ideal dish for sharing, it leaves room for other menu explorations.

Their House Egg Pancake (dan bing) is another sharable treat. Its delicate crepe-like texture coupled with the Taiwanese-style egg offers a satisfying light meal. Again, I'd advocate for sauce on the side to suit personal preference.

The CNY special dessert was a stellar combination of salty and sweet, featuring Van Leuwen's Taiwanese pineapple cake ice cream with crispy bacon, all sandwiched between a fried sweet bun (mantou). A hearty dish, although the bun tends to surrender quickly to the chill of the ice cream.

Service at this spot is second to none. Stef, who is not only the namesake of their signature breakfast pancake but also the purveyor of excellent customer care, ensures a visit here is more than just a meal—it's a warm, attentive experience. I eagerly anticipate my return for dinner. Do yourself a favor and stop by for amazing food and service that goes above and beyond.",1
19217,"Title: Solid Hibachi Dining Experience with a Side of Disorganization

I recently visited Nikko for a birthday celebration with a large party of 15. While the restaurant does not accept reservations—a surprising policy for big groups—we were nonetheless seated promptly. Service, however, started off on a slower note as we waited for some time to be greeted and receive our menus.

For my dinner choice, I indulged in the steak and shrimp hibachi combo, which stood out for its generous portion sizes, surpassing those at other hibachi venues I've frequented. The highlight of my visit was the happy hour, available daily until 8pm—a rare find especially on weekends. Both the Lychee Martini and The Paris drink I sampled were exceptionally crafted, boasting a well-measured mix of strength and flavor.

Our celebration included a birthday cake, and here we faced a minor hiccup; after our meal, to cut the cake, we were moved to a different part of the restaurant. The staff seated us at a table that could not accommodate our entire party, leaving some of us standing.

Despite the seating mix-up, my experience at Nikko was far from negative. The good food, superb drinks, and overall atmosphere have me looking forward to returning, particularly for happy hour.",1
1287,"Tucked away near Koreatown, this restaurant proved to be a real hidden gem where my friend and I indulged in an exceptional Labor Day dinner.

Regrettably, the feast fell short of expectations. Both the shui mai and the chive with shrimp offerings were overwhelmingly shrimpy, overshadowing the delicate balance one anticipates in dim sum. The beef and vegetable variety and the pork spring rolls were merely passable, failing to elevate our experience. While the spare ribs failed to entice me visually, my boyfriend found a silver lining in their savory goodness.

Despite our anticipation, the meal's underperformance has left me disenchanted, steering my future culinary quests away from Dim Sum Go Go in favor of other potential dim sum havens.",1
10360,"I recently visited this charming Greek restaurant to celebrate a friend's birthday and left thoroughly impressed. The food was a standout, incredibly fresh and flavorful, leaving an enduring impression on my palate. The olive oil, in particular, was a revelation – unbelievably fresh and so good I could envision enjoying it daily. Generous portions and affable service only added to the delightful experience. I'm already looking forward to my next visit!",1
15112,"Tried their dim sum!! It's very hot, very fresh, and very delicious here! Came with my in laws and they really loved it too! If you've never been - this is how it works. You get a table. You tell the waiter what tea you want. You see waiters carrying trays or pushing carts with steaming food that looks yummy, you point to it and they give it to you and put a stamp on your check that's on your table already. You share everything with everyone. If there's not enough order more. At the end, they tally up everything you ate and you pay the bill and leave full and happy.My recommendations - 1) BBQ pork in a flaky buttery pastry roll2) steamed glutinous rice with pork inside3) any kind of rice roll - but my favorite is BBQ pork or parsley 4) fried rice roll with salty shrimp and spring onions5) buns - any buns, but my favorite is the custard bunIf you are still hungry - you can also ask the waiter to bring you a fried rice or a stir fried beef noodle. Omg I'm so hungry thinking about this!",0
1457,"Title: A Second Chance for Xinjiang Delights

I recently ventured out of my culinary comfort zone at a local Xinjiang eatery, where my usual go-to is the sizable and satisfying big chicken platter. This time, my dining experience centered on their baked buns with lamb, a rather unique presentation involving a substantial loaf of bread crowned with lamb and perched atop a robust, stew-like sauce.

While the bread itself was notably enjoyable, the overall dish didn't fully meet my expectations. The sauce's overpowering saltiness clashed with the slightly gamey flavor of the lamb. However, when transformed into small sandwiches, the combination was somewhat redeemed, enhancing the flavors and making the meal more palatable, albeit still not a personal favorite.

Despite this experience, my affection for Xinjiang cuisine remains unshaken. With an eye toward my beloved big chicken platter, I'm keen to return and re-engage with the familiar and delectable flavors that initially drew me to this cultural culinary gem.",1
2838,"Upon my recent visit to a local dining spot, I encountered a somewhat peculiar seating arrangement; as a party of two, we were ushered to share a larger communal table with other small groups—a fine setup for social butterflies, but potentially uncomfortable for those seeking intimacy.

Our culinary journey began with the Zuke Maguro, a dish of soy-marinated tuna chunks priced at $11. While the flavors were rich and pleasing, the texture fell short, lacking the tenderness I had anticipated.

The Tetnsunabe Pork Gyoza, also $11, arrived with a buzz of commendations, yet left much to be desired. The exterior was crisped to perfection, and the ginger scallion sauce provided a bright note, but the filling was disappointingly mushy, a critical flaw in an otherwise promising dish.

The Sticky Ribs, at $9, presented an initial burst of savoriness, but the intense flavor profile proved to be too much as the meal progressed, overshadowing the meat's superb tenderness.

Tonkotsu ramen emerged as the undeniable highlight. For $12, the small bowl was an impressive concoction of perfectly sauced pork chashu, flawlessly cooked eggs, and noodles with an ideal chew, all swimming in a delectable soup base. In hindsight, it would have been prudent to forgo the appetizers and indulge in a larger portion of this masterpiece.

Service was adequate, albeit with a sense of urgency that bordered on pushy, detracting from the overall experience.

In summary, the Tonkotsu is worth a try, but I would advise against the appetizers. The restaurant offers flavorful options with mixed execution, set in a social, yet potentially rushed atmosphere.",1
1588,"Title: A Night of Perfection

I recently dined at an exquisite restaurant that left a lasting impression from the moment I entered. The decor instantly enveloped us in warmth, setting the stage for an exceptional evening.

The service was impeccable, with attentive staff ensuring our experience was nothing short of perfect. Our culinary journey commenced with a delightful mushroom soup, rich in flavor, followed by a refreshing medley of fish crudos, including black cod and salmon, each leaving a pleasant acidic zing on the palate.

Our main course featured succulent lamb shanks atop creamy polenta, drenched in a divine reduction sauce that truly elevated the dish. The generous portions were heartily appreciated. To complement our meal, we selected a Bordeaux, its robustness harmoniously pairing with the lamb.

For dessert, the gelato medley and the indulgent s'mores over warm chocolate cake concluded our meal on a sweet high note.

It was restaurant week, and the establishment rose to the occasion, delivering a dining experience that embodied perfection in every bite.",1
20101,"Title: Unmet Expectations at La Pecora Bianca Brunch

My anticipation to experience brunch at La Pecora Bianca was met with disappointment. Despite the allure of their online presentation, the food and service didn't live up to the hype. I opted for the Baked Egg, which was regretfully overcooked to a rubbery texture, and the spicy tomato sauce lacked the promised kick. My companions had the Frittata and Eggs Benedict, but none of us were particularly impressed. While the complimentary Bellini was appreciated, it was not enough to compensate for the overall experience.

Additionally, service inconsistencies further detracted from our meal. Our waiter was elusive throughout and seemed to vanish completely by the time we sought the check. The seamless coordination you'd expect in a busy NYC brunch spot was missing.

Though the wine list and decor were impressive, they are but consolation prizes in the vital brunch scene of the city. Simply put, La Pecora Bianca didn't stand out enough for me to consider a return visit when there are countless other options available.",1
1516,"I recently dined at this restaurant with a group of friends and came away less than thrilled. The setup is a large communal table, and we were seated adjacent to the kitchen. Service was decent, but the food didn't live up to expectations. Our table tried several ramen options, including Steak Mazemen, Crème de Bacon, Uni Ikura Mazemen, and Bone Marrow Ramen, along with Umami Kombu Fries to start.

The fries, amusingly compared to fast-food by one of my companions, were a tepid beginning. We were disappointed to find that the Yuzu scallop crudo and uni toast were unavailable. The dishes that did arrive were generally lackluster. The uni in the Uni Ikura Mazemen was poorly presented and paired with a bitter sauce, while the bone marrow ramen was forgettable. The steak was overly salty and fattier than preferred, as was the pork belly. Most notably, the noodles lacked the fresh 'bite' characteristic of good ramen.

Considering the high price point, I found the experience disappointingly mediocre.",1
17628,"Title: Disappointing Tuna Hand Rolls at a Chic Late-Night Spot

I recently visited a restaurant with a dark, late-night vibe, featuring interiors bathed in black with tasteful gold lighting accents and cozy seating. The bar area, with its solitary TV tuned to sports, seemed inviting. However, the semblance of sophistication didn't extend to the food.

Under an ""Eats Week"" special, I snagged a Tuna Avocado Hand Roll for a mere $1.09, tax included—a steal compared to the usual price, but there's a catch. The regular price for two Tuna Hand Rolls stands at $5.50, which might seem reasonable until you see the portion size: a paltry 4-5 bites will see the end of your meal, leaving you both hungry and lighter in the wallet.

Moreover, I committed a culinary faux pas by expecting quality sushi at a Chinese venue. Predictably, the sushi didn't measure up; the seaweed was soggy and my order arrived 5 minutes late—small irritations that nonetheless marred the dining experience.

The atmospheric setting might make this a decent choice for a date night if ambiance is your sole concern. But when it comes to the food, especially the sushi, it's a letdown. I'd rate this experience 2 out of 5 stars, salvaged only by the enjoyable environment.

For Manhattan residents curious about my $1 meal deal, drop me a message. I can also guide you on how to use a new app that offers a $10 benefit for your first purchase.",1
3526,"Title: A Dream Fulfilled at PSP

After months of salivating over PSP's Instagram feed, I had the pleasure of visiting this pizza haven this summer. Arriving at 11:30 am, we were greeted by the delightful absence of a queue. I indulged in a Sicilian square and a spicy pepperoni square, while my sister opted for a classic pepperoni and a mouth-watering creation of pesto with ricotta. The experience surpassed my lofty expectations; each bite brought a piece of pizza paradise that resonated with my soul. The mere thought of that visit makes me eagerly anticipate my next, but for now, their Instagram will tide me over. PSP didn't just serve pizza; they served a dream on a plate.",1
11420,"Title: A Spooktacular Dining Experience

I had the pleasure of dining at a truly unique spot a few weeks back—perfect for fans of revelry and amusement. Celebrating my friend's birthday, the evening was an absolute hoot, complete with unexpected entertainment by none other than a Beetlejuice impersonator, who added a quirky twist to our celebration by engaging guests with whispered antics.

The proximity to the Beetlejuice Broadway show adds to the charm, making it an almost essential stop for theater-goers. The food and drinks were top-notch, featuring delicious flavors that matched the high energy of the place. Plus, the service was commendable for the most part, with attentive and polite staff.

However, the evening did have a wrinkle. The persistent up-selling of side items was a bit much, proving to be a slight annoyance despite our clear disinterest. Fortunately, the issue was resolved, but it required a firmer stance than preferred.

Nevertheless, I'm looking past this hiccup and still recommending this establishment for a fantastic night out. With a slightly less aggressive sales approach, it would've been flawless. 4/5 stars.",1
14276,"I recently enjoyed a pizza night that far exceeded my expectations at a local spot, especially with their Gorgonzola pizza. The blend of sharp Gorgonzola, savory Prosciutto, and rich Parmesan, all balanced by a generous heap of fresh arugula, turned a dull Sunday evening into a culinary delight. I'd not only recommend it but am also looking forward to my next visit for a repeat performance.",1
2028,"I recently visited by Chloe, which is conveniently located close to my office and found the experience to be consistent with the brand's standard. The standout dish was undoubtedly the quinoa taco salad, bursting with flavor and fresh ingredients. Another recommendation would be the satisfyingly savoury guac burger, a close second to the salad. For pasta lovers, the pesto pasta is a love note to Italian cuisine with a vegan twist.

Added note: Do not miss the salted caramel CHILL push pop paired with the banana walnut bread — a delightful treat that sweetly wrapped up the meal.",1
14899,"Great place for a pint in midtown (near Times Square).  O'Briens is much better and more intimate than the big, gaudy ""pubs"" on 45th.  Definitely recommend.  Had a few beers with some colleagues on Tues night and came back the next night for a beer to watch hockey and the bartender remembered my name.  Pretty awesome, but crazy in NYC.  Music was great the 2nd night. First night the guy was a little loud and he allowed a couple of women customers to sing along that...well let's say....sang with more enthusiasm than they had skill.  Will come back for sure the next time I am here (unless I see customers ""helpingL the guitarist!)",0
3670,"Title: Disappointing Experience Aboard The Lobster Voyager

My recent dining experience on the Lobster Voyager was underwhelming, to say the least. Despite the unique concept of a boat that leaves the dock hourly, the service and food failed to impress.

Firstly, the restaurant's seating arrangement was confusing. As guests, we found ourselves shuffled around with unclear instructions regarding the areas we were permitted to access, which led to unnecessary frustration and a disjointed experience. Staff members provided conflicting information, both about the seating and departure times, adding to the chaos.

As for the food, expectations for a fresh maritime feast fell flat. The main attraction, the lobster, was a letdown - tough and overly fishy, suggesting it was not as fresh as one would hope for a dining experience on the water.

On a positive note, the view from the boat was enjoyable, as was the complimentary boat ride. However, these aspects could not compensate for the overall disappointing service and lackluster meal we experienced.",1
12533,"Title: A Brunch Haven in FiDi: My Westville Experience

If you ever wander into FiDi craving brunch, Westville is a noteworthy stop. Unlike its more quaint siblings, this Westville embraces the commercial vibe of its financial district home, appealing to the younger, bustling crowd that dominates the area.

Their California Benedict redefines my standard for Eggs Benny. Poached eggs rest on a bed of crispy potato hash, complemented by corn, avocado, and a zesty sriracha hollandaise, with the optional salmon addition being a delectable and worthy upgrade. Their Market Veggies are a triumph as well, especially the Brussels Sprouts and (guilty pleasure) French Fries.

Sizable portions, creative dishes, and a lively atmosphere earn Westville a resounding thumbs up!",1
20774,"Title: A Taste of Authenticity at Pho Vietnam

My wife and I had the pleasure of dining at Pho Vietnam this afternoon. We were greeted by a nearly empty restaurant, which meant we had the luxury of space, jokingly taking an eight-person table just for the two of us.

Opting for traditional choices, my wife enjoyed the pho tai while I savored the pho tai nam. The highlight was undoubtedly the broth and the beef, both rich in flavor and well-prepared. The only hiccup in an otherwise delightful meal was the pho noodles themselves, which didn't have the softness we anticipated.

What set this meal apart wasn't just the food, but the authenticity of the experience. It's rare to find a Vietnamese-owned and operated restaurant in NYC, and Pho Vietnam fills that niche. Exchanging pleasantries in Vietnamese with the cashier added a personal touch to our visit, making us feel connected to a community we've missed.

In conclusion, Pho Vietnam may not have perfected their pho noodles, but they've captured the essence of Vietnamese hospitality. The warmth of the staff and the genuine interactions make it a place worth revisiting.",1
2831,"Title: A Sushi Must-Try in the City!

If you're a sushi enthusiast, this place is a gem! Their hand rolls are absolutely worth the accolades – a perfect blend of flavor and texture that leaves you wanting more. Opt for the recommended sets to experience a curated taste journey; they won't disappoint.

Bear in mind, they don't accept reservations, so patience is key as there may be a wait. Once inside, a paper menu greets you to streamline your selection process. Their salmon sashimi, albeit thinly sliced, is delightful and sprinkled with sesame seeds for an added touch.

The highlight, however, is their rolls. A word to the wise: devour them right away to savor the delightful crunch of the seaweed. Filling and satisfying, these rolls are a standout culinary delight that you absolutely must try when in the city. And as a bonus, this is a no-tipping establishment – so enjoy those amazing rolls without extra worries!",1
19845,"Upon my recent visit to one of New York City's finest Italian establishments, I was utterly impressed. The pasta dishes here are phenomenal, with a varied wine selection that perfectly complements the cuisine. Service was impeccable, contributing to the overall delightful ambiance. However, it's a popular joint, so snagging a reservation is a wise choice to avoid waiting.

The Polpo, with its perfectly seared octopus accompanied by a refreshing mix of potato, celery, and red onion, is a standout dish that shouldn't be missed. Equally impressive is the Tartare, an exquisite combination of raw Elysian Fields lamb, egg yolk, caper, and black truffle; a dish that truly raises the bar.

The Tagliolini, a squid ink pasta with a generous serving of crab, chili, and basil, offers a delightful kick, while the Malfatti with braised suckling pig and arugula simply melts in your mouth. The pièce de résistance, though, has to be the Maialino al Forno—slow-roasted suckling pig with rosemary potatoes that is divine and deserving of its 'must-get' label.

In sum, this restaurant is a gem for anyone craving authentic Italian cuisine with a touch of excellence.",1
2323,"I'm usually a tame eater the day before infusion, but threw caution to the wind this Friday afternoon because I craved falafel. Craaaaved it. We decided to order at the restaurant and eat at the counter overlooking John Street. I went right for the Chili Falafel Burger--a crisply cooked falafel patty topped with Mediterranean bbq sauce, avocado, tomato, lettuce, and jalapeño mayo served on a fresh brioche bun. I was asked if I wanted a salad or fries, and if I was hungrier I'd have gone with the salad. But I knew my husband could down the fries. Oh, and I got a little cup of fresh, tangy tabouli as well (for me, me, meeeeee). The burger was falafel perfection, I tell you, falafel perfection! The bbq sauce and jalapeño mayo were the perfect compliments, and I also enjoyed the little pickles and green olive served on the side. The fries were average, but I wasn't eating them anyway. My sweet, meat-loving husband ordered the halloumi salad, which is so different for him, but he loved it! He's a hearty eater, this tall, slim guy, and it filled him up. He especially loved the sautéed onions, the cheese, and the garlic dill dressing. The place was clean and the service was good. We took a couple baklava home with us, and that was lovely as well.We're definitely coming back so I can try more from that menu (hubby will stick to the halloumi -- he finds something he likes and sticks with it).",0
15352,"Last night's early dinner at The Mermaid Inn was a delightful experience. The highlight for me was the impressive selection of small dishes, with the added bonus of happy hour prices. Our server, Ethan, provided fantastic service, contributing to an overall excellent dining experience. Note to future diners: arrive early! We got there at 5:00 PM and by 6:00 PM, the place was packed—a clear sign of the establishment's popularity. With only a sampling of appetizers, I'm holding back on a full five-star rating but would certainly recommend The Mermaid Inn for their tasty bites and top-notch service.",1
147,"Veselka is an East Village institution. I came here for the first time a little under a year ago and have kept coming back ever since. My favorite dishes here are the potato latkes, the pierogies and the cold borscht. The latkes are perfectly crisped on the outside, and soft on the inside. They're served with apple sauce and sour cream. The pierogies have a variety of different vegetarian fillings: broccoli and cheese, potato, cheese, and sauerkraut. All of them are really good and I can't pick a favorite. They're served with golden brown caramelized onions and sour cream. I also really like the Borscht, especially the cold kind. There is a vegetarian version that has the perfect ratio of beets to vegetable stock, and is super refreshing on a hot summer day. I also really like their chocolate mousse cheesecake, which they gave me with a candle for my birthday. They also offer a full western brunch menu alongside their typical fare on weekends. There is usually a wait if you go there during peak meal times, especially on weekends, but this place is well worth the wait. I've been here in groups as small as two and groups as large as 8 or 10, and there has never been a problem. The service has also been consistently great every time I've gone. The servers are in good spirits and pay good attention to detail.",0
2442,"Title: A Friday Night Gem for Sake and Ramen

I had a fantastic experience at this bustling little spot on a busy Friday at 7 PM. Despite the crowd, my party of three was seated swiftly within 10 minutes — a stroke of luck as the place quickly filled to the brim. The cozy ambiance is complemented by an impressive bar showcasing a variety of Sakes.

We kicked off with sake, beer, and appetizers — the standout being the Pork Belly. As something of a pork belly connoisseur, I was thoroughly impressed; it arrived sizzling on cast iron, three succulent chunks glazed in sweetness atop a bed of cabbage — a must-try.

The ramen didn't disappoint either. I opted for the tonkatsu ramen, which hit all the right notes with its flavorful broth, perfectly cooked noodles, and a soft-boiled egg done just right. The option to press fresh garlic into the bowl as it’s served is a thoughtful addition to an already great dish.

The staff, from the server to the manager and hostess, were all incredibly hospitable. This place has earned itself a repeat customer in me. Highly recommend for anyone craving an authentic ramen fix paired with excellent service.",1
13078,"I recently dined at a charming spot that truly feels like a city escape within the bustling urban landscape. Despite its classic diner vibe, it offers modern takes on breakfast favorites.

12198,"Title: A Hidden Gem Near Chinatown

I spontaneously decided to dine at this Korean spot near Chinatown and, quite frankly, it was a delightful surprise. The Kimchi Pork Soon Tofu was a standout dish; with its fresh tofu, succulent pork, and a broth that struck the perfect balance of flavor and spice. It was the kind of meal that satisfies your soul. Additionally, the Kimchi and Macaroni Salad was a hit, offering a tasty twist on the traditional side dish.

Service didn't lag behind either. A friendly waitress was attentive, answering all inquiries with a smile and ensuring a clean and comfortable dining experience. In a nutshell, if you're in the area, this place is definitely worth a visit.",1
14609,"This review is for delivery/take out only.Solid brunch fare - rich and hearty Overall: 4/5Food: 4/5Value: 4/5 Packaging: 4.25/5We got the lemon ricotta pancakes ($16), nova benny ($19), and egg white omelet ($17) with side of herb fries ($8). The portions were fairly decent sized, and nicely packaged with sauces (ketchup, maple syrup) on the side to avoid the food getting soggy. Only complaint on packaging was that the fries were put in a paper bag, which was pretty greasy to handle. The lemon ricotta pancakes were fluffy and had good zest, while the smoked salmon was delicious in the nova Benny. Avocado on the egg white omelette came quite browned but it's a result of the lengthened time between preparation and consumption so not necessarily restaurant's fault. Value wise it's not overly expensive for NY at $15-20 a dish  but thought the side of fries for $8 was a bit high. Would recommend for brunch food overall.",0
13541,"I rate this place a star less only for the high cost and the moderate quantity they offer. The taste of the food you get here is incredible and love the richness and authenticity they offer along. I dropped by here to collect a To-go and the veg platter they have is a three course from a standard menu of Malai Kofta, paneer butter masala, palak paneer or a dhal.The checkout process was quite quick and the order was made ready in no time. The place was pretty much crowded and that resonated that the quality of service should also be good. I additionally got a set of samosas which to much of my delight was heated in the microwave and then fried fresh in oil before packing it. This is something you don't get to see in a lot of Indian restaurants.",0
10002,"**Title: A Delightful Deli Experience at the Heart of NYC - Second to None!**

During my latest visit to my favorite NYC deli, I was reminded once again why it stands unparalleled in my gastronomic heart. The food here isn't just delicious; it's a sumptuous parade on a plate with generously portioned servings that ensure you leave with a full belly and a satisfied smile.

Service is top-tier, and I must give a hearty shout-out to Max, who embodies the delightful hospitality that makes this place shine. His attentiveness was on point - guessing my inner debate and offering a more manageable half sandwich with a comforting bowl of matzo ball soup instead of the full-sized behemoth I had initially ordered. That soup, with its hearty matzo ball, carrots, egg noodles, and the pièce de résistance - a golden chicken broth - was the epitome of comfort food.

Meanwhile, my friend relished her usual meat platter, a delectable combo of pastrami and brisket. After stealing a taste, I've decided my next visit will be dedicated to all pastrami. The mere thought makes my mouth water; it's a must-try when dipped in their signature mustard.

Even their tuna salad sandwich impressed, with flaked white tuna, the perfect touch of mayo and celery, neatly dressed with lettuce, tomato, and red onion on rye. A half portion, alongside the soup, was the perfect amount.

Though we couldn't indulge in dessert, the complimentary shots of chocolate egg creme were a sweet touch to end the meal. I'm already planning to take home some of their Rugelach and Kugel pudding next time - the deli counter's display looked too tempting to pass up again.

Yes, you might find the prices a tad steep, but for the food quality and the joy it brings, it's worth every penny. And just for the record, despite its name, the 2nd Ave Deli proudly stands on 1st Ave - a quirky reminder that it's full of delightful surprises.",1
13694,"Came here with a friend for a catch-up dinner Sunday evening. Located at the crossing of 29th street and Madison Avenue. Cozy and intimate ambiance. The decoration gives you a romantic feeling. Perfect option for date night or a girls night out. The service was very attentive, the waiter explained the menu and apologized that two options were not available that night. The complementary bread was fresh and love the eggplant dip! As me and friend both cut down the meat intake, we chose yellowtail from the crudo menu and picked the black cod and the black bass as our entrees. The portion was perfect, presentation was beautiful. I tried both and I prefer the black cod. The texture of the fish was very tender, and the sauce was perfectly seasoned. The tomato  goes well with the fish, added a little bit sweetness and acidity to increase the freshness. We ended our dinner with the dessert torta sabbiosa (black mission figs, marsala sabayon & fromage blanc sorbet), a great combination of creamy and fruity flavors.It was a great experience dining here, the per person cost (after tips) is approx $93, including one glass of wine. Highly recommended and will try the pasta here next time!",0

Even then, the different egg options took up an entire page. There were both egg sandwiches and omelettes - even one with corned beef. Yum. The corned beef was peppery and briny. Since I had a substantial dinner the evening before, I opted not to have any toast just to stay on track with my nutrition plan.What struck me was the warmth and friendliness between the regulars and the staff.",0
20210,"Cowgirl was suggested to me by my younger daughter, an NYC resident. It is good having a relative who's a local, because I never would have found this place. I actually walked right by it's non-descript storefront at first. Initially, things didn't start well. When we explained that 1 member of our party of 4 was a few minutes late, the hostess refused to seat us. I get that rule, but the ATTITUDE she copped doing it was very rude. We were shunted to the bar to wait. There we encountered a bartender who made it seem like we were REALLY disturbing her by ordering a drink. 3 words for her: stone cold beeeotch. Finally we were seated at a comfortable enough booth, at least until they hemmed us in by seating a party of 12 mere inches from us...ugh. Things got better when our server promptly and cheerfully delivered our food. I was pleasantly surprised with my app of Rattlesnake Bites...well-cooked jalapeños stuffed with shrimp and wrapped in bacon...an interesting and ultimately delicious combo. My entree was the baby back ribs. They were great. I'm used to a long rack of thin ribs, whereas these were shorter, but oh so much meatier. They had a perfect Texas-style flavor and for the second time in as many days, I'm amazed to find such good bbq in the ""big city"". Sides were cole slaw (forgettable), mashed potatoes (meh) and baked beans. These were excellent with an initial meaty taste with a tangy finish. The others at the table had the pulled pork sandwich which I found to be abhorrently vinegar-y! I know some people like vinegar flavored food, but I was repulsed, just sayin'. So, overall: LOVED my ribs and app, HATED the attitude, Cowgirl gets a score of 3.5",0

If you're on the hunt for a milkshake marvel, this is your go-to spot! Their colossal and adventurous milkshakes aren't just drinks; they're a full-blown sensory delight that palate adventurers will relish.

Admittedly, the prices are on the steep side for a casual dining locale, but the culinary offerings justify the expense. The menu, although pricy, delivers on taste and satisfaction. Our server was impressively attentive, effortlessly keeping track of our party of six's diverse choices without so much as jotting down a note. The promptness with which our meals arrived only added to the positive experience.

While the cost may give pause for regular visits, the milkshake's photogenic allure and the exemplary service make for an indulgent, Instagram-worthy outing when you're feeling extravagant.",1
20923,"To be honest its more like a 3.75. I came here with a friend after seeing all the raving reviews and i was slightly disappointed. Pros are that the restaurant's decor is upscale without being suffocating and they are surprisingly creative with food presentation. The food however are not as impressive. We had ordered the Shanghai soup dumpling, the bbq buns, the shrimp dumplings and the pork bone broth noodles. They were all ok, the best being the bbq bun.

I had found it for a friend who came to town to see Harry Potter & needed a place to eat nearby in between the 2 Parts--she really liked it so figured recently I'd try it myself and went on a Sun night with a friend. We ordered a couple drinks each, a bunch of tapas, and my friend had the more substantial hanger steak dish too. For drinks I had the rosado sangria (fine, nothing special) and the shishito margarita (pretty good); my friend had 2 mojitos. The tapas we tried: the garlic shrimp, grilled octopus, bacon-wrapped dates, the croquetas, the lamb meatballs, and the crispy potatoes (minus the garlic aioli). Portion sizes are decent (especially generous with the shrimp and potatoes) & we had to take some of it home. I wasn't really blown away by anything but it was all tasty enough & presented nicely. Total came out to a bit over $200. Bathrooms are in the attached hotel down a flight of stairs. Medium noise level when I was there--no problem hearing each other. Nice enough place to hang out with friends or go on a date, though all the nibbles do add up!",0

At the time, I remember being impressed by both the ambience of the restaurant, which gives a Parisian/European vibe, and by the quality of the bakery's bread. In today's world of fast food bread, bread like the kind you find at Balthazar's has become quite rare. On my visit today, though, instead of the bakery, I visited the restaurant. When we visited, we were immediately seated and fortunately we were able to have seats at a booth.  While the seats felt a little cramped, I imagine this was done purposefully to make the restaurant feel like a Parisian cafe. With respect to food, my family and I enjoyed the bread basket. The variety of bread was good, but it would have been nice if the bread was warm. For my main course, I ordered the scrambled eggs and puff pastry, a very unique dish. It was very enjoyable, though I think I would have been more satisfied with just a plate of pancakes.",0
15554,"While a little confusing to figure out just what restaurant we were in and what the service options were (there are two related but partially separate establishments depending on the floor/door you enter? We never really fully understood....) we were able to get a wonderful warm and filling meal on a very cold and rainy late afternoon before catching the train home.  We were in the small main floor bar area which definitely has an Irish pub vibe.  We were at a high top table, which did mean we had to go and order things-- drinks and food-- from the bartender but it all worked out just fine.  It was nothing fancy but prices were reasonable especially given their location steps from Times Square.  And these traditional pub dishes could not be beat.    We were there at a slightly off meal hour.  I can imagine this place can be absolutely slammed at peak hours.  Would definitely recommend.  Though I wouldn't stand in line to get in if it were super crowded.",0
12982,"Title: A Pleasant Brunch Experience

I visited this restaurant for brunch over the weekend and was greeted with a surprisingly uncrowded space at noon on a Saturday. The interior presented a spacious surprise, boasting a generous number of tables and booths. My friend and I chose a table near the entrance, basking in the natural light from the expansive windows.

Service was a highlight—with attentive and respectful servers enhancing our dining experience. As for the fare, I opted for the Cali burrito while my companion savored the pork hash and eggs. While both dishes were well-prepared, they didn't quite leap into the realm of extraordinary.

Despite this, the relaxed environment provided the perfect backdrop for an enjoyable catch-up session with my friend. Overall, the restaurant delivers a solid brunch experience deserving of recommendation.",1

CASTELLO SONNINO 2015 - $17sangiovese blend, chianti montespertoli riserva, toscana, italy*I'm headed to Tuscany in 2 months so I'm trying to always order Italian wine and this was a nice dry medium bodied wine.

16251,"Title: Lackluster Flavors at a Korean Spot

My recent dining experience at this restaurant left much to be desired. I opted for the Spicy Pork Stone Bowl, which, contrary to its name, lacked any real heat or the distinct punch of flavor I've savored at other establishments in Philly. My companion had the Fried Tiger Rolls and Chili Shrimp; while they found the shrimp pleasing, I remained unimpressed. Although the tiger rolls boasted impressive size, they unfortunately fell short on taste. Those in search of truly delectable Korean bowls in NYC might want to continue their quest elsewhere.",1
18668,"This restaurant has been on my must go-to list for a while. I was so happy when I was able to get a reservation for 5 here for restaurant week. The vibe is trendy. I loved the decor (leaves on the wall) and how spacious it was. The wait staff are all gorgeous and looked exotic with accents. It felt as if I was on vacation somewhere exotic. The restaurant menu looked so good, it was hard to choose. I ordered the spicy beef salad to start. I really did not like it so I switched with my husband who ordered the ravioli. Everyone else at the table seemed to like the spicy beef salad, it was just not for me. My sister's boyfriend ordered the noodle salad and it was delicious. For the entree, my sister and brother ordered salmon, it was moist and tasty. I ordered the chicken, which was delicious. Loved that it had lemongrass flavor. My husband and my sister's boyfriend got the shaking beef. The beef was much tastier than the beef on the salad. Every entree came with a choice of jasmine rice or sticky rice. I ordered the sticky rice. It was mixed with scallions and some other veggies and was delicious. For dessert, I chose the sorbet. I o my for coconut because I am allergic to red food dye and was nervous it would be in that. The sorbet was delicious. Those at my table who ordered the sorbet, wished they only got the coconut. They all complained that the raspberry was too tart. We all ordered one cocktail. I had one with bourbon in it that was very tasty. The presentation of the food and cocktails were done very well. The service was also pretty good except the waitress added Evian water to our bill. She did quickly take it off though. I did not like that the bus boy cleared the plates before we were done and that the hostess mispronounced my very easy to say name 3x even though I corrected her each time. All in all, I am happy that I went. We all had a great time. We were all pleasantly surprised at how big the portions were. My sister and I did not even finish our meals and had to wrap them up.",0

11596,"Tucked away in the bustling East Village lies a Japanese gem that serves up more than your average bowl of ramen. Upon arrival, the aesthetic charm of the place sets a delightful stage for what is to be a culinary treat.

We kicked off our meal with their famed gyoza, and it didn't disappoint. Each piece was a harmonious blend of succulent filling and perfectly crisped exteriors—an appetizer that truly whets the appetite.

The ramen here stands out in a city brimming with noodle joints, boasting authenticity and a refined palate. A pleasant surprise was their lighter broth, rich in flavor yet not overly dense, allowing the subtleties of the ingredients to shine. The house special, swimming in a delicate fish stock, offers a refreshing take on the classic dish.

Opting for the chicken paitan, I was nostalgically transported by its homey essence, reminiscent of a soothing chicken soup. The inclusion of tender pork belly slices and a perfectly cooked egg in both dishes rounded out the meal with a touch of decadence.

For those with a smaller appetite, the option to order smaller servings is a thoughtful touch. This is a spot that knows its craft and respects the diversity of its clientele—a welcomed addition to the East Village's dining landscape.",1
3300,"I recently visited a charming restaurant nestled in the Upper East Side that delighted my senses with its pleasing decor and impeccable cleanliness, right down to the restrooms.

The menu boasts a versatile selection of small plates perfect for any palate, including vegetarian and vegan options, as well as more substantial entrees. This spot is a true gem for those seeking quality dining in a cozy atmosphere.",1
16164,"Title: An Evening of Jazz and Wine with a Side of Space Issues

My wife and I had an impromptu date night at City Winery, a unique establishment that doubles as a wine bar and jazz club. The allure of Philip Bailey performing sealed the deal for us. The interior of the club was stunning, featuring an elegant bar and inviting window tables, but the arrangement of the seating in the concert area was a cause for concern. The tables were uncomfortably cramped, which was quite intrusive to the concert-going experience.

Despite the tight quarters, we arrived early to secure a good spot and opt out of dinner, having eaten prior. We settled for a bottle of bubbly and what was described on the menu as a Margarita Flatbread. To our surprise, it was more of a round pizza. Tasty, but a misnomer nonetheless.

As showtime neared, the cramped space became more of an issue. A neighboring table's inconsiderate order, which arrived moments before the performance, was large enough to rival a Thanksgiving feast. This resulted in a rather disruptive experience, as we were there specifically to enjoy the sonic splendor of Bailey's performance.

Thankfully, the acoustics in the venue did not disappoint. Despite our seating towards the back, we had an excellent view of the stage. Philip Bailey's performance, especially his rendition of ""Sun Goddess,"" was nothing short of mesmerizing; it was a true highlight of our night at City Winery.

In summary, City Winery offers a feast for the eyes and ears with a side of spatial challenges. A reimagining of the seating arrangement could transform this spot into the perfect venue for an intimate and enjoyable evening of jazz.",1
14007,"Title: Mixed Feelings on Classy Brunch Spot

I visited a local restaurant for a family brunch last Saturday and was surprised to find the place nearly empty at noon. The restaurant's interior was a delightful mix of classy and casual, offering an inviting ambiance, although the lack of patrons made it hard to gauge the usual atmosphere.

Service was prompt and attentive, with our waiter striking a perfect balance between availability and space. The menu provided decent options, including a pre-fixe deal with or without unlimited mimosas. Opting for the à la carte, I chose the chicken and waffles, which were tasty, albeit with a misleading ""mixed berries"" description that turned out to be just strawberries.

Portion sizes didn't quite match up to the rather steep prices, and the sangria's lack of fruit variety (only Apple chunks) was a letdown. While the restaurant charmed me with its design and the food quality was acceptable, my brunch experience fell short of impressive, leaving room for improvement in both value and culinary execution.",1
10894,"It was quite hard to pick a place to eat in Little Italy but this was the right decision.  Haven't had family style pasta in quite sometime and this was a really good refresher. Three of us shared a few too many warm soft twisty garlic bread (but really is too many bread sticks even a thing ) and a family style portion Herb Garlic Garganelli pasta w/ broken meatball sauce...Sweet Baby!! The pasta was cooked to perfection, my goodness. It was soft,  lightweigt and green. The pasta wasn't as thick as I was anticipating but very filling for the size. The meatball chunks in the sauce were plentiful and hearty! The meatballs were really good and enough to fill each and every bite. I loved the sauce and the parmesan cheese was just the cherry on top as they say.  Lol Really need to come back here to try the squid ink pasta.  I'm sure that's delicious as well.

The burger, as you can see in the picture, is juicy and nicely put together.

12943,"Title: Delightful Surprise at Bambino’s

Last Saturday evening, a spontaneous decision led us to Bambino's, and despite the usual weekend crowds, we were impressed to be seated by 6:30 pm without a reservation. The dining experience kicked off with an exceptional Bambino's Vino—a clever and refreshing blend of ginger beer and wine that struck a perfect balance between sweetness and zest.

The much-acclaimed chrysanthemum salad lived up to its reputation, standing out as the star of the meal. It was a surprise favorite, making me a believer that a salad can indeed be a showstopper. The lasagna that followed was a cheesy delight; its generous portion could easily satisfy four, making it ideal for sharing alongside another dish.

While the tiramisu presented an interesting twist with its crunchy caramel addition, it wasn't quite to my taste. However, what truly rounded out the wonderful dining experience was the attentive service. The staff's eagerness to ensure prompt seating and a pleasant evening was very much appreciated.

In all, Bambino's delivered a great atmosphere, refreshing drinks, memorable dishes, and service with a smile. It's a spot I'll be revisiting soon, and I highly recommend giving it a go for a casual yet delectable outing.",1
3286,"Located in the bustling heart of NYC, where prices often reflect location, we found this spot a tad overpriced — yet what can one expect in the Big Apple? The standout for us was the Cambodian iced coffee, a truly delectable treat that was both refreshing and rich.

We opted for the pulled pork sandwich, which, while flavorful with a pleasing blend of spices that delighted the palate, unfortunately succumbed to sogginess within a minute or two of sitting down. Despite this, the 'num pang' bread was notably softer and more manageable than the traditional French baguette used in banh mi, making it easier to enjoy the sandwich.

Service was another bright spot, characterized by its quick and hassle-free nature, allowing us to dive into our meal with minimal wait time. Overall, if you're in the area and have a hankering for some uniquely flavored bites with a side of swift service, this could be a place to check out — just be prepared for NYC-level prices and potentially a quick eat before the bread gets a chance to soak through.",1
2402,"Title: Decent Happy Hour, Hit-and-Miss Seafood

I recently dined at this spot during happy hour and found their oysters to be quite enjoyable. The Lobster Mac and Cheese, rich and decadent, was the highlight of the meal, truly a must-try. However, the Cajun boil was a bit of a letdown; the snow crab lacked freshness, though the shrimp managed to redeem it slightly with its fresh and sweet taste. Desserts were unremarkable, and the service was passable but nothing to write home about. All things considered, I'd give this place a solid 3-star rating.",1
12304,"Friendly service, quirky atmosphere and amazing food. My favorite is the salmon dish - full of flavor, fresh, yet healthy",0
16083,"As a New Yorker currently residing in Los Angeles, I've had my fair share of Korean BBQ experiences. However, this restaurant took my palate by surprise with a wow factor that multiplied with every bite. For those familiar with LA's Korean BBQ heavyweights like Parks and Genwa, prepare to be impressed, as this establishment has managed to eclipse them.

The quality remains unbeatable even compared to what Manhattan has to offer, where, in my opinion, the Korean BBQ scene has unfortunately seen better days. Both the marinated and unmarinated options here are simply amazing – they're a must-try for any enthusiast.

The ambiance adds to the entire experience, crafting the perfect setting for a romantic date or a relaxed hangout spot. In short, this place is a definitive culinary hotspot for anyone looking to indulge in top-tier Korean BBQ.",1
17302,"Walking into the restaurant without any preconceived notions, my experience ended up being an unforeseen delight. My boyfriend and I chose the couple set, a generous spread featuring chicken curry, beef curry noodle, fried shrimp, pork cutlet, plus two drinks. It was a perfect match for our hearty appetites.

Each dish stood out on its own, but the beef curry noodle captured my attention unexpectedly. Anticipating the usual heaviness that accompanies curry, I was pleasantly surprised by the lightness of the dish. It's clear this spot has earned its hype genuinely; the food is simply fantastic.",1

13564,"Just had this place through a work lunch and we all were very delighted. Given we ordered on the spot for delivery they had no problem sending over $175 worth of food within 45 minutes during lunch hour - 3 pies, 3 Heros, 2 Salads, and a Pasta. For the pizza, my own version of Barstool One-Bite would be 7.4 which is good for a standard slice. I had both the Pepperoni and Buffalo chicken. If you like your pizza to be a bit more soft and doughy with extra cheese versus crispy and saucy, you'll enjoy this place. I was a huge fan of the buffalo chicken because it was a combo of mozzarella cheese, a small amount of blue cheese, and chicken cutlets tossed in hot sauce.  Would definitely get the buffalo chicken again. The pasta was baked ziti and ""par."" Not bad as a side thing but wouldn't go here specifically for ziti as I found it to be more on the saucy side. The most raved item was the Chicken Cutlet Sandwich. They had the perfect ratio of chicken cutlet, lettuce, tomato, mayo, and hero roll. If you work or live in the area and want to do a simple pizza party menu definitely consider this place!",0
20472,"Title: A Delectable Dive into Filipino Tapas at ""They Call Me Big Pata""

Upon seeing the amusing sign for ""They Call Me Big Pata,"" my curiosity was piqued, and what awaited was a delightful discovery of Filipino-style tapas that did not disappoint.

Despite an initial estimate of a 30-40 minute wait for our party of two, we were pleasantly seated in just 15 minutes on a bustling Saturday evening. The standout dish was the pork sisig— a symphony of textures with its crispy, fatty, and tender pork, sizzled on a hot skillet and crowned with a perfectly cooked egg. It's worth noting that rice isn't included, so pairing it with their aromatic garlic or coconut rice is a must.

Another hit was the grilled pork jowl complemented by saucy roasted brussel sprouts, creating a harmonious fusion of rich pork and charred greens. And for a refreshing twist, the cilantro soda was a revelation—evoking a non-alcoholic mojito vibe that could very well become a new favorite.

The innovative self-service unlimited draft beer system for $15 with a 1.5-hour limit is a fun touch for beer enthusiasts. However, I found the halo-halo underwhelming and overpriced at $9.

Intent on returning, ""They Call Me Big Pata"" has left me eager to delve further into their menu offerings. This gem offers a taste of the Philippines that's well worth a visit.",1
21109,"I swung by this spot for a quick pizza fix and wasn't disappointed. Despite a queue, it moved swiftly, and before I knew it, I was tucking into their white pizza. At $4 a slice, it struck a decent balance between cost and taste, boasting a crispy crust that held up to the essential fold-and-walk test of true portable pizza. While the flavor was satisfying, a little extra garlic punch would elevate this pizza from good to great. Overall, a solid choice for an on-the-go bite.",1
19192,"Amazin pizza!! I think this place wil be my new go to/favorite, particularly since the line at prince st is always ridiculously long (though i fear that the same will be true with this place). We got the sicilian and pepperoni squares and they were both amazing. The sauce in the sicilian was somehow more flavorful - or maybe there was simply just more of it / the saltiness of the pepperoni overpowered the other slice. We got corner slices so the cheese on the edges were crisped just perfectly so. What really stood out to me, and what i've never even noticed before, was the dough. The dough had a remarkable bounce and chewiness that i never experienced before. I think there couldve been a little more cheese -- but i think that about most anything i eat. They do have pepper flakes and oregano (?) and something else for you to indulge in. And special shoutout to NYT for bringing this place to my attention!",0
20031,"Had a recent 3 star experience at Jin Ramen.  It's a good-looking space, decorated with some flair, tables and bar tightly squeezed in; true NYC style. Sharing an appetizer, we tried veggie buns, like typical pork buns but replacing the pork with tofu. The tofu was a bit chewy and tasted too much of the oil it was fried in. The bun was bready and seemed sort of stale. As for the entrees, one dish (Miso ramen) was perfect. The second, a hot noodle dish with fried chicken pieces, wasn't great. The chicken was tasty, but the noodles were so drenched in a broth that was flat and a bit oily, overall it wasn't nearly as impressive as the ramen.I would go back for the ramen, but would skip the other two dishes that were tried.",0
2731,"Came here tonight for my sister's birthday. The place was very nice, had great ambience and the music selection was great. Upon sitting down noticed the service was less than par, had to ask repeatedly to refill water especially for today that was scorchingly humid and hot. As appetizers we ordered tableside guacamole which was decent, loved how the server made it fresh right next to your table. We ran out of chips and asked again repeatedly for a refill on that. Then our entrees came out. I ordered the grilled breast of chicken with orange-achiote sauce and pineapple mango salsa. It was decently flavored and the chicken was tender although hard to cut into. My sister had the   Carnitas Yucatan. It was slightly spicy and the pork was a little dry. Bro in law got the Carne Asada y Chimichurri. Steak was cooked medium rare but spicy and corn on the cob was also spicy. Overall the food was decent and service could be better. Atmosphere and ambience was good.",0

I'm not sure if I recommend eating a lot of either however as it takes up valuable stomach real estate that can be used on the other better dishes.We started with the arugula salad with tomatoes and cheese. This was ok but I wouldn't get it again. My dining partner doesn't like tomatoes so we avoided the Greek salad which is what I would normally order.The star of the show was the shrimp by the pound grilled with olive oil and garlic. This was one of the best grilled shrimp dishes I've ever had. Definitely recommended if you like shrimp.   We followed the shrimp with the lamb. It was perfectly cooked, juicy and flavorful. A great choice if you like lamb. We ended the meal with the olive oil cake recommended by the waiter. I was a bit hesitant as I've had some less than stellar olive oil cakes recently (cough, Lilia and Il Buco) but this was excellent. I think you are definitely missing out if you don't end with this - I was extremely full but got up and took a walk so I could fit another bite in. Sad I didn't get a picture!All in all, this place is a solid spot for a nice Greek meal. Just wish it was a bit more affordable so I could go more often.",0

One of us ordered a green juice that we had to remind them about, but it was really good and made up for the wait.

I haven't had one since then. Like seriously.What is a kati roll? It's a wrap, more like roll up using a paratha but if you want a ""lighter"" version, roti is used instead. You just pick your fillings.Kati rolls originated from Kolkata, India, which is on the west side of India, the Bengal region.I ordered mango lassi. Unfortunately, it's not fresh but the bottle version is actually good, not overly sweet or too thick either.

1278,"Title: A Hearty Thumbs Up for Fumo Catering!

I recently had the pleasure of catering a holiday event with Fumo, and I must say, the experience was an absolute delight. Normally, catering can be a tradeoff between quantity and quality, but Fumo’s impressive restaurant reviews reassured me that I was in for something special.

To begin with, we were pleasantly surprised by bags of fresh, sliced white country bread, which were unexpectedly included in our order. These would have been a welcome advertised addition on the catering menu. The garlic bread arrived in small, crusty slices, filling the room with an irresistible garlicky aroma that set the stage for the meal to come.

The Spinach Avocado Candied Nut Salad was a refreshing component, packed to the brim in a half tray. A tad more avocado would have been perfect, yet the flavors were spot on, and it taught me a lesson – order just a third for a large group, as it goes a long way!

Meanwhile, the meatballs were a savory treat, served in a delicious sauce not specified in the description but thoroughly enjoyed by all. Chicken Parmesan was the definitive crowd-pleaser with not a single piece left behind.

Both the Salmon and Branzino entrees were superbly seasoned and well-received. The Baked Ziti deserves a mention for its generous portion and tasty, comforting goodness, making it a favorite among the attendees.

For those with dietary preferences, the Vegan Cashew Pesto Pasta was a covert hit, with no one guessing it was vegan thanks to its creamy, chunky consistency. The Gluten-Free Pasta option, incorporated into the Funghi dish, was so delicious that guests were none the wiser about it being a healthier alternative.

Speaking of the Funghi Pasta, it boasted a potent truffle flavor and was packed with creamy, chunky mushrooms, winning over even those who can be fickle about fungi.

Lastly, the Broccoli sautéed with plenty of garlic yet without excessive oil was a welcome and popular green addition to the plates.

In conclusion, Fumo delivered a catering experience that exceeded expectations with delightful flavors and a diverse menu catering to various tastes and dietary needs. I'd heartily recommend Fumo for any event where great food is a must-have.",1
2712,"Title: Good Noodles, Average Dumplings

I had a meal that was a mix of hits and misses at this much-talked-about spot. The noodles were the standout—perfectly cooked and delightfully flavorful. However, the dumplings left a bit to be desired with their overly thick skins lacking that desirable chewiness.

In terms of sauces, the sour and spicy sauce served with the dumplings did win my palate over the noodle's spicy sauce, indicating a potential for redemption had the dumpling skins been on point.

While the prices are fair and reflect the quality on offer, I couldn't help but feel the establishment doesn't quite live up to its hype. It's a straightforward case of getting exactly what you pay for.

Ambience-wise, the restaurant does have some logistical quirks — the tables are exceptionally narrow, to the point where a single plate occupies most of the space, and the serving trays fit with no room to spare. It's cozy, to put it optimistically.

Overall, I'd recommend sticking with the noodles and flatbreads and managing expectations when it comes to the dining experience.",1

We decided on the crostinis (which could be mix/matched) and split a salad. All were excellent. We also shared the dessert tasting dish. It was a perfect size to share a small, sweet bite.

If you've been the the original location downtown, maybe you already know and love Georgian food. If you never made the schlep, prepare for cheese, bread and beet heaven. And don't bother with the entrees -- the appetizer & breads are where it's at! Highlights here are:1. the cheesy breads (we had the adjaruli, where the poached egg is stirred into the cheese tableside), which are rich with cheese and butter, ideal for sharing by 3-4 people. There are many try; this section of the menu is more than a page long. 2. The khakali trio. These are three beautifully presented and very tasty walnut-based spreads. They don't come with bread, which was surprising. 3. The beet salad. It's just cut beets in a tangy plum sauce and it is darn good. Sized to share.The borscht was super salty but otherwise fine. It's very different from Polish/Russian borscht-- different herbs (no dill), very hearty, quite chunky. Not a standout in the summer, but could be nice in cold weather. The vegetarian dumplings are pretty but mostly dough, and only the mushroom filling was interesting. The potato filling was standard (dill was a nice touch), and the cheese filling was really dense and salty. There are a good number of vegetarian and vegan options here, as well as GF dishes. Service is attentive. Weeknights are pretty empty, at least for now, so no reservations are needed. 10% off if you check in on Yelp!",0

I recently enjoyed a visit to a fantastic restaurant that specializes in dried hot pot, and I'm already looking forward to my next meal there. The concept is simple yet brilliant: you choose your ingredients from a counter showcasing a variety of options, pay by weight, and customize the meal for the size of your group, all for roughly $20 per person.

The highlight for me is always the delectably lightly fried fish filet, which has become a staple in my pot. Although there seems to be a hidden limit on the amount of meat you can select (a surprise to my friend who was kindly guided towards the veggies), it's a good nudge towards a balanced dish.

One small critique is the lack of labels for the ingredients. As a newcomer, it can be daunting to distinguish between the meats, especially with a growing line behind you. It would certainly streamline the selection process.

When it comes to spice levels, be aware that the labels might not match your expectations—the ""spicy"" option is only moderately hot, while ""medium"" packs a stronger punch.

Finally, if you're not a fan of peppercorns, be prepared to do some picking as the sauce is generously loaded with them. Despite that, the overall experience is fun, engaging, and satisfyingly delicious. This place is undoubtedly a gem for those who love to personalize their meals.",1
11602,"Title: A Unique and Memorable Dining Adventure

I recently visited this extraordinary restaurant with a group of friends and it was an experience that exceeded all expectations. Our party of five was seated in what they call 'the ship', which turned out to be the best seat in the house, with its unique ambiance setting the perfect tone for our dining adventure.

We embarked on the novel concept of 'fishing' for our dinner, purchasing three fishing licenses to catch our meal. While it's a fun twist, be sure to book an earlier reservation as it took us a good 40 minutes to reel in our selection. The fishing experience provided a mix of challenge and excitement, especially when trying to catch the trickier fish from the lower tanks.

When it came to the starters, I'd recommend skipping the vegetable appetizers as they were the sole veggie options and nothing to write home about. Instead, opt for the mixed sashimi and octopus salad served with a delightful crispy dome – it was a hit at our table.

The restaurant also offers a moderately priced wine list that pairs well with the menu. As for the main event, we decided to have the fish we caught prepared in various ways. The steamed and grilled dishes were spectacular and stood out as our favorites, showcasing the quality of the catch.

I can't praise the staff enough for their friendly and accommodating nature, which added a personal touch to the experience. And don't forget to take some photos – they make for hilarious and lasting memories.

It might be on the pricier side, but this restaurant offers far more than just a meal – it's a complete dining escapade that I would wholeheartedly recommend to anyone looking for something different and delightful.",1
19542,"I recently attended a private event at this restaurant and found the experience to be quite enjoyable. The appetizers, including tasty sliders and succulent meatballs among other small bites, were decent and offered a nice start to the evening. The drink selection was impressive, catering to a variety of tastes. While the service was generally good, there were instances where it took some effort to get the attention of a waitress. The top section of the bar where our event was held became quite crowded, which is something to keep in mind if you're considering a private event here. Overall, a solid choice for casual gatherings with attentive service and a good range of menu options.",1
15571,"I'm still thinking about the food and all the items I wanted to order but forgot to.   I don't even eat meat and still enjoyed everything about this place.   Cleanliness was on point.   The ambiance was perfect for a date, party or hangout, the host were very nice and our waiter was super cool, edgy and accommodating.   Seem like the place was busy but I never felt rushed.   We definitely ordered too much food.",0
20189,"Title: Rediscovering Osteria Morini's Pasta Perfection

In a culinary landscape often captivated by the latest dining hotspots, Osteria Morini remains an understated gem, particularly for pasta aficionados. My recent brunch experience rekindled my appreciation for their masterful pasta creations. The pasta, cooked flawlessly al dente, paired with sincere, attentive service, reaffirmed Morini's place in my palate's pantheon.

The garganelli stands out as a personal favorite; its creamy richness is paradoxically both indulgent and ethereally light—a testament to Chef Michael White's culinary wizardry. For those seeking balance, the misti salad offers a refreshing counterpoint. Its simple vinaigrette drizzled over crisp greens, notably the snappy string beans, provides a delightful burst of acidity to complement the carb-centric main.

In essence, Osteria Morini isn't just maintaining standards but excelling quietly. This is where pasta is both an art and a comfort—effortlessly reminding us why some classics withstand the test of time and trend.",1

14161,"Title: Celebration Dinner with Room for Improvement at 809

Our group chose 809 for a wedding celebration, and upon arrival, we were pleased to find our table ready without delay. The staff took mere minutes to spring into action, and our attentive waiter promptly took our drink orders, serving up a particularly noteworthy happy hour margarita.

Appetizer highlights included the succulent Bollati's de platanos maduros and exquisitely charred octopus. However, our experience was somewhat marred by the cramped seating arrangements, with a table hardly sufficient for the generous plates.

The main courses were a mixed bag. The pescado samana and churrasco were visually appealing, yet the churrasco fell short on its requested doneness, and the lobster in the langosta mofongo was a letdown, lacking in both taste and texture compared to the notably plump shrimp served to another guest.

The standout yucca fries redeemed the meal to an extent, and the restaurant's cooperation with the wedding cake service was commendable. Unfortunately, a lapse in beverage service left me without a follow-up drink offer, an oversight that hinted at inconsistency.

In summary, 809 delivered a pleasant dining experience with a few areas in need of attention, particularly the food execution and drink service, to truly excel.",1
18913,"I would recommend coming here for a quick and cheap (but pretty tasty) meal. The lines aren't too long especially for dinner service.I frequent this location for dinner a few times a month.  I've tried a variety of the dishes including the Liang Pi, cucumbers, dumplings, but my favorite is always the noodles dishes. The hand-pulled noodles are definitely the star of the show here, although I've never tried the cumin lamb bun. Sometimes, however, the vegetable noodle soup is a bit bland.The chain does delivery, however I've only seen their non-noodle soup dishes on the menu. Most times, I come for take-out and the service is pretty quick. There are a few seats along the sides of the restaurant and everything is self-service.",0
10083,"Title: A Delightful Launch at Grill Cafe at the Standard

Review:

Set forth on our urban excursion, Grill Cafe at the Standard proved to be an impeccable starting point. Nestled conveniently for a visit to the Whitney Biennial and the High Line, it welcomed us with open arms. The ambiance struck a chord with its bright, airy aesthetic, charming us into a corner booth without hesitation.

In attendance were my college-bound daughter and my lifelong confidant, David, both equally enchanted by the setting. As the drinks made their appearance, we reveled in the comfort of our surroundings, laughter punctuating the air amidst a series of light-hearted snapshots.

Our appetites found solace in the ample guacamole, teasing our palates with its subtle sweetness, despite the mild greasiness of the accompanying chips—a minor hiccup effortlessly remedied by their prompt service. The Wild Bigeye Tuna Tartare was a culinary epiphany, its pristine freshness delivering a symphony of taste with each morsel.

The Kale Tuscan Caesar emerged as the salad of choice, striking a delicate balance between heartiness and zest. Its flavors were augmented by the genuine anchovies and a surprising garlic crumble that delighted my non-bacon-eating preference.

Grill Cafe is a gem for those seeking a laid-back yet delectable lunch or brunch. With its stellar offerings, it stands as a heartfelt recommendation for anyone's day-starter in the bustling city.",1
11265,"Title: A Mixed Experience with a Delicious Ending

Despite the initial disappointment with service at this bustling eatery, where our party of six encountered several mix-ups with our orders and a less than pristine table setting, the culinary experience ultimately redeemed the night. The staff, possibly overwhelmed or inexperienced, struggled to meet our expectations for attentiveness and accuracy.

However, the food was the star of the show. The vegan burger I had was unparalleled - easily the best I've ever tasted. My companions were equally impressed with their beef burgers, raving about the flavors and quality. The restaurant's atmosphere and overall vibe were lively and inviting.

In conclusion, while the service left much to be desired, the exceptional food has us eager to return, hopeful that our next visit will be smoother from start to finish.",1
21067,"Title: A Brunch to Remember at [Restaurant Name]

I recently visited [Restaurant Name] for brunch, and the experience was nothing short of delightful. The moment the Norwegian Benedict with its succulent salmon landed on the table, it was too tempting to resist – hence no photo, my apologies! Each bite was harmonious, complemented by home fries so savory, they didn't even call for a splash of ketchup.

And then there was the cheesecake. Imagine the silkiest cheesecake you've ever had, but crowned with a creme brulee-esque topping that cracked under the gentle pressure of your spoon—pure bliss.

This place has nailed brunch, and I'm already planning my return for dinner. Take my word for it; [Restaurant Name] is well worth the recommendation.",1

If pork dumplings are what you crave, look no further. This spot serves up some of the best, with skins boasting the perfect thickness and a seasoning that hits all the right notes.

For a hearty meal that provides great value for your money, this restaurant is a must-visit.",1
17746,"I recently dined at a local restaurant where the food and service were impressive.

10012,"Title: Aesthetic Splendor Meets Culinary Precision at Le Jardinier

My recent visit to Le Jardinier left me with mixed feelings. The restaurant is an architectural gem with strong Miami vice vibes, nestled in a building I watched rise from my former workplace nearby. Its beautiful, hotel-like interior is perfumed with Le Labo, creating an ambiance that's undeniably luxurious.

The highlight of my dining experience was, without a doubt, the gluten-free bread. It was exceptional and deserving of more than full marks - a solid 20 out of 10. The accompanying olive oil was equally impressive. 

As for the food, while flavors were vibrant and the presentation meticulous, portion sizes were disappointingly meager. Indulging in dishes like the sumptuous burrata and the well-crafted lobster left me wanting due to their scant servings, especially when considering the hefty price tags.

The vibe of the restaurant was somewhat puzzling. Despite visiting on a bustling Saturday night, the place felt cold and lacked a certain energy I'd expect from such a setting. The staff, including our waiter Andres, was solid and courteous, but there was a missing spark that typically draws guests back to a venue.

In essence, Le Jardinier is a stunning space with very good food. However, it needs to infuse some character and warmth to match its visual appeal and to justify its prices. It's teetering on the edge of greatness but isn't quite there yet, leaning more towards a 3.5 to 4-star experience. Despite my overall dissatisfaction, the bread alone makes it worth a visit, and the restaurant still garners my respect for its achievements.",1
10314,"Stopped in for a quick lunch before heading to the airport. Last meal in NYC before heading home and it did not disappoint.My wife and son shared the trio and a cup of clam chowder and I had the trio and lobster bisque. To me, the best deal on the menu is this combo. You get half a lobster roll, half a crab roll and half a shrimp roll. I can't tell you what order to eat them as they were all very good.There are no fillers and extra stuff to cut down on the meat. It is just pure meat, great seasoning and a buttered and toasted soft roll. There is just enough bread to serve its purpose and you get the full flavor of the meats. I asked for a little mayo and rubbed the amount I wanted on my roll. Finally, the soups. Both the chowder and the bisque were very flavorful. As far as value, I have to say it is pretty pricey. And for the price point here, I don't expect to see as much pincher meat in the lobster. In fact, it should be a rare sighting.I like that they use sustainable and traceable shellfish. All and all, would go back.",0
10344,"I have heard great things about Keste in the Village in Manhattan. I was thrilled when they decided to open another location in downtown Manhattan. This location is pretty hidden. The address states Fulton St, but it is hidden behind bushes and plants and you would have to walk down a side street to enter the restaurant.I have been to Keste several times because they awesome fresh personal pies, but they must be consumed before it gets cold. The chef/owner uses fresh ingredients and native techniques to execute a personal pie like no other. The place also holds pizza making classes and other food events.What is awesome about this place was their $5 personal margherita pie. Here's the catch, to get the discount, this pie must be eaten in the restaurant.If you want to splurge, the truffle pizza aka the Montanara Truffle $20, which has the perfect balance of truffle to mozzarella. Decadent and delightful!!The place also has happy hour until 7pm and they have drink specials and complementary food samples.",0

The ramen was pretty well made in both cases, though I preferred the Tsukemen just a bit more because it was a little more flavorful.The noodles in the tsukemen were well made, with a nice chewy texture and pleasant overall taste, but the broth is really what brought out the greatness of the dish. Flavorful and rich it really goes well with the chewier ramen, blending nicely in your mouth.The shoyu ramen was a bit more mediocre, being more standard fare of what you'd get at other ramen places in the city, but still pretty decent.",0
11004,"I came here for their famous cacio e pepe. Now, when a restaurant names themself after a dish that they offer, you'd expect that it's going to be amazing. Well, at Cacio e Pepe, you'd be right! They bring a large cheese wheel to your table and toss the pasta around in it, right in front of you. We had a great experience and it sounds like such a simple thing but it was fun to watch. The pasta is served al dente which makes sense, as it has to be able to survive being tossed and stirred around without turning mushy. The cheese sauce was very creamy and everything tasted fresh. Even the bread with the tomato paste in oil was delicious. Thank you to the waiter who let me record and take pics while he tossed the pasta at our table.",0
17449,Cozy Space. Dumplings Great. Service on Point. We came here as East Village has so many great spots and this one is known for the Giant XLB. We decided to try the classics. Soup Dumpling. Beef and Pepper Bao. The soup dumplings were great. Nice dough that didn't break when lifting. Filling was tasty. This isn't Flushing Chinatown level but it sure hits the spot. I was less of a fan of the Beef Dumpljngs. But that is more of a personal preference. The beef was not ground enough for my liking and beef in general doesn't hit the spot like Pork does. But again solid choice. Service was so friendly. Even though the space is small they accommodate quite well. If you have an urge for pillows of doughy happiness in EV add this to your bucket list!,0

Please go elsewhere unless you want to support a business that steals from their customers.My husband and I came ~15 min late for our noon reservation.

The chicken tikka masala was a bit on the dry side and the vegetables that came with the thali were room temp bordering on cold. We also ordered a mango lassi ($3) to share which was tasty but when the check came, they charged us $4 for it.Mistakes happen, so we pointed it out to the employee in charge of the front of house. Instead of offering a correction, he told us that he'll ""give us a dollar next time."" ?!What sort of business tries to steal $1 here and there from unsuspecting customers? I'm surprised they're still in operation.On another note, they have two one-person restrooms, which are marked with a small ""M"" and ""W"" (but otherwise indistinguishable). The ""W"" was occupied so I used the ""M"" and upon exiting, an employee accidentally shoved the door into me. Totally okay, but instead of apologizing, he said ""you should have used the women's restroom.""Pippali, you need to train your staff to adhere to NYC law.

My experience at Panca was truly satisfying. Visiting on a post-brunch Sunday when it was less crowded, I found the tranquility perfect as my hunger was quite high. The restaurant's Peruvian offerings did not disappoint, with the ceviche standing out for both its freshness and portion size. To complement, the pisco sours were a delightful treat.

For the main dish, the Aji de Gallina was a creamy concoction that pleased the palate. The advantage of the restaurant being less busy was the prompt service; our waiter was not only friendly but also impressively knowledgeable about the menu.

While Panca may not be a destination that warrants a significant detour, it's a solid choice for those craving Peruvian fare in the W. Village area. It definitely satiated my appetite for non-Mexican Latin cuisine.",1
19677,"If you're ready to venture beyond the usual midtown lunch budget, this sushi haven just might be worth the splurge. Eschewing frugality, I indulged in their winter specials, delighting in the rich flavors of yellowtail and a classic Philly roll. The presence of uni on the menu was a luxury I couldn't pass up.

Navigating their unique plastic wrap system may test your dexterity, but it's a small hurdle in preserving the integrity of their delicate seaweed. The sushi here is a cut above, boasting fresh fish and perfectly seasoned rice, served with traditional soy sauce for an authentic touch. And for those who cherish the details, their naturally colored ginger garnish is a subtle nod to quality.

This spot strikes that elusive balance for sushi enthusiasts: it's a notch above your typical grab-and-go joint, yet it doesn't demand the time and expense of a full omakase experience. It's an ideal choice for those seeking a superior sushi meal without the fuss.",1

It's at the intended location, just one flight down... no biggie.I enter to a warm, earthy smelling aroma that immediately fogged up my glasses. The place smelled like a vegans warm fantasy restaurant, tucked away in the midst of the worst blizzard. Granted tonight was just the usual ""New York City"" cold aka brick but walking into this place was an experience in it of itself.The noise level (music) was at the right level to enjoy ones experience while chatting with a friend between bites. The kitchen, to my right was bustling with attentive chefs who were magically making this medium sized restaurant smell like heaven. I approach the counter and grabbed a menu. My Queen already told me she wanted the Brussel Bowl but due to the poor pics on yelp, I couldn't properly see the menu or decide on what I wanted ahead of time. While I stood there a couple entered behind me so I stepped aside to give them the opportunity to order.Finally I'd decided. I'm was next in line, and after seeing how chummy the cashier was with the previous guests (giving suggestions, asking if they wanted add ons, etc) I was pretty excited about my experience. Unfortunately I didn't get any of that... which was weird because everyone else did. I must note that there were no other customers in there who looked like me (take that as you wish). I placed my order and grabbed a seat near the door so that I could watch the magicians at work in the (open) kitchen. I LOVE open kitchens btw. My glasses had finally defogged at this point  and the customers who ordered after me were already enjoying their meals. They looked beyond happy and I couldn't wait to be there. It seems Uber eats and other food services frequent this place as three of them entered while I waited. So order away (while remaining in your warm homes). Bags were being prepped so I knew mine was almost ready and a brotha was READY. If the food tasted anything like the place smelled then I was in for a treat. Another oddity was the cashier called me over to retrieve my order but the two customers after me had their delivered to their ""waiting"" table... we all had to-go orders. I'm noting this because this was the second service inconsistency that was only awarded to me. All in all, the food measured up to the hype.My Queen enjoyed her Brussel bowl and I went with the açaí protein bowl with granola... I had to ask for granola when other customers were asked if they wanted add ons but I'll let that be.Food: 5/5Ambiance: 5/5Healthy options: 5/5Menu variety: 5/5 (did you see those burgers :-D)Service: 3/5 Overall the place is a 4/5 as there inconsistent service rubbed me the wrong way.

15190,"**MealPal Review: Friendly Pizzeria**

My discovery of Friendly Pizzeria was all thanks to MealPal. For a competitive price of approximately $7 per meal, MealPal offers a convenient way to explore local eateries, and Friendly Pizzeria's Baked Ziti caught my eye.

The restaurant offers a daily MealPal special, and their Baked Ziti did not disappoint. It was generously portioned, perfectly cheesy, and each component was balanced. MealPal's recent update now classifies meals by size, and this one was rightly deemed ""overly filling."" The taste and quantity left me more than satisfied—already looking forward to the next.

While Friendly Pizzeria isn't the place for my usual $1 pizza fix, their offering of a free soda with two slices at $3 each is a decent deal for the Financial District (FiDi).

As for the service, it was outstanding. Despite arriving 45 minutes late for my pickup, the staff went above and beyond by reheating my meal without being prompted. This initiative won them high praise from me.

The restaurant itself is quite small, akin to a miniature Papaya Dog, so it's best suited for pickups rather than dining in.

In conclusion, don't miss out on the Baked Ziti, and kudos to Friendly Pizzeria for making my MealPal experience a great one!

Cailin's Recommendations: Definitely go for the Baked Ziti—and check out the before and after photos to see the abundance of food for yourself!",1
14836,"My experience at Bar Jamon was nothing short of exceptional, especially during their Spanish wine tasting dinner. The tapas served were on par with the finest I've relished in Spain, standing out in quality and taste. While it's common to find decent jamon and patatas bravas at any good tapas place, Bar Jamon eclipses the norm with offerings like their exquisite Confit Goat accompanied by Avocado Queso, Scallion Ash, and Pistachios - a dish that has etched itself in my memory as one of the most delicious meat dishes recently savored.

Echoing the sentiments of the New York Times, it is indeed a challenge to find New York eateries with such consistently pleasing dishes. Bar Jamon masters this with an array of soul-satisfying creations that are a testament to their culinary excellence. Coupled with impeccable service, this dining experience was truly unforgettable.",1

They began by bringing out 2 peoples meals that were cold and had to take it back. We instructed them to wait for everyone's food to be ready and then bring out the food.

12710,"Llama San is fusion gone right. Perhaps you're thinking that mixing Japanese and Peruvian flavors is ill-advised or an impossible feat. Perhaps you're wary but excited about the prospect of potential harmony between two influences. Or perhaps you're already all-in and just want to get your butt into one of these chairs. If you fall into any of these categories (or all, or none, whatever), Llama San is for you. Dining here, you'll find creativity, whimsy, passion and pristine technique on display in every aspect of the dining experience.It's virtually impossible to snag a reservation at Llama San these days. Eater, Infatuation and the New York Times all reviewed it in the last few weeks, so the buzz is spiraling out at record pace. You either need to book very far in advance, or be like me and watch Resy like the most determined of hawks. My company is on the state system, meaning I have Veteran's Day off--which happened to be this past Monday. So all of a sudden, going out on a Sunday night became a viable option. Figuring Sunday would yield better luck than Saturday, I got on the waitlist. And I was rewarded, hurrah! Still, don't count on this. Book early, book often.While I knew that Llama San was in the West Village when I read of its opening, I didn't realize until walking inside that it occupies the space that used to be Tertulia. A strange experience at first, as Tertulia used to be one of my favorite Spanish spots in the city and I was devastated when it closed. Not much has changed -- there's still an open kitchen and two somewhat separate dining spaces. And while the food is obviously different, it is equally -- if not more -- outstanding.First, drinks. Sad to say they were out of their signature Pisco sour on this particular night, which was a big disappointment. It looks special, and obviously other reviewers attest to its excellence. Thankfully, the the cocktail menu as a whole is a force, and there are plenty of other good options. As is the case with the food menu, the cocktail program is an elegant blend of Peruvian and Japanese, impressive and creative with lots of unusual ingredients. I tried the Harajuku is Dead (Milk Punch, Japanese Gin, Butterfly Pea, Verjus), the Veintiuno (Barley Sochu, Amontillado Sherry, Aperol, Walnut, Sudachi, Sesame) and the Flaming Creatures (Japanese Whiskey, Cacao, Chacaca, Miso, Palo Santo Smoke), all of which were delicious. The Harajuku is Dead is dangerous, because it really does just taste like punch, sans alcohol. A beautiful purple color, for the kid inside. The Veintiuno is a take on an Aperol Spritz, good but not mind-blowing. The Flaming Creatures is a perfect nightcap, rich, spirit-forward and grounding. As the name implies, Llama San is Japanese/Peruvian fusion. And my god, do these cuisines fuse well. The process of said fusion is most likely quite challenging, but the Llama San does it masterfully. The marriage is beautiful and unusual, like Judd Apatow and Leslie Mann's. In all seriousness, the feat accomplished here is remarkable. The food is as delicious as it is creative here and it seems hard to take a wrong turn on the menu. Eats, below: Tuna Ceviche, Black Trumpet Mushrooms, Ponzu, Peanuts: AThe ceviches are gold here. Exhibit A: tuna. Fresh and light but full of fun flavors and textures. Impeccably balanced, a perfect starter.Hamachi Tiradito, Uni, Coconut, Matcha: A+When ceviche gets luxury. That foam, that uni. Creamy and rich, as decadent as a crudo can come.Cabbage, Miso, Nori, Anchovy, Quinoa Furikake, Mizuna: A+The bf is anti-anchovy but I promised him (admittedly, without any actual knowledge to back it up) that this wouldn't overwhelm him with anchovy flavor--that it would be balanced out nicely with all of the flavors. That the nori and miso would even things out. Thank god (for both of our sakes) I was right. This was a true masterpiece, seriously powerful and flavorful. So many dazzling elements here, all delicious on their own and combined.Japanese Eggplant, Pine Nut, Huacatay, Fresh Cheese, Grapes: A++Now I was the one to take a risk. I tend to dislike eggplant greatly, despite my love for most veggies. So it was doubly thrilling to receive such an incredible dish. Creative in preparation and presentation, all elements blended together in perfect harmony. The balance of earthy, salty, nutty, sweet and fruity was just divine.Aged Duck Breast Nigiri, Cilantro, Banana, Nasturitum: AOddly didn't wow us as much as the last two veg dishes but still delicious. It's all relative. Extra points for innovative cooking. Another excellent blend of textures and flavors.Chicken Thigh, Aji Amarillo, Walnuts, Olfonso Olive, Nori: A+Oh baby, and what a dish to end on. That amarillo though. It is as amarillo as it comes. Who knew an ingredient could be this vibrant in color *and* in flavor? Almost too pretty to eat, but please do eat it. Two pieces so perfect for sharing. Peruvian flavors adorned with Japanese flair.",0
14348,"Roasted Masala is a gem tucked away at the corner of 105th and Columbus Ave, just a short walk from the 103rd St subway stop. The moment you step into the restaurant, you're welcomed by a staff who are as knowledgeable as they are welcoming, ready to navigate you through a menu rich with Indian culinary treasures.

The ambiance is striking with its sunny yellow highlights, ornate chandeliers, pristine white tablecloths, and regal gold columns. Though a recent addition to the neighborhood, Roasted Masala has already cemented its place with a growing base of loyal patrons.

With a background in hospitality, I've seen many restaurants, but Roasted Masala stands out for its promise. Their culinary craft celebrates the complexity and depth of Indian cuisine—evident in every spice-infused, scratch-made dish that arrives at your table. Each bite is a revelation, underlining the meticulous dedication to authentic flavors.

The menu is a testament to inclusivity with ample choices for vegetarians, vegans, and those with milder palates. During my visit, the experience was nothing short of enlightening, leaving me with a newfound appreciation for Indian cooking and an eagerness to return. Roasted Masala is not just a meal; it's an exploration of flavor that invites you to savor and share. Expect to hear more buzz about this spot—it's definitely on its way to becoming a highlight in New York City's thriving food scene.",1
11131,"Have passed by this place on countless occasions but never gave it a shot.  After eating here, the unanimous consensus was ""Why have we never eaten here before?!""  Admittedly, the menu isn't extensive, but what is on the menu is really well done and wonderful.  The mushroom toast?  An absolute home run.  Burrata cheese over sourdough toast, with the most amazing artichoke and tomato pesto, topped with crimini mushrooms and (optional) a poached egg.  Total game changer.  The nutella french toast was a huge hit, as was the granola/yogurt bowl.  Service was fast, and friendly.  We were surprised how lucky we were to get a table right away (day after Thanksgiving), since there are not that many tables.  Glad we finally tried it and already looking forward to returning!",0
3024,"Title: New Brunch Spot Needs to Find Its Balance

I recently visited a new brunch spot on its inaugural day, eager for a memorable meal but left with mixed feelings. While I hold Llama Inn's brunch in high esteem, this spacious venue, with its understated décor and lush back area, did not quite measure up.

The menu captivates with its fusion dishes, each a creative endeavor with potential. However, the execution needs fine-tuning. My Duck Leg dish, topped with a fried egg and nestled on a mash-like base, fell victim to an overzealous pour of soy sauce, which overwhelmed the dish's complexity with intense saltiness.

My companions enjoyed the Nakayoshi and the Katsu Sando, both harmonious in flavor, yet again the sauce's heavy-handedness on the Sando was a drawback.

Price is another consideration; with entrees like mine reaching $25, the expectation for a well-balanced dish is justified. In this case, excessive saltiness proved a significant letdown. Despite these hiccups, I believe with some adjustments, this brunch spot could yet shine.",1
3259,"Title: A Delightful Lunch Experience

I had the pleasure of dining at this restaurant for lunch and was thoroughly impressed from start to finish. The warm welcome with immediate seating set a positive tone for the visit. Prompt service was a standout, with our attentive waiter taking orders swiftly and another friendly staff member ensuring we had everything we needed.

The lunch special, dry pepper chicken with brown rice, was a fiery delight – a word of caution to those who shy away from intense heat. For beverage enthusiasts, the variety of beers and alcoholic options didn't disappoint.

The ample and comfortable seating arrangement added to the relaxed atmosphere. This establishment definitely earned a repeat visit from me. Highly recommended for those seeking a spicy lunch in a convivial setting.",1
15563,"We were feeling Chinese food but at 6:30 PM on a warm winter Friday night in Chinatown with no reservations, we were out of luck. We headed into Little Italy just to see what was available, and stumbled upon Tiny Shanghai. It's small (10 parties max? maybe?), wedged between tourist shops and Italian restaurants, and easily overlooked but worth a stop in if you're craving Chinese in Little Italy! The food is pretty authentically Chinese (with prices comparable to other restaurants directly in its vicinity) and we were served pretty quickly. We were able to snag the last available table, given the option of hot tea or cold water, and we ordered within 10 minutes of sitting down! We got a pork xiao long bao (soup dumplings) for appetizer, and a shredded pork/bamboo entree as well as a sautéed green bean entree. This is a LOT of food for 2 people, just beware... We both loved the XLB, they were juicy, hot, and their soy sauce-vinegar concoction for the soup dumplings was so aromatic and delicious. The entrees were just okay... I appreciated having bamboo shoots in an entree in a non-Chinatown setting, even though it's close by. Green beans slightly salty but still good. The service was good, prices were fair for the area, and I overall felt like it was worth my money. It was kind of dark, the entrees alright, but overall would be willing to come back again if it came down to it.",0
14442,"I recently visited a local stand-in style restaurant renowned for its tacos, and I must say, they lived up to their reputation. The service was impressively swift, catering to the hustle of taco enthusiasts seamlessly. At approximately $4 each, the tacos not only tantalized my taste buds but also represented a decent value for the price. Should my travels bring me back to this vicinity, a return visit is certainly on the cards.",1
337,"My brother and just date weren't  able to make it to their dinner reservation so he gave me. And man oh man was I glad he did. My friend and I got here a little early so we had a couple of drinks in their very cool bar downstairs. It's a very 90s vibe. When you get there you'll see what I mean. In fact, the prices seem throwback too as they're some of the best I've seen in a Manhattan restaurant. I had an old fashion and while it wasn't one of the best I've had, it wasn't bad either. Usually old fashions are either great or horrible. I of course had the burger. I've been to their sister restaurant, 4 Charles prime rib (I like theirs a little better) and it was similar. The buns and the meat are very soft and you can literally inhale these things. We got the bacon on the side and ended up taking half of it all to go. If you can score yourself a reservation, you won't regret it.",0
10323,"I recently visited this charming local eatery for breakfast and was immediately struck by the diverse clientele, which included office workers, construction workers, and a sprinkling of tourists. Opting for the breakfast platter at an unbeatable price of $5.50, I received a hearty portion that included two eggs, sausage, toast, and home fries. It was a remarkable value. The service was commendably efficient, and I appreciated the convenience of card payment. While the quality of the food was average—unsurprising given the economical price—it was a satisfactory meal in a welcoming atmosphere.",1
15068,"Delicious fresh chicken teriyaki rice bowl for just $8. The bowl comes with pickled carrots,  Chinese broccoli, juicy chunks of chicken teriyaki drizzled with spicy mayo and sesame seeds. The meat is also halal. They also offer the bowl as a salad, tofu teriyaki, and chicken teriyaki with sweet potato fries.",0
1548,"Title: Posh Eats with a Pricey Punch by the Vessel

Upon my recent dining experience at this chic eatery, nestled beside the stunning structure of the Vessel, my best friend and I were immediately captivated by the sumptuous and sensuous interior, complemented by the breathtaking views. The ambiance was elevated by the attentive, suit-clad staff that seemed to glide around with purpose.

Our culinary journey commenced with a plate of grilled vegetables, which were prepared to perfection, offering a delightful start. This was followed by a crabcake that danced tantalizingly on the palate. However, the star of the show was the grilled seabream – fresh, succulent, and expertly butterflied, it was a testament to the restaurant's promising menu selection.

While the flavors were undeniably delicious, we were quickly brought back to reality when the bill arrived—a whopping $180 for a meal that included the aforementioned dishes and a modest club soda. The seabream alone commanded an eye-watering $80, a price infamously reminiscent of the fish's shiny, golden counterparts.

As a side note, I found the bread offerings lacking, especially when considering the pita and dips at Avra, which are a tough act to follow.

In conclusion, if your wallet is prepared to match your appetite for luxury, this restaurant delivers on taste and ambiance. Just be warned: the prices might just linger longer on your mind than the taste of the fish on your tongue.",1
2379,"This is a giant dim sum place. I'm surprised we got in only after 15-20 minutes of waiting as there was a huge line in the lobby and outside the door. Once your number is called, you ride up an escalator to a big banquet room. Since the tables are fairly large, people with less than 8 in their group were seated next to strangers at the same table. The room was packed and we were seated on the stage at the far end of the room. Fun spot for people watching and scouting out all the food options on the carts. You do have to be slightly aggressive watching the food carts and keeping an eye on the dishes you are interested in ordering. The servers all speak Chinese and will mark up your ordering sheet every time you take a dish of food to keep track of everything for billing later. Tbh you will probably feel like you're being eaten alive if you don't speak Chinese or haven't been to a dim sum place before. I did notice, however, they considerately placed non Chinese speaking visitors towards the perimeters of the room so they can efficiently explain to large groups and multiple tables at once how to order and what is on each food cart. They can also conveniently stop their cart as they're explaining without getting too much in people's ways as they're on the edges of the room where there's more space. This place was loud, hectic, and exciting, just as dim sum places should be. Was a fun place to visit during my trip to NYC!",0
17355,"This place is great if you're going alone, but not great if you're coming to chitchat with a buddy. This was my second time going to this location. I can see why this ramen place has gotten so popular. But I can't get over the fact that it's super expensive for their specialty ramen. Oh wells... I went without knowing that a special was happening their for lunar new year week. They gave out 2x points for those that dined and used their loyalty membership. I'll go back when they have another special going on for their members.",0
20616,"Overall, a good place for a drink at the bar and maybe a ceviche or dessert to share, although NOT great for value. Wouldn't get a full meal here again.For drinks, they make decent pisco sours, but I also requested my own custom drink of chicha morada (purple corn drink) and pisco, which was very delicious!Of the appetizers, I got to try the torched salmon ceviche (recommended!), the Japanese curry empanada (not worth $7 for the tiny serving), the mushroom empanada (same), and the crispy potato shrimp (again, overpriced at $18 for 4 pieces of shrimp wrapped in basically deep-fried, grated potato).For my main, I got the Omakase Nikkei Nigiri. The flavors were interesting and well-paired, and they had a good range of different fish/seafood. My only issue was that the uni tasted pretty low quality (the kind you get at AYCE/dollar sushi joints) and definitely not up to par with the price tag.However, dessert was delicious and capped off the night on a high note. I got the sweet potato waffles with a side of banana ice cream, topped with a dark molasses syrup - would just order the dessert alone.",0
10493,"Title: A Promising Find in Midtown – Quality Meets Comfort

My inaugural visit to this spot came on a recommendation from MealPal, and it did not disappoint. The brisket sandwich was a generous serving, thoughtfully presented with coleslaw on the side to prevent a soggy bun situation – a small detail that speaks volumes about their food service. Though the place provided a standard BBQ sauce, I didn't explore if there was a variety; something for my next visit.

On a whim, I added cornbread and sweet potato casserole to my order, both of which were delightful and lived up to the high bar set by the entrée. Pricing felt a bit on the upper end, but that's not unexpected in the midtown area.

The ambiance of the restaurant added to the experience, boasting a charming space that deserves to be bustling. Here's to hoping they weather the pandemic storm – it's a gem that should shine post-corona.",1
17578,"Title: Delicious Surprises at a Busy Eatery

My friend and I learned the hard way that this popular spot demands a reservation. After being turned away with a daunting hour and a half wait, we killed time indulging in dessert elsewhere, which, in hindsight, might have been a blessing in disguise—it saved room for the standout dishes to come.

Upon our return, we dove into a comforting plate of meatballs that were nothing short of fantastic. The accompanying bread proved to be the perfect vessel for savoring every last drop of the flavorful sauce—a highlight my companion couldn't stop praising.

The pizza we ordered was a tale of two halves: one white, the other I admittedly can't recall, but it left an impression of 'salad on a pizza.' Both halves, however, were united by robust and satisfying flavors. As someone who doesn't typically gravitate towards pizza, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed their spin on it.

In short, make a reservation to avoid a wait and go for the meatballs and pizza—you won't regret it!",1
17478,"My wife and I escaped our usual Harlem/UWS routine for a much-needed date night in Tribeca and stumbled upon this modern yet cozy gem. With a reservation, we were swiftly ushered to a charming booth, setting the stage for the culinary delight that awaited us.

The evening commenced with brussel sprouts that lived up to their reputation as a chef's darling – a year-round staple whose rich, smoky flavor married beautifully with the tang of apple cider. Alongside, the fluke carpaccio presented a symphony of freshness, the passion fruit, and green olives accentuating the fish to a sublime degree.

The main courses furthered our gastronomic journey. My wife's spaghetti alla chitarra, enriched with soy egg yolk and adorned with forest mushrooms, was a textural masterpiece I couldn't resist sampling. My choice, the aged Long Island duck, was a revelation with its impeccably crisp skin atop a bed of spicy fermented chili and dirty rice – a dish that captivated my palate with its perfect medium-rare succulence.

Every dish delighted us with its meticulously crafted presentation and explosion of flavors. This place has secured a spot on our list for a return visit next season, eager to see what new tastes await.",1
14504,"Title: A Delightful Surprise at [Name of Pizza Joint]

Rating: ★★★★★

Our group of eight ventured to this pizza haven for a Saturday lunch and were quickly accommodated with a spacious table. We eagerly sampled a variety of personal square pizzas, including classic cheese, the vegetable-rich Vendura, the unique Sotto Sopra, hearty Ditta, and the spicy Diavolo. Each pizza boasted a light yet satisfying crust, paired with either a punchy red sauce or a flavorful pesto, all perfectly baked to golden-brown excellence.

The standout experience didn’t stop with the food. We indulged in the weekend happy hour treats - house wines and pilsners for just $5. The staff impressed us with their friendly and efficient service, deftly managing our large party’s requests.

In summary, this pizza joint is a must-visit for its speedy service, exceptional pizzas, and fantastic deals. I highly recommend it for both groups and individual diners looking for quality eats.",1
12224,"Title: A Taco Haven in Chelsea's Market

If tacos are your love language, then this gem in Chelsea's Market will have your heart skipping a beat. Not only is it my top taco destination in the city, but its reputation is clearly echoed in the ever-present line—a testament to scrumptiousness awaiting within. Don't let the queue daunt you; it's a fast-moving testament to the efficient and hardworking staff.

The prices are more than fair, especially considering the added bonus of choosing from a variety of soft drinks in quaint glass bottles. But let's taco 'bout the main event: these authentic beauties are nothing short of a flavor fiesta, generously filled and perfectly seasoned. And for those with a gluten aversion or the culinary curious, do inquire about the off-menu queso shell—it's a cheesy twist that does not disappoint (note: an additional cost may apply).

Don't skip the mini salsa bar; it's a self-serve splash of customization on your already delectable plate. It's no wonder I'm ecstatic about their new spot closer to the Port Authority. This taco joint is truly a cut above the rest!",1

13131,This is good Chinese food for a great price in NYC.Price: Look to spend about $4 for 8pc dumpling and $7 for dan dan mien (minced pork dry noodles). You also have to pay for bottled water.Food: The dumplings were very good filled with pork and vegetables. The best sauce for this is the chili oil and black vinegar. The dan dan mian was topped with bok choy and tasty when mixed with the minced pork sauce.Service: typically authentic chinese resturant service. Quick and snappy. I would come here again. One of the least expensive yet tasty places in NYC.,0
3313,"During a recent visit to Chelsea Market, I decided to grab a milkshake at one of the food stops. There was a brief 5-10 minute wait, which is palatable for the area, but I couldn't help noticing the price seemed steep for the modest serving size. The milkshake itself was enjoyable, but the combination of the wait, cost, and small quantity left me with a feeling of dissatisfaction. My friends opted for boozy shakes, which they reported to be delicious, yet they echoed my sentiment regarding the size-to-cost ratio. While the flavors were commendable, it's unlikely we would return given the overall value proposition.",1

I'm so picky about Mac & Cheese that I'll rarely order it when out. Does anyone like that neon sludge like you had in grade school that's mostly wax? No. So get this one instead. So much delicious cheese flavor. It reminds me of homemade. My dad had the burger where they being the cheese wheel out and pour it over the burger.

12193,"Title: A Slice of Pizza Perfection in NYC

If you're hunting for an exceptional pizza experience in the heart of New York City, look no further – this pizzeria is the hidden gem you've been dreaming of. Offering a casual vibe perfect for snagging a quick slice, their customer service is top-notch and sets the stage for what's bound to be more than just a meal; it's a culinary delight.

As a regular patron, I've watched this eatery evolve into my go-to spot, often visiting more than my waistline would care to admit. There's a unique charm here, characterized by friendly staff, toe-tapping music, and an atmosphere that invites you back time and time again.

Gone are the days of languishing in the seemingly endless queues at Prince Street Pizza, as this pizzeria serves up slices that rival or surpass the famed establishment – without the wait. Skeptical about the few negative reviews? It's simple: those who know, know this place is the real deal.

Diving into their menu, the grandma slice, a newfound favorite of mine, is a testament to their prowess. Its thin yet impeccably crisp crust, coupled with a sweet tomato sauce and just the right touch of pesto, has me hooked. For those who prefer indulgence, the white slice with its symphony of cheesy, garlicky, and sweet honey notes is nothing short of sublime.

While I miss their eggplant parm, the shift towards more vegan options, including a revamped vegan version sans cheese, is commendable. Their pepperoni, steeped in history as the original recipe for PSP's pepperoni square, now shines even brighter here with a dough and crust that are airy, fluffy, and crisped to perfection.

Yes, you might pay a little more than your average dollar slice joint, but what you get in return is unparalleled quality – a true reflection of their ingredient-driven ethos.

In short, this pizzeria is more than worth the visit. It's a place I hope continues to thrive, as it's become an essential chapter in my ongoing love affair with great pizza.",1
15450,I will confess that I'm an avid fan of Frank's restaurants. Supper is for sure no exception. The pasta quality is just so good and I love how homey and unpretentious the vibe is.

17069,"Popped in here for a ""duck and run"" as part of a Chinatown food crawl and it did not disappoint. Peking Duck house is a higher end venue for Chinatown dining, with white linen tablecloths and a more formal feel throughout than you typically find down here. The Peking duck here is excellent - short and simple. And why wouldn't it be, they serve between 80 and 100 of them per day. Think about that for a second, 80 ducks x 365 days a year = a LOT of Ducks!  We talked to our chef who was carving the bird and figured out he had cooked and sliced about 200,000 birds in his tenure. Just watching him carve was an experience - dude is an artist with a bird and a knife. The skin was crispy and crackled with every bite. The duck was cook perfectly, a little fatty which makes for a super juicy bird. The scallions and cucumber added nice texture, the hoisin (and mustard) give a sweetness and kick to every bite. If you're seeking out an upscale meal on Mott street, this place should absolutely be on your short list.",0
18704,"Title: Cozy Spot with a Side of Confusion

My recent visit to this charming local eatery delivered a rather mixed bag. While it advertises as BYOB – and indeed, our waiter confirmed they do not serve alcohol – we noticed a few patrons sipping what appeared to be restaurant-provided spirits. Puzzling, to say the least.

We shrugged it off and grabbed a bottle of Cabernet from a nearby shop. The establishment was accommodating with glasses, which smoothed over the initial hiccup. The real highlight, however, was the food: the chicken Adana was exceptional and comes highly recommended. My companion, though a fan of lamb, found her yogurt lamb Adana less to her liking.

Despite the beverage confusion, the overall atmosphere was inviting and the culinary offerings (mostly) delightful. A worthy visit for the food and local charm, just clarify the drink situation beforehand.",1

12718,"Title: A Cozy East Village Gem with a Delectable Tasting Menu

I recently had the pleasure of dining at a wonderful little restaurant tucked away in the East Village, and I'm already looking forward to my next visit. The restaurant offers a fantastic tasting menu that's perfect for an evening when you're not rushed and can savor a decontracted atmosphere. Opting for the ""long"" tasting menu, we were seated at the bar for a 6pm start and had the added entertainment of watching each dish come to life before us.

For those preferring a more concise dining experience, there's also a shorter and more economical menu available at the tables. Despite indulging in all 10 plates, the portion sizes were well-balanced, ensuring we left satisfied without feeling overstuffed. Each dish was expertly prepared and a real treat to the palate, though I wish there had been a standout moment that truly wowed us. Some sauces, particularly the one accompanying the sweetbreads, were a tad overpowering and masked the dish's natural flavors.

Among the offerings, Luthuj was a highlight that I thoroughly enjoyed, even if it didn't quite hit the ""wow"" factor I anticipated. Nevertheless, the restaurant’s charm and the quality of the food make it worth a detour. Don't forget, it's BYOB for now, so you can bring along your favorite wine to complement the meal.

15000,"Title: A Bittersweet Farewell to a Culinary Gem

I had long anticipated dining at this local favorite, so when I learned of its imminent closure, I hastened to visit. Arriving just before they opened on a Tuesday evening, I was greeted by a queue that spilled onto the sidewalk – a testament to the restaurant's beloved status.

Securing a table adjacent to the bustling open kitchen, I commenced with 'The Flats,' a mezcal concoction that did not disappoint. The highlight, JW Chicken, lived up to its acclaim – succulent and worth every cent of its $29 price tag; it was a dish I savored both that evening and as leftovers. Accompanying gnocchi, while not as tender as anticipated, were nevertheless outstanding.

The opportunity to express my appreciation to Chef Waxman was the icing on the cake – his graciousness in receiving praise made the visit all the more memorable. Eager for one last taste before the doors close for good, I am already planning my return. A true culinary treasure, this establishment will be sorely missed.",1
17808,"Title: A Mighty Catch Worth Every Penny!

My Sunday lunch experience at a new seafood spot was an absolute delight. Opting for the Mighty Catch Combo at $59, I was served a generous spread of fresh seafood including 1Lb each of snow crab, headless shrimp, crawfish, and little neck clams, along with corn and red potatoes. The mighty sauce with medium spice was the star of the meal—flavorful with just enough heat to enhance the Cajun seasoning without overpowering the palate.

The size of the clams and shrimp exceeded my expectations, and the snow crabs were exceptional. The potatoes, which I’d typically ignore, became irresistible, drenched in that delicious sauce. A complimentary apple juice from Yelp check-in complemented the meal perfectly, offering a refreshing break from the richness of the food.

Sharing the combo with my boyfriend, who's quite the eater, the portion size was more than satisfactory. Considering the quality of the food, friendly staff, and the clean, spacious interior of this new establishment near Columbia University, the price feels justified. A spot I'd recommend, especially to the student crowds seeking a decadent treat!",1
20686,"I recently visited a local restaurant and found it to be a pleasant experience overall, though it did not quite live up to the expectations set by its pricing. While the food quality was good, it did not stand out as exceptional, particularly considering the cost which leaned towards the higher end of the spectrum.

The establishment shines during its happy hour, available between 5-7 PM, offering a variety of drinks priced between $7-8 alongside an assortment of appetizers. However, the portions of these happy hour specials were hit or miss. The lobster roll, for example, was disappointingly small, suitable for just one person, in stark contrast to the more generous serving of the shareable calamari.

The taste of both the lobster roll and calamari was satisfactory, but given they didn't quite hit the mark of culinary excellence, the prices seemed less justified. Despite the lively happy hour, due to the combination of good but not great food and the higher price point, I am hesitant to return.",1
18953,"Really enjoyed my time here! The atmosphere is very cozy and felt I felt the warmth immediately upon entering. The drink options were good as well - average prices and a good selection. The dinner menu is more upscale with some items being a bit pricey. I ordered the bucatini all bottarga and it was AMAZING, I ate every bite. The homemade pasta was thick and flavorful. I will definitely be back here again!",0
3616,"I stumbled upon Dun Huang while scouring Seamless for a soup fix, and their solid reputation nudged me to order. The Traditional Lanzhou Beef Noodles caught my eye, and at $10, the value was undeniable. The dish was a satisfying feast of wide, hand-pulled noodles swimming in a rich beef broth, accentuated by tender beef slices and a fresh garnish of cilantro and radish. Generous in portion and robust in taste, with a delightful hint of spice, it surpassed my expectations. Dun Huang nails it for those in search of authentic, hearty beef noodle soup without breaking the bank. Highly recommended!",1
1364,"We arrived when they first opened, and service was slow. They advertise that we could order from the menu but kept pushing the buffet. Finally our servers decided that we could order from the menu. I had the tomato soup with about five croutons, and my friends had Butter Chicken and some sort of lamb. They both enjoyed their dishes. Also, we had the Naan Garlic Bread and it was deliciousOverall, it was a good experience but the service could be better. The customer service was good but the servers seemed confused. If you enjoy Indian food and not in a hurry, I would recommend this restaurant. The decor was pretty emerald green.",0

I visited this bustling eatery just after 11am on a Monday, hoping to skip the typical lunch rush. Despite the crowd, my friends and I secured a table immediately. The ambiance was lively, with a seating arrangement designed to maximize capacity—expect to rub elbows with your neighbors, but that's part of the charm.

The service shone just as brightly as the convivial atmosphere, with attentive staff ensuring a pleasant experience. As for the food, my rose water waffles were nothing short of delightful, and the Mediterranean breakfast across the table from me looked equally tempting. That said, the $13 price tag for the waffle felt a tad steep relative to the fare's quality.

In all, this spot nails the essence of a great brunch/lunch destination for those looking to indulge in a midday treat amidst a vibrant setting.",1

I went with a frozen guava margarita my friend a frozen strawberry margarita. We both enjoyed our drinks, definitely didn't skimp on the alcohol *but I did have a headache later, not sure of the alcohol used for HH drinks*.I also had a Super Burro Relleno with steak *I wasn't impressed, it consisted of more beans than anything, very little steak*. My friend had chicken quesadillas which she raved about. She also asked for more sour cream *which turns out to be an additional $2, not told to us by the waiter but appeared on our bill.

14606,"Title: A Thursday to Remember at Thursday Kitchen

If Korean fusion is what you're after, then Thursday Kitchen in the East Village is your spot. The buzz around this place is real – expect a queue, especially on weekends, but their nearby waiting area eases the wait with a cool ambiance and some drinks.

Once inside, you're greeted with an explosion of flavors, but I must tip my hat to the edamame dumplings – a melt-in-your-mouth wonder with a truffle-edamame mash-up that's just divine. The paella is another showstopper, boasting freshness with a playful kimchee kick. Opt for the bar seating; the bartender ensures you're well taken care of amidst the hustle, and a $20 sake bottle pours generously for two.

The cherry on top is their dish debriefing, a thoughtful touch that adds to the overall dining experience. Thursday Kitchen nails it on both flavor and service fronts. Highly recommended!",1
13976,"My friend and I had dinner at Rosie's on Friday night at around 8pm. We didn't have a reservation, but were lucky to have been able to get two seats despite the restaurant being super crowded. We shared guac and chips as well as a margarita pitcher. The margarita pitcher filled about 5-6 glasses and we were able to finish it between the two of us. It was definitely strong though! I also had the ground beef taco (pretty average), beer-battered cod taco (my favorite of the three), and chorizo taco (a little on the dry side).

19517,"Title: Hidden Culinary Treasure in Midtown

Finding a dining spot in Midtown that surprises you is a rare delight, but this restaurant manages to do just that. A recent dinner experience here, alongside three friends, left us all remarkably satisfied with plentiful leftovers to boot.

We navigated through their menu which offers an adventurous variety of dishes. The mapo tofu, donning three chili signs, packed an impressive punch of flavor without an overwhelming spiciness. It's a dish I would recommend for its perfect balance of sauce and heat.

The eggplant and pork special was a deep-fried wonder, arriving with a duo of dipping sauces. The standout was the sweet and sour — a perfect companion to the dish. Our table also shared the BBQ fish, which was generous in portion and rich in flavor, with meat that easily flaked away with a fork.

But the Peking duck was the true star of the evening. It's a dish I'm usually skeptical about due to past dryness, but here, it was tender and juicy. The skin cracked delightfully with each bite, and the flavors were exceptional — rich without relying on thick layers of fat.

The restaurant space is expansive, spread over two floors, making it an ideal spot for large groups. All in all, this establishment is a testament to culinary excellence, and I eagerly anticipate my next visit.",1
18147,"I visited a local restaurant at 11 AM on Sunday and faced a reasonable 25-minute wait. The culinary experience was highlighted by 4 unique rice rolls and 3 different porridges. Rice rolls R1 and R2 stood out, offering an unconventional take on the classic dim sum dish with all ingredients enclosed within the roll. These were delicious, albeit progressively saltier with each bite, likely attributable to the soy sauce absorption. As for the porridges, the shrimp variety captured my taste buds with its impressively large shrimp. However, the fried fish skin was unremarkable, reminding me of generic market-bought snacks. Overall, a worthwhile visit for the rice rolls and shrimp porridge.",1

14816,"Upon arriving at the bustling pizzeria, which was to be expected given our group's indecision on preordering, we found ourselves amidst a queue. A patient 15-20 minute wait yielded five savory slices. The standout without a doubt was the classic square pepperoni slice—delightfully spiced pepperoni capturing the limelight. Though the crust leaned on the thick and doughy side for my taste, it's easy to see why many are drawn to it. The vodka sauce slice, however, lacked distinction and failed to impress, making it a choice I'd forgo in the future. On a brighter note, the margarita slice received an approving nod from my companion.",1
19917,"Title: Cozy Breakfast Experience with a Hefty Price Tag

I recently stopped by this charmingly rustic cafe for breakfast and found the atmosphere to be quite pleasant, perfect for a relaxed meal. Opting for the classic eggs, bacon, and toast, along with a specialty latte, I found the food to be served promptly, with the eggs cooked just right to my over-medium preference. The coffee was decent, though not particularly remarkable.

While the quality of the meal was satisfactory, the prices seemed to be on the higher side, which seems to be somewhat expected in this part of town, aligning with nearby hotel breakfast costs. Despite the price, the cleanliness of the place and the efficient service contributed to a positive dining experience.

Seated near the entrance, I had the opportunity to engage in a bit of people-watching, which added an enjoyable element to my visit. Overall, while the experience was satisfactory, the cost might give one pause before making a return visit.",1

With a variety of food offerings and a prominent central bar, the ambiance is refreshingly inviting. A notable addition is the elegant champagne bar near the entrance, which adds a touch of sophistication to the experience. The only drawback is the limited warmth within the space, a minor compromise due to the structure's design. Had it been a tad cozier, this delightful venue would be worthy of a solid four-star rating.",1
11490,"Title: A Playful Cantonese Treat in the Upper East Side

My dining group and I recently had the pleasure of experiencing a Cantonese feast at a delightful spot on the Upper East Side. The restaurant's charming pig-themed decor, complete with piggy charms dangling from some menus, set a fun tone for the evening.

The service stood out, with friendly and knowledgeable servers guiding our culinary journey. The roast pork ribs were the star of the show for me; they were succulent, massive, and coated in a sticky sweet glaze that elevated them beyond your typical Chinatown fare. Another highlight was the seared scallops, which achieved a perfect balance with a crunchy top and tender middle.

We appreciated the unique twist on some dishes, like the unconventional yet tasty deep-fried Brussels sprouts, and the 'Pig Heaven'—a heavenly mix of tangy orange flavors with crispy pork shreds that was both sweet and spicy.

The flounder with ginger and scallion showcased chunky fillets doused in a flavorful soy and ginger sauce, and while the beef with asparagus and mushroom was passable, it lacked traditional Cantonese essence. The pork belly sparked debate; it was a hit or miss among us, especially when compared to more authentic Taiwanese versions.

The only letdown was the tofu with seasonal vegetables, which was forgettable and won't make it to our future orders.

In summary, this restaurant is a solid Cantonese eatery with a whimsical twist, offering a mostly delightful array of dishes that are well worth a try for anyone in the neighborhood.",1
13941,"Title: Quick Thai Fix on Wheels!

I recently joined a friend for a spontaneous lunch at the Thai Mis Delicias truck, and what a delightful surprise it turned out to be! Run by a friendly family, the service had a personal touch, highlighted by a young boy who cheerfully took our orders.

I indulged in the Tofu & Vegetables Pad See Ew, priced fairly at $11 (before tax), and was rewarded with a dish where the noodles shone – perfectly chewy and expertly cooked. The vegetables, particularly the broccoli, soaked in a savory sauce, were cut to just the right size, making each bite effortless and enjoyable.

The only snag in an otherwise tasty experience was the tofu, which was slightly disappointing due to its dry and crumbly texture. But don't be deterred – the generous portion size ensured I left satisfied despite not finishing the tofu.

While not the largest meal for the price and one might find a better deal with a lunch special at a traditional Thai restaurant, for those looking for a quick Thai meal on the go, Thai Mis Delicias does the trick with speed and flavor!",1

Don't let the modest size of this dining spot deter you; the wait is a testament to its popularity and the staff orchestrates seating with admirable efficiency. Once nestled in, my choice of basil udon with beef offered a delightful twist to the usual Thai fare – a fusion that didn't disappoint in taste and certainly satisfied in portion. Meanwhile, the top Thai curry leaned towards the sweeter end of the spectrum, a pleasant surprise for those with a penchant for gentler spices. The meal was perfectly rounded off by their taro custard, a unique dessert that stands out from the common offerings. In summary, this place is a charming find for anyone looking to indulge in Thai flavors with a twist.",1

The star of the show, though, is their Tres Leches French toast—a decadent masterpiece with maple, agave nectar, tart lime berries, and whipped cinnamon butter that's absolutely divine.

20810,"Title: A Timeless Culinary Gem Steeped in Hollywood History

Nestled in a corner that whispers tales from 1944, this enchanting eatery seems to hold the secrets of Hollywood's golden era within its walls. A former haunt of Frank Sinatra, the restaurant wears its history proudly, with countless photos of celebrity patrons serving as a testament to its long-standing allure.

Upon entering, one can't help but feel the embrace of old-school charm. My recent visit only confirmed the well-deserved reputation of this legendary establishment. The meal was a delectable journey back in time, beginning with a baked clams oreganata appetizer that set the bar high for what was to follow. And indeed, the main courses—a clams over al dente linguini and the tender veal meatballs with spaghetti—were nothing short of sublime, each dish a best-in-class rendition that would be hard to surpass anywhere else.

Admittedly, the prices do reflect the quality and legacy, with the wine offerings leaning towards the extravagant. Yet, for those special occasions, the splurge is unequivocally justified. Complementing the sumptuous fare, the service provided by our waiter and the bar server was the epitome of professionalism and warmth.

In sum, this restaurant isn't just a meal but an experience—a rare concoction of nostalgia, culinary excellence, and impeccable service that truly stands the test of time.",1
18582,"This new Mediterranean restaurant by city College is a great addition to the neighborhood. So far, I've only tried the falafel sandwich but it's blown my mind away. I plan on trying all of their platter and sandwich options because the falafel was just so good.They have a homemade to white sauce that they put in every sandwich. The vegetables in the falafel sandwich, especially the onions, gave it so much flavor. The falafel sandwich was somewhere around 9.50. It is more expensive than a falafel from the cart but it's also 100 times tastier and worth the extra three dollars.There's a lot of seating in this restaurant. Even though it's more of a take-out spot, if you want to come here and relax and enjoy your meal, you could. Unfortunately, they aren't open on Saturday and Sunday so it's more of a lunch place during the work week.Overall, they have very delicious options and is definitely worth a shot if you go to school in the area and need a quick lunch or if you live nearby.",0

The group agreed that the Banh Xeo and Grilled Pork Jowl were our favorites. The Banh Xeo was much thicker and crispier than those I've had previously and I loved it. The Brussels Sprouts with the Grilled Pork Jowl were phenomenal.Some were not fans of the Sizzling Sisig, but I really enjoyed it. I loved that it came with an egg still cooking as it arrived.

They also took care of our soup. Tang soup is not your typical watered down Hotpot. Their broth is top notch full flavored. It's good to have a Hotpot restaurant that can provide authentic mala for people like me that chases that flavor. I also notice they changed their portions of the food they served. Nothing was small. Big portions and quality was on point. This is how improvements should be made. I also got a change to speak with their manager Li, and I did mention what happened to me when I came here first time. He did apologize and said that case was put into careful consideration and improvements have been made. Way to go!!! Good job  because it was definitely noticeable. All the servers were very friendly. Plates were changed all the time, water or sauce was refilled. We also did not get rushed, since this is not AYCE, and we keep adding to our order. Top notch service and everyone on point. This is how to keep improving and having customers come back. I will definitely recommend!!! 5",0

Holy moly it was good!!!! The pork tenderloin app was unreal. And oh my god my skirt steak was mouth watering. Literally, ate the whole damn thing! Wowza! The servers are friendly.

The staff were the epitome of sweetness, contributing to an atmosphere that felt just perfect, enhanced by tastefully chosen decor that resonates with the restaurant's unique charm.

Situated in an unassuming location, this little gem offers a surprise with its delightful dining experience. The food was a highlight, particularly the way it's served on trays, allowing for a mix-and-match feast of dips and accompaniments with bread or rice. A set menu concept adds to the intrigue, bringing dishes to the table that are both unexpected and delectable.

The appetizer sauces were standouts—three distinct flavors that somehow harmonized beautifully on the palate. Their recipe is a closely-guarded secret, I presume, but the result is nothing short of culinary magic.

Each bite of the freshly cooked meats, prepared right before your eyes, was a testament to the care put into their dishes. The tacos, adorned simply with cilantro, onions, and zesty lime slices, were a delight – no need for additional toppings when the basics are done right.

The complimentary salsas at the salsa station are a perfect touch, especially the tomatillo salsa, which stood out with its refreshing taste. Beyond the food, the staff deserve a shoutout for being exceptionally friendly, contributing to a warm dining experience.

Rating: ★★★½☆

Despite its popularity on a bustling Tuesday evening, my recent dining experience at this local ramen spot was underwhelming. While I opted for the Minca Sio Ramen and my partner chose the Shoyu Ramen, both of us found the broths excessively salty for our palates. The texture of the noodles also missed the mark, presenting a chewiness that suggested they were undercooked according to our preferences. The salted egg included was overly seasoned and, regrettably, inedible for me. It's a letdown given the rave reviews we'd seen, but it seems this visit didn't live up to the hype.",1
11763,"A friend was coming to town and wanted to meet up with a bunch of us in NYC. I was able to reserve on Open Table for a large group without putting a credit card down, which was great and unusual for a restaurant in NYC! I see some reviews on here for Restaurant Week--people, why do that when you can do their ""Park Avenue Wine Dinner"" which is available EVERY day after 8:30pm? If you are going to drink at all this is a great value: appetizer, entree & dessert plus unlimited pour of 4 different wines, for $69! The restaurant is so beautiful, service was friendly and most of the food we all got was really great. They started us out with complimentary delicious corn bread & sticks of watermelon cutely designed to look like a flowering potted plant. I got the truffle gnocchi app which I thought was a little bland, though I loved that they shaved the black truffle over it right at the table. I wish I'd gotten the burrata with grilled peaches app or the strawberry-watermelon-avocado gazpacho (which my friend loved) instead. My chicken entree came cut into little medallions along with eggplant cut the same way--interesting presentation & tasty. The 5 friends I was with all enjoyed their apps & entrees. The wines--they started us off with prosecco, then came a wonderfully refreshing white wine, then a red wine (I don't usually like red, but I did like this one well enough), and a nice rose to finish it off. For dessert, instead of asking each of us to choose one, they brought out what seemed to be ALL the desserts! I can tell you none of us was complaining as we dug into everything! My personal favorite was the strawberry-grapefruit gelato (which surprised me, as I'm usually not a fan of grapefruit) and this strawberry mousse-y dessert. And the mint chip ice-cream you could taste was made with real mint! My friend from out of town just loved the pineapple creme brulee. We were all enjoying ourselves and shut the place down for the night. Only downside: it was an extremely hot day and the a/c was not at all adequate. All of us were sweating buckets, not ideal when dressed up for a fancy dinner! But I want to come back next season to try the next seasonal menu! And the season after that, and the season after that...later on I found out from my coworkers that they've all been here too and loved it. Definitely recommend.",0
10373,"Perusing St. Mark for a post-dinner chill spot, my friends and I ended up at Boka. On a Friday night, there were many people trying to get in and out of the place. However, we were very quickly seated; there were ample tables inside.I was first very surprised by how modern and pretty the decor inside was. The black brick walls matched well with the unique light bulbs on the ceiling. There was a bar area with counter seatings and booth areas for larger parties. The place was bustling with customers and active staffs.We got 2 mixed sojus to share, mango and lychee. The Mango soju was rather diluted and didn't taste much different from straight soju. On the other hand, the lychee was delightful, sweet and fresh.Although we have already had dinner, we couldn't resist the aromatic fried chicken smell that permeated the whole place because every table seemed to order it. We got a Medium Combo Platter with 6 wings and 3 thighs. They also let us do a mix between Sweet Spicy and Garlic. The chickens were amazing, soft and juicy on the inside and flavorful and crispy on the outside.With solid food, drinks, and atmosphere that let you hold proper conversation, Boka is a great spot for friends to hangout late into the night.",0

We opted for the lunch nigiri omakase for $55 which comes with miso soup, 6 pieces of nigiri, one maki, and dessert. There are a few other options that include more pieces but are more expensive.The sushi chefs were great and I enjoyed talking to them throughout the meal. However, the downside of the lunch nigiri omakase was that while the pieces were prepared fresh in front of us, they were served in 2 sets of 3 pieces rather than one by one, which definitely took away from the omakase experience. The pieces themselves were fresh and tasty, but after we had finished the 6 we were still pretty hungry. For the maki roll you got a choice and we opted for the tuna. I was underwhelmed by the hand roll and feel it could have been more flavorful. Lastly, the dessert was a highlight - a mango sorbet with red bean that was a lovely bite. When we finished the set, we were still pretty hungry and ended up ordering 2 additional pieces. But they did not provide us a menu (or with prices) and while they were also quite good, it ended up being ~$15 per piece. In addition, we were charged a service tax without being informed by our server. It was unclear to us that any additional gratuity was then optional. Our bill for a relatively limited lunch came out to a whopping $120. For this reason, I'm unable to give Kissaki more than 3 stars. While the fish was fresh and the experience enjoyable, I really don't think this was worth the value with so many other fantastic omakase restaurants in the city.",0

I recently dined at an absolutely adorable spot that epitomizes summer vibes in every corner, complete with stunning decor and a refreshing lemony scent I adored. My visit coincided with restaurant week, allowing me to indulge in their 2 course lunch meal — a true bargain at $26.

The meal kicked off with a delightful surprise of complimentary cornbread that was the epitome of moist and dense perfection. For starters, I enjoyed the burrata salad, a harmonious blend of fresh tomatoes, grilled peaches, and creamy burrata — though I'd suggest passing on the accompanying bread, as it was distractingly crunchy.

The main course highlight was the highly recommended branzino, and it did not disappoint. The fish's skin was seasoned to a crisp, enveloping the freshest fish. Paired with a fregula (pasta) tossed with artichokes and olives, the dish was remarkable — and from someone who isn't an olive fan, that says a lot. 

For those seeking a taste of summer with every bite, this restaurant is a must-visit, especially during restaurant week.",1

We came back like less than 2 hours later for Round 2, no joke.The move is: Adobada tacos, corn tortilla, con todo (with everything: guac, cilantro, onions, salsa)Round 1, we got 2 carne asada tacos ($3.95/each), 2 of the highly esteemed adobada tacos ($3.75/each) and a Sidral (Mexican apple soda - $3.75). Wow not only are the adobada ones cheaper but also better! I started with the carne asada ones and was VERY impressed but when I got to the adobada, I was BLOWN AWAY. Soooo tasty - the flavors and textures are so balanced and perfect, and it tastes authentic af. A little messy to eat but so very worth it. We then went over to Miznon because we also wanted to try their Folded Cheeseburger (yelp.com/biz/miznon-new-… )... After stuffing ourselves with that and a stroll around the market later, we found ourselves back on the Los Tacos line once again. Oops?Round 2 was ALL about the adobada. The marinated pork, the al pastor... just out of this world. We got 4 of them this time + a fresh horchata ($3.75) to share.

15634,"There are probably better Mexican places out there, but the general location and wide availability of outdoor seating at the Dos Caminos in Meatpacking make it a solid choice for either lunch/brunch or dinner while in the area. The wait times here for a table are usually very reasonable, even during peak hours on weekends without reservations (I'd still recommend reservations here though, especially for larger groups). Food also comes out quickly, and service has been relatively consistent the times I've come here.The guacamole here is good, although I've had better guac elsewhere. Nevertheless, what gets me to come back again and again is my go-to dish, the Bocadito Trio! I've probably ordered it every single time I've been here! Technically an appetizer, the Bocadito Trio comes with enough food that I usually order it as my entree. The dish consists of 2 chicken taquitos, 2 corn empanadas, and 2 plantain empanadas. All 3 parts of the dish are delicious, but the highlight for me are the plantain empanadas! The slight sweetness and soft texture of the plantains complements the savory flavors and crispy textures of the chicken taquitos and corn empanadas. One of my favorite dishes of any restaurant, anywhere!As this restaurant is located in the Meatpacking district, expect a bit of a rowdy crowd when here in the evenings/peak weekend brunch hours. When the weather is nice, I'd recommend the outdoor seating, which is perfect for people watching!",0
1086,Had an amazing outing with co-workers at this gem of a restaurant! A shoutout to Sherly & Pedro for elevating our experience with their infectious cheer and top-notch drinks. Their service was exceptional. We're already planning our next visit – the team loved it! Highly recommended.,1
14761,"Came here for my bday, had a late reservation and was a few minutes late, but they sat us anyway. We just had to order before 10 when the kitchen closes. We got three apps - all were amazing. Definitely try the paneer, great texture and love how the chutneys were in tubes! The bhel had lots of flavor and lotus chips. We got 2 entrees - the Butternut Squash Kofta was unique and unlike anything I've ever had before & the paneer tikka gravy was great. We had the hazelnut gelato for dessert, delicious. Will be back! Certain items may run out so come earlier or call to ask.",0
1678,"Stopped by this place for some late-night pizza and it didn't disappoint. Classic flavors, good quality—exactly what you'd want. I appreciated the even distribution of toppings, which can make or break a pie. Definitely looking forward to my next visit when I'm back in the area.",1
1936,"Title: MAMO's Triumphant Return!

After a prolonged closure due to a fire in 2018, MAMO has made a stunning comeback. The culinary delight that this spot was known for remains untarnished, while the service has undergone a remarkable transformation – gone are the days of any perceived attitude, and in its place is warm, attentive hospitality.

During Negroni Week, it would be almost criminal not to indulge in their house special, the MAMO Negroni. The substitution of Aperol for the traditional Campari lends an intriguing twist, elevating this classic cocktail. The food, a harmonious blend of tradition and freshness, continues to impress. Their pizzas and pasta dishes burst with authentic flavor, clearly made from the freshest of ingredients.

Do not miss out on the fried artichokes – they're nothing short of spectacular, and the eggplant appetizer is a dish that truly feeds the soul. To finish, the meringue vanilla cream cake strikes a perfect balance between airy lightness and sinful decadence. MAMO is undeniably back in full force and remains a must-visit for anyone craving top-notch Italian cuisine paired with perfected cocktails.",1
19224,"We came here on a Saturday around lunch time, I was really hoping to try to omakase but was told that they only serve that during dinner service. (They should put that on the website!)The lunch menu is relatively small. There is no hand rolls/ sushi rolls....I tried the Wokuni Don which was delicious ! Great variety of fresh sashimi over rice, there are also some shrimp tempura in the bowl but the tempura batter is not great. So i wouldnt recommend ordering any of their tempura.Overall it was a great meal. Service was good and food was decent, but not memorable....",0

13112,"Unpopular opinion here but I wasn't as impressed as everyone else. I would give it 3.5 stars at most but that's about it. I had the prix fixe menu of 6 courses with my friend and we dropped $76 each after with tip and tax. Here's a quick breakdown. Chicken wings were delicious. It was fried very well- crispy, not too oily, and the meat was tender. Paired well with the sauce they gave. Toro Ssam Bap was also very good. Well seasoned- all the ingredients went well together and it was tasteful. Roasted mushrooms were good, but not amazing. They were just mushrooms. There wasn't anything special about it and the addition of truffles wasn't necessary because they didn't add much to the dish. I didn't need the ribeye. It was cooked to medium rare and was with seasoned with salt. This was also good but again not outstanding and granted for about $30-40 it was a really small portion and you're better off going to an actual steakhouse if you want steak. The ramyun was rather disappointing. The noodles were great ramen noodles but the broth was lacking depth and flavor.  And for the dessert, you can't mess up sorbet or ice cream. If you did you shouldn't be considered a high end restaurant with this type of prix fixe menu. As my friend put it, it started out good and got progressively meh. I'm glad I tried it (not necessarily the whole prix fixe menu for that steep of a cost- you can do without half the stuff on it like the steak, mushrooms, and dessert and save yourself $20-30) but I wouldn't come back again.",0
12397,"Heading over to Wafels and Dinges near Bryant Park is a delightful indulgence, albeit a tad pricey. The waffles, served with an ample selection of toppings, justify the expense with their exquisite balance of crispy exteriors and fluffy interiors. The stand's prime location allows for a scenic snack, as you can easily take your treat to enjoy amidst the verdant surroundings of the park. With a plethora of topping options, the crowd-pleaser seems to be the heavenly combo of Nutella and fruit. Be warned, it can get messy, but the thoughtful provision of utensils and napkins helps keep things under control. If you're in the vicinity, it's certainly worth a visit for a perfectly crafted waffle.",1
2781,"At the tempting price of $15.50, I indulged in an oxtail meal that came with a generous helping of 5-6 succulent pieces. The meat was so tender it practically fell off the bone, a testament to its expert preparation. Although satisfying, the sauce's sweetness was unexpectedly pronounced, which caught me off guard.

My chosen sides were cabbage and mac and cheese. The cabbage was the star among the sides, so much so that I regretted not doubling down on it. The mac and cheese, however, was a bit lackluster – serviceable but unremarkable. For locals looking for convenience, the restaurant offers delivery for a nominal fee plus tip – a nice touch for those in the vicinity.",1
18742,"Title: A Delightful Dinner at Blossom with a Touch of Elegance

Review:

Having been a regular at the more casual Blossom Du Jour, my expectations for Blossom were high and they did not disappoint. My dining experience began on a high note with the fried artichokes—each bite was a perfect blend of crispy goodness. While the sea scallops mushrooms were aesthetically pleasing, I found the seasoning a bit off-putting and would likely pass on them in the future.

My main course, the seitan piccata, was a revelation. The dish, reminiscent of a classic chicken marsala, was indulgent with its rich truffle oil and caper sauce, making the seitan delightfully tender and bursting with flavor. Despite eyeing the pasta offerings, I have no regrets about my choice and it’s definitely a dish I would recommend.

The rest of the menu beckons and I am eager to return to Blossom to savor more of their culinary creations. A place where plant-based cuisine is elevated to fine dining, Blossom has cemented its place in my roster of favorites.",1
2370,"Title: Mixed Feelings About Our Breakfast Experience

We visited the restaurant for breakfast, drawn by its spacious interior and comfortable seating. Unfortunately, the food didn't quite hit the mark. My choice, the chicken sausage biscuit, was disappointingly dry. While the pancakes might be a future option, I'm hesitant to return after our latest encounter.

The deciding factor in our experience was the uninvited guest - a huge cockroach that took an unsavory stroll across our bench seat. The sight was enough to leave my companion visibly shaken. Despite the staff's quick response and a modest discount on our nearly $80 bill, the incident marred our meal.

Overall, I'd rate our experience at 2 stars. The ambiance and polite service partly redeemed the visit, but it's hard to overlook the lackluster food and a disturbing display of unsanitary conditions.",1
18492,"Title: A Refreshing Lunch Spot with Potential for More

I recently ventured into this local eatery, lured by the promise of healthy lunch options and came away with mixed feelings. Straying from my usual salad routine, I tried the turkey burger pizza style. Pleasantly surprised by its generous size and the juiciness of the turkey, it was a welcome change. However, the marinara sauce lacked the punch I was hoping for, and while there was an abundance of cheese, flavor depth was missing. 

The unconventional choice of pita bread over a typical bun did add a healthier twist that I appreciated. Service was noteworthy, with staff proving both friendly and efficient. Although my main course didn't entirely hit the mark, the popularity of juices and smoothies among other patrons caught my eye. I'm intrigued enough to plan a return visit, aiming to explore their range of smoothies. 

A solid choice for anyone in the area seeking a quick, health-conscious bite, this spot is worth a try, especially for liquid refreshment enthusiasts.",1
19090,"PURCHASED: Saag Paneer ($7.99) and Meat Samosa ($2) TOTAL: $10-ish PROS:+ cheapest: One of the cheapest spots around. + upstairs dining: There's upstairs dining with a view that you can look out onto the two cross streets. CONS:- overpriced: Tiny portion for $8 (please see photo) - restroom: It was sub-par. I can't believe I am giving it a 4-star. The food was good though. I am sorry to place those two sentences next to each other. IMPRESSION:Overall, this spot is cool. I have been here 3 times. It can be a bit grungy. But, this is definitely something you can only experience in New York. I would even classify it as a New-York experience. (Although the price for this was a total of $8, I used an app that significantly decreases this price. Please see photo for my referral link; that will give you $10 for free to start with also and gives me 1,000 pts.).",0
12183,"During my visit to Pastis, the experience was satisfying but not extraordinary. The evening started strong with the vole au vent cocktail, which was a delightful beginning. The cheese selection impressed with its amazing variety and taste, complementing the excellent classic onion soup. Though the Chèvre and fig salad was competently prepared, it lacked a certain je ne sais quoi to elevate it beyond the ordinary.

The main courses offered a mixed bag. The Filet mignon served with steak frites was a tale of two textures: while the steak itself was cooked to tender perfection, the accompanying fries unfortunately missed the mark with an over-seasoned and dry presentation. Conversely, the Trout amandine was the standout dish of the night – flawlessly executed and highly recommended.

For dessert, the apple tarte tatin was fine, though it failed to dazzle. It was also notable that service pacing seemed off; delays in waiter attention were a bit of a dampener, despite the commendable efforts of the runners and other staff members. All things considered, Pastis provided a decent dining experience that, with a few tweaks, could rise to the next level.",1
14201,"Title: A Tale of Two Experiences - Divine Dining Marred by Service Snafus

My visit to this establishment was a study in contrasts, offering a dichotomous dining experience that leaves me grappling with how to properly convey my thoughts in a star rating. The ambiance and culinary offerings here merit a resounding 5-star praise. From the moment I stepped into the restaurant, I was enveloped in an atmosphere conducive to a leisurely Sunday brunch, complemented by an exquisite prix fixe menu paired with the promise of bottomless mimosas.

The cuisine was impeccable. I started with the tuna tostada, which struck a perfect balance between crunchiness and freshness — a delightful beginning! For the main course, the poached egg with salmon was a culinary triumph. The egg was poached to perfection, gently nestled atop a succulent piece of salmon, making for a savory delight.

However, the brilliance of the food was starkly overshadowed by the dismal service. Our orders, much anticipated by our hungry party of ten, arrived agonizingly late. The absence of bread or a similar stopgap only added to our collective frustration. Securing the attention of our waiter was akin to an exercise in futility, and I observed with bewilderment that the service team was thinly stretched, with just one waiter responsible for our room of five bustling tables.

My quest for the promised bottomless mimosas was equally Sisyphean. After much effort, I could only claim three glasses - a far cry from the 'bottomless' experience advertised.

Adding insult to injury, the decision to preemptively include an 18% gratuity was particularly galling considering the evident service deficiencies. Opting for the workaround of self-service did little to temper my irritation with this policy.

In conclusion, the restaurant excels on the culinary front, with a menu that is sure to tantalize your taste buds. If you decide to visit, my advice would be to seek reprieve at the bar, where service may prove more attentive. Despite its service shortcomings, the food alone makes it a place worth trying — with fingers crossed for an all-around improved experience.",1
19555,"Title: A Bucket List Experience at a Gem of a Restaurant

I finally ticked off a dining experience from my bucket list when I celebrated New Year's Eve at this fabulous restaurant. The stars aligned as I walked in without a reservation and was immediately seated despite the bustling atmosphere. The restaurant was a hive of activity with a palpable sense of joy from a well-heeled crowd, and yet, the service remained attentive and prompt.

Kicking things off, the complimentary bread with butter was a simple, delectable opener. For my entrée, I chose the Poisson Braise A Le Guet Ndar—picture a perfectly grilled whole branzino with a refreshing julienne salad and sweet plantains on the side, a dish that melded flavors beautifully.

My friend's Kabash Lamb Shank, paired with Merguez and coconut rice substituting the usual couscous, was a hit; the lamb sausage and veggies were seasoned to perfection. Every dish was a testament to the skilled kitchen's ability to produce flavorful, well-executed plates.

The ambiance added to the dining experience, with the inviting bar at the entrance and a diverse menu that promised future culinary adventures. This spot has earned its place on my list of go-to restaurants, making me eager for my next visit.",1
3622,"Title: An Evening of Culinary Delights Worth the Wait

Last Saturday night, my group of four embarked on a gastronomic journey at a local favorite renowned for its remarkable dishes. Despite utilizing the Yelp Waitlist, we encountered a two-hour wait, a minor setback due to the inaccuracy of the system not accounting for walk-ins.

Our anticipation only heightened our hunger, so we plunged into an assortment of five appetizers, with the showstopper being the Atsugirl Bacon—tender, thick-cut slices adorned with onions that melted in the mouth. The Chicken Tatsua-Age followed closely, with its perfectly fried, succulent chunks paired with a zesty lemon and spicy mayo dip. The Sabazushi, a trio of pressed mackerel sushi, earned its mark as a table favorite with its unique presentation and flavor.

The Agedashi Tofu, while enjoyable, didn't reach the heights of the others, but was a decent vegetarian option. On a lesser note, the Pork Gyoza fell short of expectations, reminiscent of something you’d find in a supermarket freezer.

The main course, Niku Udon with its slow-cooked beef short ribs and honeycomb tripe, was nothing short of spectacular. The generously sized bowl delivered on flavor and comfort, with a broth that rivaled even the finest dim sum offerings.

In summary, this could very well be the top spot for Udon aficionados. Just be sure to come prepared for a wait and remember it's a cash-only establishment. The experience and flavors are well worth the effort, and I wholeheartedly recommend a visit for a genuinely satisfying meal.",1
11654,"My dining experience at this restaurant offered an interesting take on South Indian cuisine that truly impressed us. Each dish we ordered was delightfully tasty, complemented by enjoyable drinks. Although the prices seemed a bit steep, the overall quality of the food justified the cost.

I would certainly recommend this eatery to those looking for a fresh twist on traditional flavors.",1
12326,"Great spot for happy hour! I'm actually sad it took me so long to visit. I loved the ambiance and the decor, the classic touches made me feel like I was back in a restaurant in Cuba. I had heard great things about the cocktails and the mojitos did not disappoint - very delicious and very well priced ($8). No complaints about the food either - we tried the shrimp empanadas which were small but very tasty, the cuban sandwich spring rolls which were really good as well, and the oxtail croquettes courtesy of the house. It's funny because I think the manager heard me and a friend talking about how we don't eat oxtail so she gave us an order of the croquettes to try - I would get them on my own next time I come around! They also have oysters for $1.50 during happy hour which is a pretty solid deal. Overall, Calle dao has awesome food, even better drinks all in a fun atmosphere. I'm def. looking forward to coming back!",0
1372,"Came in for the lunch special. It is for a plain cheesesteak only. The cheesesteak itself isn't bad, and may be a step above most due to the bread. Upgraded my fries to Italian fries. They're pretty decent. Beer selection here is average, but it's basically a philly themed sports bar with lots of TVs. The waitress was attentive and friendly enough. I don't like to drop $17 on lunch regularly so it may be awhile before I'm back.",0
15922,"Title: A Disappointing Experience at a Deceptive Establishment

I regrettably must advise diners to steer clear of this restaurant. Be forewarned: a sneaky 15% gratuity is added to every bill, a detail not disclosed on their menus. This lack of transparency is a disservice to patrons, especially non-English readers who might unknowingly double-tip.

The service was shockingly lackluster. It seems the guaranteed gratuity has sapped the waitstaff of any motivation to provide quality service, a suspicion supported by their indifference and failure to even refill our tea.

Seating arrangements were puzzling and uncomfortable, cramming diners in close quarters despite ample space. The food, from the overpriced and unimpressive dim sum to the bland and small-portioned chicken pan fried noodles, failed to delight or justify the cost.

I observed an elderly couple unwittingly leave additional money for a tip, not realizing they'd been automatically charged, which casts further doubt on the restaurant's practices. Upon further research, I found that this gratuitous gratuity policy has been an issue since at least 2013.

In sum, this experience was a total letdown, highlighted by poor service, substandard food, and unethical billing practices. My advice is to avoid this establishment entirely.",1
2265,"I was craving Mexican food, and came across Carlos & Gabby's on my UberEats app. After checking out their menu, I decided to get a grilled beef burrito.The wait time was comparable to other restaurants in the area, and the wait was worth it.

The burrito was freshly made, and of high quality.The larger than expected portions left me comatose, which was ok as it was later in the day anyway. This place left a good impression, and I will most definitely consider them the next time that I'm in the mood for good Mexican food.",0
12659,"During a recent visit to the area, I stumbled upon this restaurant via Yelp and decided to give it a shot. Unfortunately, the experience was underwhelming.

Considering the plethora of superior Thai dining options available in the city, I do not plan on returning to this establishment.",1
16430,"Update:  went there for lunch again today.  Had the summer rolls instead of the air fried rolls.  Still good, but I prefer the air fried rolls.  Maybe I should have chosen the peanut sauce instead of the fish sauce for the summer rolls.  I also like the nice biodegradable paper containers.  No more styrofoam!  Yay.Summer rolls: peanut sauceFried rolls: fish sauceI ordered online, less hassle.  They should add a Ritual ordering option.Best pho ever!  They separate the noodles from the soup and give you a choice of ramen or rice noodles, plus choice of shrimp or other proteins.  I love the air fried rolls-- almost guilt free crispy rolls of deliciousness with pickled carrots, daikon, cilantro, lettuce and fish sauce for dipping.  The combo with a pho and side and water is around $19 but you get a lot of food.",0
14150,"Title: A Pleasant Surprise at the New Falafel Spot

I recently visited a new falafel joint in an area with plenty of competition like Naya and Roti, yet, to my delight, there were no lines to contend with here. Upon entering, I was greeted by the serene atmosphere and a spotless interior, both indicative of its novelty.

Opting for the falafel, I was met with a server whose friendliness and clear explanation of the diverse options enhanced the experience. A highlight is the unlimited toppings, allowing for a personalized feast. The falafels themselves were flavorful and well-balanced with grains and veggies—a testament to their clean taste.

At $9 for a satisfying meal, the value is undeniable. While I'm not ready to crown it the best, it's certainly a contender that warrants a return visit.",1

After an unexpectedly lengthy wait for brunch at Restoration Hardware's popular eatery, we pivoted to dinner plans and weren't disappointed. Tip for brunch enthusiasts: arrive at opening time to avoid the non-reservable rush. The venue offers a visually stunning setting, perfect for photography buffs, potentially doubling as a chic wedding backdrop. With an inviting outdoor terrace and bar, the wait can turn into a relaxed interlude. Service shifted to high gear once seated, impressively quick and attentive. The truffle pasta was a culinary highlight, both aesthetically pleasing and utterly delicious. In summary, if you find yourself nearby with time to spare, this place is a must-visit, just plan around peak times.",1
15811,"I recently had the pleasure of dining at this Korean restaurant and was thoroughly impressed with the quality of their cuisine. Unlike neighboring establishments that often resort to a simplistic chili powder and water mix, this restaurant's dishes were well-seasoned, flavorful, and not over-salted, indicating a clear dedication to using superior ingredients.

The banchan, or side dishes, were no exception to this high standard; each was crafted with care and stood out for its uniqueness and quality, elevating the overall dining experience.

Moreover, the restaurant's ambiance added to the enjoyment, with a sophisticated setting and impressive sound system, reminiscent of the fancy speakers I'd seen at a French airport.

I'm already looking forward to my next visit and would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone in search of an exceptional Korean meal.",1

If you're a local in the area - I envy you.I struggle to find great Chinese restaurants outside of Brooklyn, Queens, Chinatown, etc. While working down in the Hudson Square area, a couple of friends mentioned China Blue to me. I took a walk over for lunch the first time by myself to try it out. I am so glad I did.When you first walk in, you feel as if you're transported to another time period.

16141,"Title: Hidden Gem Near Times Square - Dutch Freds

Review:

On a recent trip to NYC, we stumbled upon a wonderful bar just a short walk from Times Square, called Dutch Freds. Labeling it a hidden gem doesn't quite do it justice – it's a must-visit spot. From the moment we entered, the hostess greeted us with a warm smile, setting the tone for a fantastic evening.

Our bartender, Matthew, was a highlight of our experience. He was not only engaging and attentive but also mixed some of the best drinks we've had – strong, yet remarkably refreshing. It's clear that Dutch Freds takes their craft seriously.

We're already planning our next visit and will certainly recommend Dutch Freds to anyone looking for an exceptional bar experience in the heart of NYC.",1
2621,"Title: A Creamy Twist on the NYC Pizza Scene

If you're ever in NYC with a hankering for something heartily unique, Artichoke pizza should be on your radar. Don't let the name fool you; even non-artichoke fans will revel in their decadently creamy, dense sauce that barely hints at the vegetable it's named after. Artichoke's pizzas defy New York traditions with their thick, substantial slices, offering a satisfying indulgence that's particularly enjoyable as a late-night ""drunchie."" At $5 a slice, you might balk at the price, but these colossal, hefty portions are well worth it. In fact, they're so filling that I often savor half now and save the rest for later. In a city that swears by the thin-crust of Joe's, Artichoke stands out as a delectably guilty pleasure that's earned its spot at the top of my pizza list.",1

1131,"Happy hour is until 7 but it's at the bar only. You can get cocktails for $8 and hot/cold sake or beer for $5. They also have some food specials: certain apps/basic rolls ranging from $5 to $10. It's a pretty solid happy hour menu considering the location by Rockefeller Center. BF and I came on the Friday night before Christmas week at around 6. The restaurant was pretty packed but luckily the bar was not.Cocktails are surprisingly pretty good. Usually at these types of places, they make it too fruity but not at Hama. I really appreciated that. We had a lychee-tini and a sake-tini, and some other blueberry-esque drink with shochu in it, which was also not bad. The rolls we had were pretty standard - crunchy spicy salmon, yellowtail scallion, spicy albacore and big eye tuna roll. It's like takeout sushi but will do the trick if you are craving sushi. The tatsuta age (fried chicken) was suprisingly good - nice and peppery, and perfectly fried.I had actually been wanting to check this place out when I used to work in the area a few years ago, and I'm glad I finally did.

11598,"Title: A Quick Bite in a Lovely Setting at Noodle Haven

Upon entering Noodle Haven, I was immediately greeted by the tantalizing aroma of noodles—a promising start. The minimalist and clean design of the restaurant creates a welcoming atmosphere, perfect for a casual dining experience.

This spot touts a vegan and gluten-free menu, yet they accommodate meat lovers by offering meat as an added extra—for a fee. Service is impressively fast, with our dishes arriving within 10 minutes of ordering.

The self-serve station is a nice touch, featuring both sparkling and regular water alongside their house-made soy sauce and a delectable gochujang that my friend likened to ""Korean Sriracha.""

My friend and I both went for the Thai Basil Chop, priced at $10. Choosing to add ground chicken for an additional $5 brought our total to $15 each for the bowl. I found the noodles well-coated in sauce, although my friend thought it was a bit excessive.

However, the portions were a letdown. The $10 base price seemed steep for the small quantity of noodles, and the extra $5 for ground chicken was unjustifiable given the minuscule amount served. The ground chicken was barely discernible in the dish and didn't seem to enhance the flavor, so sticking with just the noodles might be the better choice.

Despite the disappointing size and meat add-on, the flavor of the noodles themselves was delightful. I left the restaurant still feeling peckish but would consider a return visit the next time I'm in Chinatown—for the noodles alone.",1
20142,"The yellow window panes framing the floor-to-ceiling bar at Valerie are absolutely arresting, and set the tone for this elegant Midtown spot. We stopped in for a nightcap on the way back to our hotel, and were delighted to find a place that's serious about drinks in the midst of the tourist troughs and mediocre hotel bars between Grand Central and Times Square. The main cocktail menu is divided between Signatures - house originals - and Classics, which are self explanatory. There also was a separate page touting their gin collection and offering gin and tonics ""your way."" I'd describe the drinks menu as just trendy enough, with a slight au courant bent toward the  bitter and herbaceous but still accessible to everyday drinkers. The spirits list is similarly well rounded and unpretentious - full of savvy midrange bottles that are meant to be ordered rather than envied and admired.I had the ""If I were a Pirate,"" which featured El Dorado 12-year rum with Novo Fogo Cachaca, Glenfiddich Fire & Cane, orange, and cardamom. Bathed in the yellow light of the bar, the drink carried a warmth and deep, citrusy sweetness that made me feel like I was curled up next to a fire on a snowy winter evening.The long bar is spacious but also contains lots of intimate nooks for conversation. Our bartender graciously chatted us up about mixology as he shepherded a relatively quiet Sunday service to a close.We'll be sure to stop by next time we head into Midtown.",0
16375,"Title: Convenient Lunch Buffet for the Busy Office Crowd

Review:

If you find yourself in the neighborhood around lunchtime, joining the flock of office workers at this Indian eatery is a smart move. Their buffet, a cornucopia of classic Indian delights such as saag paneer, chicken tikka masala, and the Indo-Chinese fusion dish gobi manchurian, caters to the time-strapped professional with an array of about 8 dishes displayed for your indulgence.

While the selection is consistent—perhaps too much so for frequent diners—the efficiency of a prepared spread is unbeatable. They do miss a beat by not labeling the dishes, but for the Indian cuisine aficionado, this might be a non-issue. Vegetarians are reasonably catered to, with around half the dishes meat-free. However, for someone like me who doesn't consume meat, the variety could feel constrained.

The complimentary naan, enhanced with salted butter, is a highlight, perfect for mopping up the flavorful sauces. The sweet kheer provides a comforting finale to the meal. As someone looking to expand their culinary experiences, I am curious to see how their a la carte dinner stacks up in comparison to the predictability of the lunch buffet. Overall, it's a decent spot for a swift and satisfying bite when your schedule is packed.",1
2713,"Title: A Modern Take on Vietnamese Classics in Chinatown

My recent foray into Chinatown's burgeoning Vietnamese cuisine scene led me to a slightly upscale establishment that, despite its price point, might just warrant repeat visits. The decor breaks from tradition with a clean, modern vibe, and the service is notably kind and attentive – a refreshing change compared to some of the more rustic dining experiences available in the area.

The menu pricing does stand out—expect to pay a bit more for their basic bowl compared to the heaping combos at neighboring spots. I tried the Saigon combo with raw beef, meatballs, and brisket. The standard broth was decent; not overly rich or salty but a touch oily and lighter on noodles than I anticipated. This approach may be perfect for those who like to indulge in appetizers without overdoing it. The meatball’s texture was peculiar, not quite hitting the familiar density, and while the brisket was ample, its tendency to crumble made for an elusive hunt in the soup.

On a second visit, I opted for the ""crazy rich"" broth version of the same combo, accompanied by spring rolls. The rolls, though on the smaller side, were impressively crispy with a satisfactory filling. The dipping sauce hinted at a secret twist I couldn't quite decode. The richer broth delivered on flavor, boasting a beefy, sweet profile while avoiding the overt fattiness of some competitors.

Is the experience worth the extra dollars? It's a tentative yes. The combination of setting, service, and quality makes a strong case. While it might not become my go-to, for those looking to explore the subtleties of Vietnamese cuisine amidst a modern backdrop, this spot is certainly worth considering.",1
13542,"I visited this restaurant for a weekday lunch and found it bustling with patrons, which created a lively atmosphere. The interior is charmingly adorned, providing a welcoming vibe, and the staff were amiable throughout our meal. Unfortunately, the food's delivery was sluggish, and the overall quality was rather average.

The artichoke spinach dip stood out with its exceedingly creamy consistency, making it a perfect appetizer for a group to indulge in, albeit it was on the heavier side. While the lobster rolls were served on deliciously soft brioche bread, the lobster itself was disappointing and failed to impress. On a positive note, the branzino was notably fresh. The chicken dish, although generally satisfactory, was slightly on the dry side. Overall, the experience was a mix of highs and lows in terms of culinary execution.",1
15111,"Title: An Uptown Gem in the Theatre District

I recently dined in the bustling heart of Manhattan's Theatre District and discovered a delightful retreat from the urban rush. Tucked away across from the iconic Phantom of the Opera theatre, the restaurant is a convenient stop for theatre-goers and city wanderers alike, easily accessible by subway.

Despite its unassuming exterior, the restaurant reveals a surprisingly luxurious interior that boasts a well-stocked bar with high-chair seating. The space is ingeniously utilized, offering a comfortable dining area that extends deep into the back and includes an upstairs level for additional seating.

Arriving on a weeknight, my friend and I were warmly greeted by the manager, Teng, who promptly seated us and introduced our server, Fu. The atmosphere was surprisingly calm, affording us a peaceful dining experience near the back of the restaurant.

The service was impeccable, with Fu attending to our needs efficiently, while another staff member, Tina, ensured our comfort throughout the evening. The menu presented a tantalizing array of choices, with a lean toward robust, spicy flavors.

We whetted our appetites with the classic Dan Dan Noodles, which offered a spicy yet enjoyable introduction to the meal. Our shared entrees included Taro Chicken, with a perfect balance of heat and flavor, and the Eastern Lion Head – succulent pork meatballs in a comforting broth.

A cooling mango pomelo sago provided a sweet conclusion to our meal, countering the earlier spice with its refreshing taste.

In summary, the restaurant delivered an excellent dining experience with attentive service from Fu and Tina, delectable dishes, and a serene ambiance amid the city's buzz. For those seeking value, do not miss their lunch specials on weekdays from 11 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. A spot well worth visiting, especially when uptown!",1
1146,"Came here on a rainy Tuesday. The restaurant is modern and had a chef making dumplings in the corner. Now the food: - Salt egg rice cake: smells great. Tasted great, but too heavy for two people. I will recommend it for sharing between more people- soup dumpling: thin skin and plenty of soup. We will try the crab variant next time",0
3146,"We thought the food was very tasty. I'm usually the one that has to add a ton of salt in order for me to taste flavors-everything was seasoned perfectly. We started with freshly made lemon drop martinis, the onion soup gratin (not sure in the spelling) which was one of the best tasting onion soups I've had, artichokes with tapenade, and we both had the mussels (pei) which had a broth of white wine and garlic. Loved it! The bread was great for dipping in the broth. We finished with the crime brûlée which was also delish. The service was very good-the music was jazz which I love. And I think this Pastis is way better than the original. The space is very beautiful and very large. And even with all this Coronavirus hysteria, come 7pm, pretty much every table was taken.",0
16380,"Just to note, the cart is plastered with the name Kwik meal, but it appears they have two carts. A lot of reviews under Kwik gourmet are for the Kwik meal cart.Easy to see why there is confusion. This is for the cart at 45 and 6. I was there around 1135 on a Friday.It was cool to read the stories plastered all over the cart while I waited about ten minutes for my food. Great story, but overall, I thought the hype wasn't worth it for the $11 chicken lamb and falafel combo. (Price is a dollar higher for credit card.)Falafel balls were extremely small, like a quarter of what you'd get at a halal cart. Maybe it was because I was first in line but the chicken and lamb were not all that great. Slightly tough. Had I not asked for it, I would have gotten no green jalapeño sauce. The sauce was not very spicy. The white tzatziki sauce was good, but not enough to make up for the medium portion, lack of flavor, and high cost. I will stick to the halal trucks I already know and rely on for street meat.",0
20181,"Title: Cozy Evening at [Restaurant Name]: A Must-Try for Catfish Lovers

I recently visited [Restaurant Name] on a bustling Sunday evening at 7pm and immediately noticed the crowd. A pro-tip for future diners: secure a reservation to avoid the wait. Despite the many guests, the atmosphere remained wonderfully conducive for conversation, with just the right tone of background buzz and dim, mood-enhancing lights complemented by charming lanterns and artistic ceiling decor.

For dinner, I veered away from the usual Thai and Vietnamese offerings and opted for the Clay Pot Catfish, which, at $18, was an absolute delight. The catfish's crispiness balanced with a delicate sweetness, paired with nutritious bok choy, was not only satisfying but also made me feel virtuous about my meal choice. Although the portion was adequate for me, those with heartier appetites might find it on the smaller side.

Overall, [Restaurant Name] provided an ideal setting for reconnecting with a friend. The catfish has left a lasting impression, beckoning me to return. On my next visit, I'm eager to explore their Michelin-recommended dishes. Highly recommend this gem for both its ambiance and its unique culinary offerings.",1
15351,"Took my husband out for dinner here and absolutely loved the vibe. Cute, dimly lit, intimate. Could just as easily see a group of friends converging for dinner as I could a couple on a romantic date. The service was wonderful - our waitress answered all of our questions, adjusted the chef's sampler platter to suit allergies, and was just so friendly and nice.I'll say that the appetizer dish was fine overall - nothing blew me out of the water. BUT the main dish -- stewed okra with lamb on it -- AMAZING. I would return just for that, seriously. So tasty, so flavorful, and the texture was perfect. Highly recommend.",0
1871,"Tang Hotpot stands out for its exceptional quality of ingredients and broth, offering a premium dining experience. While prices are on the higher end, the value is evident in every flavorful spoonful. The menu simplifies ordering with thoughtfully curated sets catering to diverse tastes and dietary needs. Additionally, the emphasis on healthier broth options reflects a commendable focus on wellness. A gratifying visit for those willing to invest in superior hotpot fare.",1
2078,"I recently had the pleasure of dining at the new restaurant tucked away on the lowest level of Nordstrom, and it was a remarkably awesome experience. Nordstrom itself is a bustling hive of activity with an overwhelming array of goods, but the culinary offerings stood out as the true highlight of my visit.

The choice of restaurant was made on a whim, influenced by the attractive decor and its convenient location. The menu was diverse and appealing. I indulged in a perfectly cooked salmon and delightfully crispy Brussel sprouts, while my husband enjoyed a savory pizza alongside spaghetti garnished with succulent shrimp.

Our dining experience was further enhanced by the attentive service provided by our waitress, Hannah. Her warmth and efficiency contributed significantly to our positive impression of the establishment.

Given the quality of food and service, this restaurant has secured its spot on my list of go-to dining spots, especially during the holiday shopping season. It's indeed a hidden gem waiting to be discovered by shoppers and foodies alike.",1
1296,"Literally a HIDDEN gem, it's in a basement off of Doyler St. in old Chinatown. We stubbled across it waiting for another restaurant that had a huge wait. I stumbled into Pulqueria after reading the menu outside and getting curious. This is some of the B E S T food, for cheap. The portions are filling, the ingredients are fresh and the drinks get the job done. They do not have many cocktails to choose from at lunch, but their dinner time menu has a ton that sound delicious. We had Gringas, Camarones, and Carne Asada tacos with esquites - paired with some amazing housemade corn chips with guacamole and a glass of a sangria and margarita. I recommend skipping the wait on the restaurants around Doyers and sneak down to this basement for some authentic Mexican eats.",0
21032,"I recently visited a quaint Japanese curry spot for a Saturday lunch with a friend at noon. The restaurant wasn't too busy at that time, allowing for us to be seated promptly, and we were greeted with friendly service.

I indulged in a mushroom curry, enhanced with added pork and cheese, which did not disappoint. The curry was thick, creamy, and generous with mushrooms, while the cheese portion was substantial. Although the prices can climb with additional toppings—an $11 base plus $6 for pork in my case—the serving size was hearty, offering enough for a leftover meal, thus justifying the cost.

A customizable spice level is a perk here, although a word of caution: even a 'medium' spice proved too hot for my low tolerance, so the spice-shy should opt for 'mild'.

Overall, I would endorse this spot for anyone with a hankering for Japanese curry. It's ideal for small groups, given the cozy size of the eatery.",1
12911,I came here this morning for breakfast and it was open as early as 5am. I am happy to see the owner was happy and lively with many loyal MSK staff patronizing this business. It was very quick and easy to order the egg cheese sausage sandwich which in just 3 minutes. The photo shows the sausage is actually a hot dog with ketchup and indeed an American cheese slice and egg it's a nice morning sandwich and fair pricing at $3.99 (or 3 for $10) very uniquely New York street cart experience.,0
3548,"Title: A Cozy Spot for Authentic Southeast Asian Comfort Food

I'd been eyeing Perfect Taste for months, drawn in by the allure of their Hainan Chicken Rice. However, during my recent visit, the craving for something warm led me to their renowned Singaporean laksa instead. On a sweltering NYC day, my boyfriend and I grabbed takeout: a chicken laksa for him, a shrimp version for me, and kaya toast to share.

The restaurant was welcoming and tranquil, and we hardly had to wait before diving into our meals. The laksa was the true highlight—especially the fragrant, coconutty curry soup that came expertly packed on the side. I'd opt for the chicken over the shrimp next time, looking for a bit more substance, but the flavors were spot-on. The thick egg noodles brought comfort, though a departure from traditional laksa noodles, they held up well.

The kaya toast lost some crunch on the journey home, but a quick toast revived its charm. At under $30, this feast was a steal. Despite the heat, it's a meal best enjoyed in cool relief, but I'm already eager to return for the chicken rice. Perfect Taste is definitely bookmark-worthy for anyone craving a taste of Singapore in NYC.",1
16444,"This likely is the best ramen in the city, even compared to Japanese ramen. Their veal broth is very rich and I didn't know what to expect from it. I love noodle soups in general, but it was definitely next level.I actually visited 2 different times, the first time I got the veal broth So-ramyun. It was unlike anything I've ever had since you rarely find veal broth anywhere. The second time I was curious about the wagyu as I was told it's like the veal from our server. The wagyu is a serious upgrade over the veal; double the meat, double the quality/broth, twice as indulgent. I can't emphasize it any further, totally worth trying if you can get a reservation!",0
1769,"Title: Same Great Taste at a New Spacious Location

Having been a regular at their old spot on 7th Avenue, I decided to visit the new location for lunch and wasn't disappointed. The move certainly hasn't affected the quality of their delicious offerings. The bigger space now accommodates more seating, making the slightly longer trek from work absolutely worth it. It's comforting to know that some things, like tasty food, never change.",1
13099,"Title: Overhyped and Underwhelming

Upon eagerly visiting the much-talked-about new spot in town, my excitement quickly dwindled. The seating situation was awkward, with tables not designed to accommodate chairs on both sides, leading to a cramped and uncomfortable dining experience.

Service was efficient but lacked warmth, as orders were taken at the counter in a brisk manner. I opted for the ribeye dinner, medium rare, which was served promptly on a sizzling cast iron pan alongside corn and onions. Regrettably, the steak fell short, being both underseasoned and overcooked, failing to live up to the anticipation.

While efficiency in service is commendable, the overall experience left much to be desired. In a city bustling with culinary excellence like NYC, this establishment doesn't quite make the cut.",1
19221,"I recently had the pleasure of dining at the new Two Hands location on Bleecker Street and my experience was nothing short of delightful. With no wait time and swift service, we were seated immediately upon our 1pm arrival on a post-Thanksgiving Sunday. The menu mirrored the offerings of their other locations, maintaining the high-quality standards I've come to expect.

We indulged in the banana bread priced at $10, which was perfectly complemented with a mascarpone spread. The Build Your Breakfast also caught our attention, a steal at $10, featuring sourdough bread and eggs to our liking, with a selection of tempting sides like the perfectly roasted sweet potatoes we chose for an extra $4-$5.

The standout dish was the Breakfast Roll for $15, accompanied by a fresh side salad. The sandwich was a harmonious blend of scrambled eggs, avocado, and a tantalizingly spicy tomato sauce. To wash it all down, we shared a flavorful Matcha latte for $5.

My return to Two Hands is not a matter of if, but when. This spot is definitely a welcome addition to Bleecker Street's culinary scene.",1
10435,"I visited a small, bustling restaurant over the weekend and had made a reservation, ensuring I was seated immediately. The service was commendable with extremely amiable waitstaff. However, the dining experience didn't quite hit the mark for me. My order included a baked pumpkin Umka puff and a steak puff, both served piping hot, but their chewy dough detracted from the enjoyment and made them difficult to eat. The flavors were decent but didn't impress. The Uzbek plov, priced at $18, disappointed with its modest size and topping of animal fat instead of meat. The lamb skewer, boasting five generous pieces, was the highlight of the meal, despite its steep price. While my previous catering experience with this establishment was outstanding, with the manager providing hot and ample quality food for my event, my dine-in experience fell short in comparison. Moving forward, I would opt for their catering service rather than dining in.",1
12518,"Title: A Test of Patience at Don Giovanni

Unfortunately, my recent visit to Don Giovanni on 10th Avenue was a lesson in patience. After a busy morning exploring Hudson Yards and the Highline, hunger led us to this establishment, lured in by their Happy Hour offer. Though I had pleasant memories of their other location, this experience fell short.

With only one visibly overwhelmed server for the dining area, service was painfully slow. We ordered pizza, warned of a 15-20 minute wait. What should have been a quick lunch morphed into an hours-long ordeal, eclipsing the 20-minute mark as people around us either left or were turned away, with information that the restaurant stopped serving pizza.

The Genovese and Californian pizzas we finally received were decent, but no culinary delight could make up for the time lost. The promise of comped drinks only partially materialized, adding to our frustration.

In the end, while the food was acceptable, the disorganization and overextended wait times severely impacted the dining experience. I can only hope this was an off day due to the Hudson Yards opening frenzy, but it has left me questioning a return visit.",1
199,"Last week my friend and I decided to dine at this gem of a restaurant, and what a delightful decision that turned out to be! The beauty of the place struck us instantly; its stunning interior and warm ambience simply took our breath away, setting the stage for an unforgettable evening.

We kicked things off with the unique bone marrow bruschetta – an absolute must-try that tantalized our taste buds. For my main, I indulged in the brown butter gnocchi, a dish so singular in its flavors that it left a lasting impression.

Dessert was the show-stopping massive cocoa cannoli, laughably listed as suitable for 2-3, yet easily enough for 4-5 people – and every bite was heaven.

In sum, our experience was extraordinary, and this restaurant has certainly earned a spot on my list of places to return to for another round of culinary excellence.",1
20905,"My friends warned me about the wait for this restaurant, so once it turned 5PM, I went on yelp and added myself on the waitlist. It was only 5:01PM, but I was 19th on the waitlist! However, I think because they just opened then, they were seating people right away because it went very quickly- I was seated right away when I got there!The restaurant itself is absolutely gorgeous. The interior design of this place is amazing, and it has such a cozy atmosphere. Now to the food- when you sit down, they give you this complimentary butternut squash and coconut milk soup concoction in a shot glass which was really delicious. I also got their thai iced tea which comes in a cute glass milk bottle. Their calamari and pad thai was absolutely amazing too. It is a really good sized portion for the price- I couldn't finish my pad thai because I was so full after the thai iced tea and calamari. However, I really loved that little butternut squash soup they gave in the beginning, so I really would love to come back sometime and try one of their curries! Great food, beautiful restaurant!",0
15710,"Happy bday to me, although three days late. A few years ago, a gf proposed to have brunch together in celebration of my bday. I was moved. It was sometime after s left when I was finding it extremely difficult to move to an ideal job due to visa and sustain our rather age-inappropriate life style. The lunch quickly turned to her new job at a consulting firm. Somewhere during the conversation, I absentmindedly asked a question - how did you know what to do as this is an entirely new field? In my heart, it's truly an innocent question, as I was so determined to sing her praise and yet lack of proper reasoning. But she was offended and enraged even that I, esp I, dared to question her capabilities. So the rest of the lunch became apologies after apologies till I picked up the check in the end.. sometimes I would wonder, what if I told her that I had a standing offer from the m firm that she couldn't get in in my 3rd year of college and that she should have practiced the case studies with me instead of our JP friend she teased constantly? Will she then see me as an equal (despite I am indeed from the other school in Cambridge) and take the question at its value? The whole friendship thingy bw girls is so shallow, fragile and flimsy.. what WT lamented repeatedly still struck me as a surprise.So now every year around my bday, I always try to find a place to spend sometime with myself. No bf non sense, no pretense, no cursing and no hiding. And, this is XYST.",0
18438,"After a sudden lobster roll craving and a Shark Tank episode, I made it to the restaurant for a 2pm lunch, pleasantly finding it quite empty. The Connecticut Lobster Roll, at about $17, was a star—with warm, buttery Maine lobster and an incredibly soft, heavenly New England-style roll. The side of coleslaw and pickle complemented it well. Unfortunately, the Lobster Tots (~$10) didn't hit the mark; the tater tots were lukewarm and lacked crispiness, and the cilantro lime sauce mismatched the dish. While Cousin's made a good impression with the lobster roll, I left not completely satiated due to its size. I'd return for the roll but give those tots a hard pass.",1
1288,"Title: A Spice Lover's Delight at Thai Villa

My dining experience at Thai Villa was marked by a bustling atmosphere and a stunning setting perfect for a romantic or professional outing. Reservations are a must, given the popularity of the place, and I can attest to the added tranquility of snagging an upstairs table.

The food, while slightly on the pricier side, delivered on flavor and portion size. My panang curry with chicken ($14 for lunch, possibly more at dinner) packed a formidable spicy punch, a welcome change from other Thai restaurants that tend to tone down the heat. The dish was hearty, but those with a milder palate might consider other options.

My friend's goong ma kham ($30) impressed with its flavor, though the sauce's saltiness was notable—something for the sodium-wary to consider. 

Service didn't disappoint, with attentive staff ensuring a smooth and enjoyable meal, complete with a unique complimentary shot of soup that left an impression.

Verdict: While Thai Villa might not be the pinnacle of Thai cuisine for some, its offerings are solid, and I'm keen on returning to sample more from their menu.",1
14149,"Title: A Catch-and-Dine Delight at the Three-Floor Japanese Seafood Experience

Review:

Stepping into this multi-level Japanese restaurant is like diving into an aquatic wonderland, where diners can catch their meal from large, species-specific fish tanks – an engaging prelude to an unforgettable dining experience. Each tank is a window into an underwater world, offering choices from salmon to trout, striped bass to flounder.

With a helpful attendant guiding the fishing and selection process, even novices will find the catch-of-the-day within reach. The kitchen adeptly transforms your fresh catch into a culinary masterpiece, with cooking options that cater to all palates – from simmering in sake to a golden tempura or a succulent grill.

Our choice of flounder, crisply tempura-fried, turned the bones into a crunchy delicacy, while the striped bass emerged from the grill wonderfully tender. Not to be overshadowed, the grilled ebi (shrimp) tantalized with its smoky perfection, and the tempura abalone was a succulent treasure, its juices sealed beneath a crispy crust.

While the unique experience and exceptional quality command a price north of $100 per person, it includes an impressive sake selection, inventive Japanese desserts, and service that's both super attentive and informative. This restaurant isn't just a meal; it's an adventure for the senses that's well worth the splash.",1
1576,"Just ate here with my husband and some friends. Place was kinda empty, but that worked out perfectly fine for us. We had soup, pan fried, and steamed dumplings. All very good. Topped it off with some chines broccoli, which was soooo good. They also have a clean restroom--which is great after a long day of walking around Chinatown.",0
3394,Sat at the bar. We got our drinks quickly. Food came out quick as well. Only reason for a 4 star was that the bartenders were taking about previous customers the night before loud enough for us to hear. They do have good happy hour specials on wings and some drafts are $5,0
14441,"From the moment we stepped into the restaurant, we were swept up in its elegant ambiance and the attentiveness of the waitstaff. The standout of our dining experience was unquestionably the Dayboat Scallops, which were seared to perfection—caramelized, yet tender—and graced with a sauce bursting with umami that lingered delightfully on the palate. 

Beginning our meal, the cauliflower artichoke dip was a harmonious introduction, pairing a creamy, flavorful dip with warm, soft pita slices. However, the Spanish Octopus a la Plancha, while promising with its tasty flavors and accompanying fingerling potatoes, fell short due to the unfortunate toughness of the larger octopus tendrils, though a smaller sample hinted at the dish's potential.

The Lamb Burger was a triumph, cooked to a true medium-rare and complemented by the creamy tzatziki and whipped feta that cut through the meat's savory depth. 

Despite the slight setback with the octopus, the experience was such that we're already eager to return, if only to relish the scallops once more.",1
13854,"Would be a 3.5 but I rounded down to price and inconsistency. Super surprised that the restaurant was so large but it gets pretty loud inside. I had high expectations for this place but the food was underwhelming. First of all, I thought it was insane that a coconut cost $8. So keep in mind that this place is a bit pricey. I tried the roti telur, beef rendang, singapore hokkien mee, and the egg yolk prawns. Roti telur is not the thin flaky roti but is similar better described as a pancake. Beef rendang was actually lukewarm and very dry. So these two dishes were quite a disappointment already. Very excited to try the egg yolk prawns - but all the flavor was on the outside on the shell of the prawns and the actual meat was dry and overcooked. The only saving grace was the hokkien mee, which was a noodle dish mixed with seafood. This was actually tasty with various types of noodles and well cooked seafood. I did think the chopstick holders were super cute. But I probably won't be back here!",0
16173,"Went last night, after dropping my daughter off for Spring semester. Always bittersweet so a nice Scotch was in order. The place was packed but we somehow scored seats at the bar. I asked the bartender to recommend an Islay scotch- wanted to try something smokier/peatier than my usual Speyside style. He let me first taste the Kilchoman Machir Bay- which I ordered and sipped over the course of an hour. They have a very informative Scotch book to guide you, if needed. They also offer flights. I'll go back next time I'm in the city.",0
15857,"Pado is a newly opened sushi restaurant that offers omakase on their menu at a attractive price. Pado tasting: ($40) 8 piece chef choice nigiri sushi and a handrollBada tasting: ($50) 1 appetizer, 7 piece sashimi and 5 piece nigiri I brought my mom here to celebrate her birthday. I ordered the Pado tasting and my mom had the Bada tasting. The sushi pieces were pretty much the same except that her set came with sweet shrimp. The waitresses were very accommodating and sweet. I also think my mom was given extra pieces in her Bada tasting because it was her birthday.Overall, the fish was fresh and the price can not be beat for omakase. The only thing to keep in mind is that the pieces were very simple and plain as expected with the price. We didn't get any uni, caviar, truffles etc on any of our sushi but at least we had toro.We were seated at a table but I would recommend requesting for the sushi bar seating. My friends who went previously sat at the bar have had great experiences and seem to have gotten better pieces than I did. However, there are limited bar seating, since they only have about 4 seats in the back of the restaurant.",0
17415,"Beautiful interior. Sit down in the front, takeout in the back. Tiny tacos filled with tons of meat and flavor. $4/Al pastor, $6/Baja fish, $4 esquites. Al pastor packed tons of flavor and loved the pineapple, onion and cilantro on top. The Baja crispy fish was perfectly fried, the veggies on top not too pickled and absolutely perfect. The corn esquites backed a beautiful lime wedge on top. The sacrifice of size for quality is well worth it. Grab an Aqua fresca to cut the salt and spice in your mouth. Tacombi is an embodiment of Mexican cantinas and remembrance of a fruit market. If you have the extra dollar to splurge on these tiny tacos, you won't regret it.",0
17542,"My friend and I had a delightful dining experience at this quaint Filipino restaurant nestled in the heart of New York City. We initially aimed for their famous main entrees but arrived during the tail end of breakfast. Undeterred, we returned for dinner and were treated to a tranquil outdoor seating on a porch that exuded the coziness of a backyard at home, complete with a charming wooden fort and verdant plants.

Inside, the walls were adorned with art that transported us to the Philippines, evoking a comforting sense of nostalgia. Despite the restaurant's compact size—a typical New York City trait—the staff was incredibly hospitable, guiding us through the menu with cheerful expertise.

Our appetizers were a culinary adventure. The sisig tacos, an eclectic mix of pork parts, were a bold blend of flavors, enhanced by a zesty sauce and fresh tortillas. Even more memorable was the chicharron bulaklak—sinfully delicious deep-fried pork fat that had us momentarily disregard our health concerns for a taste of indulgence.

For our main course, the pork bicol express did not disappoint. Served in a traditional clay pot, the slow-roasted pork bathed in coconut milk and shrimp paste was aromatic and sumptuous, perfectly paired with garlic rice. While the price point was on the higher side, the quality and authenticity of the food justified the expense. Jeepney offers a true taste of Filipino cuisine that's excellent for both intimate dinners and larger gatherings, with birthday packages that even include a whole roasted pig for special occasions. A must-visit for anyone looking to savor Filipino flavors in the city.",1
17729,"Title: A Flavorful Feast Worth Recommending

My recent visit to the local Italian gem proved to be a delightful culinary experience, shared with friends and full of flavorful discoveries. The ricotta bruschetta greeted us with its amazing taste, setting the tone for the meal, while the beet salad was a table favorite with its balance of earthy and sweet notes.

The meatballs, though good, failed to leave a lasting impression and might be a pass next time. The Caesar salad's anchovy-heavy dressing might not please everyone, but the caprese was a hit with its creamy burrata and vibrant, fresh tomatoes.

A standout was the carbonara pasta, cooked to perfection and a definite must-try. Similarly, the Fusilli e Manzo with its fresh pasta and tender braised beef quickly became one of my top picks. Equally impressive was the mushroom ravioli, encapsulating perfection in each bite.

The Capricciosa pizza had a great crust, however, a soggy center detracted from the experience, causing the well-intentioned toppings to slide off. Despite this minor setback, the overall quality of the food makes this restaurant one I would happily recommend.",1
1380,"Cheap and good food. Platters are $5 and sandwiches are $4. It's a good place to get a bite to eat before a show at Lincoln Center.

11769,"Title: A Cozy Evening at Boqueria's Bar and Lounge

I recently visited Boqueria's newest location for a casual Sunday night drink, and while I didn't dine in this time, I feel compelled to share my impressions of the décor and bar ambiance. Stepping into a space that's distinctly airier than its siblings, the restaurant welcomes patrons with lofty ceilings, particularly by the entrance, adding to a sense of openness.

The interior is warmly clad in wooden panels that exude a rustic charm I found particularly appealing. As the heart of the social scene, the full U-shaped bar is smartly positioned as the focal point, flanked by high booth tables that usher you towards the main dining area, subtly blurring the lines between a casual drink and a full meal.

Despite its bustling nature, the restaurant didn't feel overcrowded, maintaining a balanced atmosphere that's lively yet comfortable. Although my visit was limited to the bar area, the inviting ambiance has piqued my curiosity about their culinary offerings. Based on my experiences at other Boqueria locations, I'm optimistic about what's to come. I'll certainly be returning to sample the menu and complete the experience.",1
16452,"I recently visited a quaint ""convenience store"" tucked away in an expensive mall, and it was an unexpectedly delightful dining experience. The space might be small, but it's smartly used and exudes charm.

The rice and beans dish was a standout; it packed a punch with smoky flavors and just the right amount of heat. For the price, especially considering the location, it's probably the best value you'll find in the mall.

I also tried their ""black and white"" sandwich, which was a testament to their creativity. It came with a particularly soft bread that complemented the filling nicely.

While I wouldn't suggest going out of your way to visit, if you're already in the area, it’s definitely a tasty option to consider.",1
19698,"Upon stepping into this quirky eatery, you're immediately greeted by a delightful kitschy decor that sets a lively atmosphere – certainly a highlight and a reason to visit in its own right. The availability of a seemingly endless array of sauces and condiments, including a generous jar of jalapeños on the table for personal heat customization, is a thoughtful touch that enhances the dining experience, especially for those who relish in tailoring their dish to perfection.

The complimentary pot of tea provided at seating is a warm welcome that soothes as you peruse the menu. For starters, the crispy spring rolls are a standout – living up to their name with an extra crunch that's sure to satisfy any texture enthusiast.

When it comes to the main course, the seafood pho brims with an assortment of oceanic treasures – from shrimp and fish cakes to crab and calamari – mingled with veggies like carrots, broccoli, and an unidentified but pleasant leafy green. Though it may not top the list of the best pho experiences ever, it's a solid bowl that hits the spot.

The restaurant readily accommodates larger groups with its banquet-sized tables, adding to the convivial vibe by serving bean sprouts and mint on platters for communal sharing.

Rounding out the facilities, the restrooms are plentiful – one upstairs, two downstairs – and are maintained with impressive cleanliness, ensuring a comfortable visit from start to finish.",1
1670,"Title: A Taste of Cloud-like Pita at Sunshine – A New York Gem

From the perspective of a seasoned Chicago diner, Sunshine has triumphantly captured the essence of Mediterranean cuisine that could rival the much-loved Naf Naf Grill back in the Windy City. My recent discovery in New York did not disappoint, with the ""om dish"" leaving a fabulous impression, not to mention the pita so airy it's like biting into a culinary cloud.

Adding to the charm is the amiable staff, whose fluent Hebrew chatters contribute to an authentic and delightful atmosphere. The kindness didn't stop at mere hospitality; upon requesting my leftovers to be packed, I was pleasantly surprised with an extra piece of their heavenly pita for the road.

For anyone craving that fluffy pita embrace, Sunshine isn't just an equivalent to my old Chicago haunt – it might just surpass it.",1
1655,"Lively and trendy evening spot!I've come here for dinner once and for Happy Hour more recently. The food is always delicious. Great happy hour and bar scene. The service is attentive, friendly and professional.  I love their BBQ ribs (which are also on their HH menu), chicken dumplings and their cocktail offerings. The ribs are tangy, cooked perfectly and are full of flavor. The dumplings are juicy and with a good amount of filling. I'm sure I'll be back soon!",0
18403,"Title: A Mixed Bag of Hits and Misses at Vibrant Local Eatery

Last Friday night, our party of seven adults and an infant found ourselves searching for a last-minute dining option when original plans fell through. This local spot was not only able to squeeze us in at 5:30 PM but also graciously agreed to push our reservation to 6 PM upon our request, reminding us of a strict seating policy and a 5-minute grace period.

The ambiance, however, wasn't particularly accommodating for our youngest diner; the bustling noise level coupled with seating at a high table mismatched with a standard high chair made it less than ideal for babies.

Culinary speaking, we kicked off with the customizable appetizer platter - a highlight being the chicken spring rolls and a delightful spicy cilantro mayo dipping sauce that I couldn't resist pairing with other dishes. The calamari was satisfying, yet the shrimp dumplings were forgettable.

The main course offerings, with their standardized pricing based on protein choice, presented a streamlined approach to ordering. My pad see ew with chicken was commendable, though it didn’t top my list of favorites. Intriguing items like Khao Soi and spicy lemongrass fried rice peppered the menu, promising both traditional and adventurous tastes.

A final pro tip for fellow diners: don't overlook the hot sauce trio, a fiery complement to any dish.

In summary, while the restaurant may not be suitable for families with small children due to the space and noise, it's a solid choice for small groups poised to enjoy a range of Thai flavors with a side of zest.",1
3039,"So good! Loved everything we had. Eel tacos, steak, kimchi paella, soft shell crab, truffle Mac and cheese, pop corn ice cream, and popcorn chicken. Would definitely come back. My friends and I waited on line about 20 minutes before opening on a Friday evening and  got seated once the restaurant opened. I don't believe they take reservations. The staff is friendly and explained all of the items to us as they brought it to the table. Bernard was our server and he was awesome :) thanks for everything!! See you guys again soon.",0
15742,"This is a really cool place for drinks! I came here after dinner at Gitano Jungle Room. There was a line to get in, but since we were just drinking and there were only two of us, we got in right away.Once you walk in, you really feel like you are in Mexico. There are tons of different sections and the beach feel throughout is refreshing and different for a New York bar/restaurant! It was pretty crowded when we go there around 9:30, but it thinned out as the night went on. It's definitely a place to start at and then go somewhere after later on.I had the rose sangria and it was awesome! I loved the strawberry flavor in it. Even though it was $19, I would get it again. At a place like this, I would expect to pay that for a cocktail. I would definitely come back here, just for the atmosphere. Next time, I'd love to try their food!",0
12374,"I think it's safe to say ROKC is my favorite ramen experience. I say experience because not only is the food great, the bartenders also really know what they're doing. They have an expansive menu of well put together cocktails. The way they serve them to you is also pretty unique. One drink is served out of a light bulb! The edamame is served with yuzu salt and I didn't know I was missing this all of my life. Sooo good! The shrimp buns are out of this world. My God! Wow. They have seasonal menus but I believe the apps stay the same, some of the ramen filters in and out. I tried the Sapporo, so flavorful. I never finish a whole bowl of ramen, but this one didn't stand a chance. It's tucked away in a small space in Harlem, it almost has a speakeasy vibe. You have to walk down a few steps to get to it. They don't take reservations and probably not good for big parties. Sit at the bar If you can so you can watch the mixologist work at their craft.",0
12267,"Title: High Hopes, But Let Down by the Main Course

After eagerly awaiting my visit to what seemed like a promising restaurant, I was met with a mixed bag of an experience. The starters, namely the toro ssam bap and cucumber kimchi, were the highlights of the meal, offering a delightful combination of refreshing and beautifully seasoned bites. However, the main dish, the gochu ramen, failed to live up to expectations. The pork belly suffered from overcooking, resulting in an unpleasantly tough texture, while the soup base was excessively salty and overwhelmingly heavy, to the extent that I left it unfinished—a rare occurrence for me.

Considering the establishment boasts a Michelin star, I was taken aback by the disappointing quality of what should have been the star of the show. With so many superior ramen offerings elsewhere, I regret to say that I won't be returning.",1
3124,"Stopped by for lunch and was pleasantly surprised! The place was decked out with Halloween decorations and had pretty good music playing without having it on blast. This is the ultimate spot for comfort food, especially on a dreary day. I shared the Mini Shepherd's Pie with my coworkers and we all thought it was really good. The mashed potato topping really hit the spot. Their Grilled Salmon was also very nicely done. They put it on top of spinach, which ended up being a bit sautéed from the oil. The onions also gave it a nice crunch as well!",0
21035,"Not my cup of tea. Went in on a Saturday. The place smelled very good. However, even upon seeing my food, I was disappointed. The presentation of the yakisoba was underwhelming. I got the sweet beef yakisoba and chicken Takoyaki and both fell flat for me. I didn't finish either. The over cooked, mushy texture tasted very cheap to me. Won't be coming back. The ratings were so high, which is what brought me in. I was very disappointed in my food. The customer service was good. But that couldn't save my experience here. Wasted about 20 bucks on the these two items.",0
20635,"So I didn't have the best experience at the location in midtown, but decided to give this location a try with a couple of friends as it was across the street from a cocktail bar. I ordered the mushroom quesadilla because the other location is known to have excellent mushrooms and flavor however this one used canned mushrooms and did not have any flavor. They did take it off the bill so I do appreciate that. My husband got the chile relenos & did not like it much. Lacked flavor and texture. Our friends got the cheese chimichanga - they were good. Smaller app portion but good enough to be full and not have to take home leftovers or waste it. For apps, we got nachos & corn which were good. Not the best Mexican food I've had, but does have a fun vibe & indoor decor as well as music & margs.",0
16034,"One of my co-workers is Jewish and religious and this place is completely kosher so we went here all the way from Hoboken NJ for a team lunch.Overall not bad but kind of pricey.Burger was good, was not particularly fan of the lamb bacon. For the price of the burgers you would think it would come with fries. Service was slow but goodAll in all if you want kosher burgers this is a good place.",0
16605,"I recently enjoyed a delightful brunch at this local spot where the avocado toast truly stood out. Priced at a reasonable $10, the dish featured thick, perfect sourdough bread topped with fresh avocado. I paired it with the Parmesan potatoes, which arrived a little crispy and wonderfully flavored with Parmesan cheese. The atmosphere complemented the meal, making for an excellent brunch experience. Highly recommended!",1
10856,"I ordered the build your own burrito for delivery tonight. I chose the more expensive option to be healthier with the ""in a bowl over lettuce"" instead of in a whole wheat tortilla wrap. I wish it didn't cost more! Tortillas are cheaper than lettuce.Anyway, I ordered it with barbacoa, mixed greens, sour cream, scallions, jalapeños, cheddar cheese and al Horno sauce (no beans for me!). It was $17.94. With tax, delivery fee, tip it would've been $24. Seamless has a $5 off your first order so thankfully it was $19. Still, pricey for Mexican food.The jalapeños were pickled. Had I known they weren't fresh, I would have chose something else.Otherwise, the cheese was melted and yummy, the barbacoa had a delicious flavor and was juicy. They gave a generous portion of it. I appreciate that. The sour cream was minimal and al Horno sauce was green and tasted okay. Like salsa verde. The mixed greens were fresh. The meat arrived hot. Delivery was early! Packed neatly.I recommend trying this place. I had a great experience ordering with them. :)",0
15892,"Title: Disappointing Visit to a Hyped Ramen Spot

I visited this ramen restaurant around Christmas with my family and came away underwhelmed. Our anticipation was built up by a 45-minute wait in the cold due to a line stretching out the door, but the experience didn't meet the expectations.

Once seated, we found the atmosphere chaotic, loud, and everyone seemed in a rush. I ordered the OG Pork Broth ramen and pork buns, which set me back $15-18 — a price point that felt steep for what was delivered. The ramen itself was a letdown; the portion size didn't justify the cost, and the broth was excessively salty. As for the pork buns, they were a mediocre affair — not freshly warm as one would hope, hinting they'd been sitting out for a bit.

Overall, it wasn't the best dining experience. I'm willing to attribute some of the shortcomings to the holiday rush and give the place another try on a less busy day, hoping for an improvement.",1
12056,"Title: Brunch Delights with a Side of Vibes at [Restaurant Name]

My friends and I chose [Restaurant Name] for a weekend brunch and were not disappointed with their family-style special. It's crucial to hash out your menu choices as a group beforehand since selections are limited to one or two of certain items – teamwork makes the dream work!

The culinary highlights included a savory mushroom pizza and an indulgent French toast, while the mezcal mimosa added a zesty kick to the meal. Service was attentive and friendly, enhancing our dining experience.

Ambiance-wise, the restaurant boasted a modern and aesthetically pleasing decor. However, it leans towards being a tourist hotspot, which might not appeal to those seeking a more unique or local experience. The clientele seemed pretty homogeneous, which detracted from the cultural vibe of the place.

Would I return? Absolutely. It's worth recommending for a laid-back yet delicious brunch. Just be prepared for a potentially predictable crowd.",1
14223,"Title: A Nostalgic Nautical Nip at the Oyster House on Pier A

After a delightful stroll through South Street Seaport, my curiosity and thirst led me to the Oyster House at Pier A, a restored harbor house with a rich nod to New York's maritime past. The venue is impressive, with its three-tiered structure offering a variety of experiences. My adventure, however, was rooted on the ground floor, where the casual ambiance of the Oyster House beckoned.

True to its self-service style, I found the arrangement straightforward: food and drink to the right, seating to the left, and the option to expand the experience outdoors. As someone who has called New York home for over three decades, I am still uncovering the city's historical layers. This visit was a glimpse into the fish market culture that once dominated Manhattan, with the Fulton market reigning supreme from the 1830s until its relocation in 2005.

The Oyster House feels like a tribute to that era, almost as if it's frozen in time, allowing patrons like myself to savor a piece of New York's foundational history. Although on this occasion I only indulged in drinks on the dock, the atmosphere alone is a compelling reason to return. For those interested in delving deeper into this fascinating period, a visit to the nearby South Street Seaport Museum comes highly recommended.

My experience at the Oyster House was a brief yet pleasant affair, one that I've shared previously and would gladly repeat. Next time, I look forward to sampling their culinary offerings, which I hope will be as evocative of the location's storied past as the surroundings themselves.",1
19193,"Title: A Disappointing Culinary Experience Amid Limited Options

In the gustatory void of our work area, my colleagues and I often find our lunch options limited to the usual fast-food chains. Seeking an alternative, we turned to a well-reviewed, delivery-only restaurant, hoping for a more gratifying midday meal.

Our order arrived timely and accurately, much to our appreciation—a rare occurrence in the world of online food orders. My choice of the day was a chicken lunch paired with a side of pecan pie.

Regrettably, the meal fell short of expectations. The chicken, accompanied by mashed potatoes and a solitary piece of broccoli, was shockingly devoid of any seasoning, lacking even the bare minimum of salt. The accompanying gravy failed to rescue the dish, reminiscent more of a flour-water paste than a flavorful addition.

This sentiment echoed among five of my colleagues who faced the same bland fare that could best be compared to uninspired diet food. The pecan pie, too small to leave an impression, had its namesake nuts relegated to the periphery with none atop the actual slice.

In all, while the delivery service deserves commendation, the meal itself was a forgettable experience. I'm compelled to award two stars for the punctual delivery but regrettably none for the meal that left us reaching for the salt shaker.",1
13617,"Title: A Taste of Cinco de Mayo Festivities at Natureworks

I recently had the chance to experience a slice of Natureworks' festive offerings during their Cinco de Mayo celebration. At first glance, it wasn't immediately apparent that the establishment known as ""cinco de Mayo"" on Grubhub was the very same place, given its discreet presence. Yet, upon arrival, I was pleasantly surprised to find Natureworks serving up a variety of Mexican delicacies – tacos, enchiladas, and quesadillas.

Taking advantage of a generous 40% off Grubhub coupon, I indulged in their special menu, which proved to be a smart move. For just $21, I received four sizable tacos and enchiladas. Each dish was flavorful and satisfying, suggesting that Natureworks does justice to the theme.

Although I've yet to explore their regular menu, if these Cinco de Mayo specials are any indication, I'm optimistic about the quality and value they likely offer on a typical day. Based on this experience, I can confidently say that a return visit to Natureworks is on the horizon to see what their standard fare has in store.",1
14925,"Reviewing for lunch on a Sunday - fantastic experience. Food, atmosphere, and staff are all on point. I'll start with the food - the Wiener Schnitzel was one of the best I've had! Meat is really tender, and the cutlet is fried to the right amount of crispiness/flavor. The sides of the lingonberries, cucumbers, and potato salad are delicious complements. I also took time to appreciate the interior decor and restaurant vibes. The walls are mostly lighter colors, which reflect the morning sunlight very well to create a bright and comfortable atmosphere. The oil paintings of Austria that line the walls also add a nice touch. There were only a few guests late Sunday morning, which was a much-needed relief and quiet from the busyness of Manhattan. Last but not least, the staff are very friendly and warm. They've taken a point to ask how every dish was and if I needed anything, and they even heated my coat so it was warm and toasty when I left.",0
10308,"You see it all over social media. The stars come here. Complex used PSP for events. So you may think it's ""overhyped"" but I'm here to tell you as a midwestern visiting the city I was extremely impressed. I got in around 11:45 on a Friday and there were a few people in line ahead of me. I knew what I wanted so as soon as it was my turn I gave my order to the nice man behind the counter. The spicy square slice of pepperoni pizza is heavenly. I ate inside - two rows of counter tops along the sides - as a few others did the same. The only oddity to me was that all the trash cans were outside. I will for sure recommend this to others who come to NY and want to try the cupped type of pepperoni.",0
20141,"**Review of the Local Lunch Spot**

I'm a regular at this nearby joint, mainly due to its proximity to my office. I find myself caught in a lunchtime dance between two menu staples: the Quinoa Taco Salad and the Kale Caesar.

The *Quinoa Taco* is flavorful but struggles with balance. The abundance of lettuce overshadows the spicy chorizo/tempeh, which is disappointingly scant. Their vinaigrette doesn't quite hit the mark for me, prompting me to reach for the chipotle aioli or tofu crema instead. Both would benefit from some tweaking – the aioli, for instance, edges on too sweet.

The *Kale Caesar* has similar balance issues; it's predominantly leafy, with sparse toppings that include overly crispy shiitake mushrooms and avocado. Thankfully, the maple croutons are a highlight. I recommend adding tempeh for some much-needed substance.

A saving grace is the availability of condiments like beet ketchup and chipotle aioli near the cashier—I'm no stranger to them given the salads' flavor deficits.

In essence, although the place offers healthy options with an inkling of exciting flavors, it's missing the mark on execution. I'm hopeful for improvements. Despite the shortcomings, its convenience secures my return.",1

Given I got there around 9:45 most of their item was sold out, but I was able to get the BPEC.Verdict: A bit small and for $4.30 it is a bit on the high end. I took 3 or 4 bites and it was gone.  Given the bacon was good,  the egg was creamy, and the potatoes was on the soft side (wise they have crisp then up a bit more) it was a descent breakfast taco. Now if they made a breakfast burrito at a price point of $5.75 (with tax), I can see myself getting that every morning.  So the question to the King: would you want a customer to come every so often or the same customer to come every morning?",0

13839,"While the BBQ is delicious, the FISH is where it's at! Although our waiter strongly recommended the ""7 ways beef platter"" for dinner, it didn't seem to make sense for 3 people. In the end, it was a good decision because we were able to try more variety at a lower price per person. I thought all the meats were good (the carpaccio being one of my favorites), but the fried catfish was really the star of the show. Even the smallest option at 2 lb is HUGE. Delicious crispy fried skin with the most tender and flaky meat. Dip a piece in one of the different complimentary sauces and enjoy!Add the Banh Hoi Platter to make rolls with the meat. The fish is definitely a larger serving size than expected, so order appropriately.

The restaurant presented a clean, modern vibe with helpful, oversized menu images adorning the walls that streamlined the ordering process. Service was swift and efficient.

I indulged in the Chinese pork burger and rice noodles, both of which were seasoned to perfection with high-quality, fresh ingredients. The braised pork in the burger stood out as exceptionally juicy and tender, a real masterpiece. The rice noodles packed a spicy punch that was a bit much for my palate, though I can see spice enthusiasts thoroughly enjoying the kick.

I celebrated my 25th birthday at 82 Stanton and couldn't have asked for a better experience. Finding a venue in December was tough, but 82 Stanton welcomed us with open arms and no minimum spend—an absolute rarity during the holiday season! After speaking with Anthony, who expertly manages events, we were set for December 7th.

The customer service was exceptional. Both Anthony and Devan, the manager at 82 Stanton, were incredibly attentive, ensuring our party of 40-50 guests was well taken care of. They even prepared a special touch of a Prosecco bottle and a personalized sign for our reserved area, which was a delightful surprise.

The greatest concern of overcrowding or friends not being able to get in was swiftly put to rest, as the night progressed smoothly without a hitch. The ability for everyone to have their own tab added to the seamlessness of the evening.

All in all, the staff at 82 Stanton ensured my birthday was a night to remember. I highly recommend 82 Stanton for any event and will certainly be endorsing them to my friends. A hearty five stars for an unforgettable experience!",1
18616,"Last week, my husband surprised me with a reservation at Rahi for Restaurant Week, where the charm of Indian fusion cuisine was on full display. The food was delightful; however, I found the brunch and lunch options for vegetarians somewhat limited, confining us to dishes like Mushrooms and Edamame Artichoke Chaat. Desiring more, I requested to order from the dinner menu—which boasted a broader vegetarian selection—but was initially denied. Fortunately, the understanding manager later accommodated my ask, letting me choose from the regular lunch offerings.

I am incredibly grateful for that because it led me to discover their Masala Omelet. It's a must-try, blending irresistible Indian spices with a generous amount of cheese for a truly exceptional taste experience that left me craving more. Along with our 2-course meal from the Restaurant Week menu, which included a complimentary amuse-bouche that was simply delightful, mango lassi, rice, and assorted naan, we left feeling utterly satisfied.

Overall, Rahi impressed with its great ambiance and stellar Indian fusion dishes. High points definitely go to that Masala Omelet, the amuse-bouche, and the Mango Lassi. While I didn’t try it myself, the Banana Leaf Chicken comes highly recommended. If you find yourself at Rahi, these dishes are not to be missed.",1

I recently visited Handsome Rice and opted for a meatless Japchae, which cost me around $8.50. The restaurant lives up to its name with a very clean interior and appealing decorations.

However, even though I had pre-ordered, my supposedly ready meal had me waiting an additional 5-6 minutes — precious time, considering my rush back to the hospital. The staff member also appeared nonchalant to my urgency while packing my order.

The Japchae itself was disappointingly oily, which detracted from the overall experience.

While Handsome Rice presents a charming facade and might have other delightful offerings, my initial visit left a lot to be desired, given the wait time and the quality of the dish.",1

2928,"Title: A Gem for Vegans and Omnivores Alike!

I recently dined at a fantastic vegan fast food spot in NYC with a friend and was blown away by the experience. Despite being a non-vegan, I found the food irresistibly delicious. The restaurant was bustling, a testament to its popularity in a city brimming with dining options.

The buffalo wings were a standout - full of flavor and perfectly seasoned. Equally impressive was the mac and cheese, creamy and comforting. The cauliflower dish didn't disappoint either, adding a delightful crunch to our meal. They offer an array of drinks to wash down the feast, which is a definite plus.

Though on the pricier side with portions that could be more generous, the quality of the food justifies the expense to some extent. Despite this, the overall experience was exceptional, and I would wholeheartedly recommend this place to anyone. It's a hit in my book, and I'm already looking forward to my next visit!",1
18977,"Once a culinary gem, this establishment has lost its luster. Renowned for its Cantonese crabs, which used to attract even the likes of Anthony Bourdain, the dish is now merely passable and no longer the showpiece it once was. The dry style crab, sautéed with pork and eggs, falls short with its overcooked consistency, charred roe and cumbersome portion sizes that challenge even the most ardent seafood enthusiasts, especially without the aid of scissors.

The accompanying dishes only add to the disappointment. The Hot and Sour soup, with its overpowering ketchup-like flavor, was unrecognizable and underwhelming. The snow peas, a simple dish even in the most amateur hands, failed to impress with nothing more than a splash of oyster sauce, making it hardly worth the order. The sea bass, though presented with a ginger sauce, was so lackluster that my husband found himself reaching for the salt shaker in a desperate search for flavor.

In the end, the unfulfilling meal drove us out in search of solace, which we found in a slice of Joe's pizza. Safe to say, this is one dining experience we'll not be eager to repeat with so many other culinary delights available in New York City.",1
20109,"Title: Craft Your Own Ramen Delight at Unique Eatery!

From the moment you're handed a clipboard brimming with delightful options, the adventure at this quirky ramen spot begins. Designing my bowl was immense fun—I opted for the standard ramen, spruced up with a generous helping of green onion, kikurage, and tender pork chashu.

But the experience didn't stop there. Guided through a curtain, I found myself in an unusual, office-like space, complete with personal ""cubicles."" There's a charm to receiving your steaming bowl through a quaint bamboo curtain, a touch that adds to the restaurant's novelty.

The ramen itself? Simply exquisite. The broth was a treasure—velvety, rich, and bursting with flavor. However, as I delved in, I couldn't shake off the sensation that it lacked a certain je ne sais quoi, possibly due to the DIY aspect of adding toppings.

Meanwhile, my wife chose a simpler combination, featuring kikurage as the star. While her bowl was more straightforward, the flavors still managed to dance delightfully on the palate.

In summary, this place is a gem for those seeking a unique ramen outing with delicious outcomes, though it could benefit from a more intuitive approach to the customization process.",1
15683,"Came here on a recommendation from coworkers. I had lunch here; dinner service might be different. Our server seemed to be in a mood and sat us with very few words and a bit of an attitude. I was kind of hoping she was the hostess and not our server, but she did come back to take our orders. When we sat down, the first thing I noticed was that the prices on the menu are all 2-3 dollars more than what I had just seen from a menu online. So, that should be updated. I had the fish and chips and my friend had the chipotle chicken sandwich. My fish and chips were very good. The batter on the fish was perfectly light and the fish was really crispy. Would I come back and pay $22 again for it though? Probably not. My friend's chicken sandwich looked really good and he enjoyed it but I also thought that was a bit pricey. Someone did stop by to check on us after our food came out but it wasn't our server. We didn't see her again until I called her over to ask for the check. Overall, pretty good but overpriced food and okay but not super attentive service.",0

Through sheer determination, I snagged a 5pm Wednesday slot, and I'd battle the odds again in a heartbeat.

The ambiance of the restaurant takes you on a time-traveling adventure, with its cozy, 10-table setting exuding warmth from the moment you step in. The service was impeccable, courtesy of the delightful Shea, who made our experience nothing short of stellar.

The cocktail offerings, a Lillet Rose Daisy and a filthy martini, set a high bar with their flawless mixology. Though our hearts were set on the elusive off-menu truffle mac and cheese, it was not to be that night. Nevertheless, the meal was a parade of showstoppers: a legendary cheeseburger topped with egg and bacon, a succulent 22 oz ribeye, perfectly creamy spinach, and a lime-infused corn that delivered a sharp twist. A courtesy slice of English cut prime rib from Shea completed the indulgence.

This feast proved too grand for two, but the culinary euphoria rendered any notion of regret obsolete. 4 Charles confirms that some legends are real – and absolutely worth the pursuit. I eagerly anticipate my next visit.",1
2784,"I had the pleasure of dining at a remarkable seafood spot in NYC known for its exceptional seafood, chowders, and oysters. The ambiance is comfortably casual, with a warmth that invites relaxation. No fuss with reservations; seating is communal and welcoming, adding to the laid-back vibe. You can also snag a spot at the bar. For those on the go, takeout is a swift and convenient option. Highly recommend for an outstanding seafood experience in the city!",1
10343,"So this is one of my favorite burger joints to go to when I'm working. I've tended to stay away bc of my diet, but decided to cheat. The meat is amazingly moist, their flavor profiles with toppings and combinations make them an amazing burger. Now I do wish it wasn't as pricey for a burger fries and a drink, but this ain't no fast food nonsense. This is a solid burger and fries to match.",0
2180,"Very good Vietnamese, and a good option for this area. First visit, my wife and I both got the deluxe pho, and we shared the papaya salad and spring rolls to start. The spring rolls were probably our favorite dish, and I regret not getting the crepe. I'd probably skip the papaya salad next time around.",0
14726,"I recently dined at Oki Poke & Ramen in NYC, and it was an experience to remember. The chic ambiance immediately set the tone for a delightful evening. The highlight of our visit was the exceptional service, especially appreciable was their flexibility in allowing us to bring our own drinks.

We started with the pork buns and calamari appetizers, which arrived promptly, served piping hot and packed with flavor. The calamari was pleasantly chewy, paired perfectly with a zesty mango sauce that delivered a surprising kick.

For the main course, the Salmon Lover Poke Bowl was fresh and satisfying, but the real standout was the Volcano Poke Bowl – a truly explosive flavor experience.

In short, Oki Poke & Ramen is a must-visit for any food lover in NYC.",1
15317,"I recently visited a charming little bar that boasted a delightful ambiance, which was only enhanced by the attractive lighting on the back wall. Luckily, I snagged a seat at the bar and decided to try the intriguingly named cocktail, ""To Die Dreaming in Kentucky,"" priced at a reasonable $15. The vanilla-infused drink veered towards sweetness, making it an excellent choice for those who prefer a delicious cocktail that doesn't overwhelm with alcohol taste. While I missed the happy hour offerings on this visit, the promise of good deals is enough to draw me back for another round in the future.",1
17314,Tight space inside and outdoor seating. Not the friendliest of staff and you feel rushed to order. Tried the chocolate croissant and it was okay. Didn't taste that fresh and airy. The cinnamon roll was alright. The ham and egg croissant was good but not $10 good.,0
2059,"Very good classic American food.Got in delivery and it came relatively quick and the food was still in great condition.Got the bacon Mac and cheese, truffle and parm fries, market veggies (chose cauliflower, broccoli, kale, and the beets with goat cheese and walnuts), and the breaded avocado tacos.The bacon Mac and cheese was really nice. Good crispy top and nice semi-liquid cheese at the bottom of the dish to dip into. The bacon was thick cut, though it would have been cut smaller and to allow more areas of the Mac cheese to have bacon.The breaded avocado taco was tasty, but the soft taco fell apart, probably due to delivery. Oh well. Highly suggest them for when corona is over. Maybe they can use crisp up the tortilla for delivery for now.The truffle Parmesan fries were amazing. Wonderful truffle flavor throughout and a nice crispy yet soft fry.The market veggies were a mixed bag. The cauliflower and the beets were good. The broccoli and the kale salad were just ok.All in all I would come back when corona is over and try some other items.",0

The soy-based ramen, whose name slips my mind, was truly delightful, brimming with robust flavors, though I would have appreciated a more generous serving of noodles.

The establishment boasts an inviting dark ambiance complemented by an old-school vibe, which enhanced the dining experience. I'm already looking forward to my next visit.",1

If you're looking for a top-tier ramen experience in the city, insert the name of the ramen spot here is your destination. Pro-tip: Take advantage of their all-day hours on weekends, and for a smooth start, target your arrival for the dinner opening at 4:45 PM. My dining companion and I breezed into our seats at 5:15 PM on a bustling Friday evening, dodging the typical long waits.

We dived into the Karaka-men—perfect for those who like a little kick without going overboard. The genius lies in the presentation; with the spice paste perched atop, diners have full control over their spice adventure. The pork buns are a revelation, boasting an irresistible combination of flavor and tenderness, while the chicken wings offer a satisfying crunch, nicely balanced with a side of refreshing, sesame-oiled cabbage.

Our feast, which included two bowls of ramen and a duo of appetizers, came in at a reasonable $55. This spot has solidified its place as one of my favorite ramen joints in the city, and it's not hard to see—or taste—why.",1
10522,"This is a cute looking cafe and dumpling place. The food was good but pretty standard. There are probably a lot of better places in the city that are more authentic.

18428,"Title: Mixed Feelings on Casual Dining Spot

Last week, I visited this restaurant with friends for a pregame and quick meal. On a sleepy Sunday afternoon, the venue was mostly empty. Opting for a light bite, I chose chicken wings, which turned out disappointingly bland despite the sweet chili sauce. The Pad Thai my companions had seemed decent but nothing spectacular.

My pineapple mojito was underwhelming, heavy on juice and light on mojito essence. One friend's ""Bend Me Over"" cocktail, by contrast, packed a punch. The spot offers affordable fare and might suffice for a no-frills drink and snack, but I wouldn't recommend it for dinner. The culinary quality didn't impress, especially with superior Thai options available elsewhere. I might consider revisiting for a lunch deal, but only if I'm nearby.",1
18850,"Build-your-own bowl spots are everywhere in this area, and now you can build your own Japanese bowl at new arrival Mazete, which specializes in mazemen (mixed noodles/broth-less ramen). As you proceed down the line, you choose your:- Base: noodles, rice, greens (or split in half)- Sauce- Protein: pork, chicken, beef, and tofu, which are currently all the same price ($10.95)- Toppings: choose up to 3. Note that wasabi guacamole is extra, but shrimp tempura is not. Garnishes of scallions and/or cheese are also included in the price.Overall, I liked what I got on my first visit (half noodles and half greens with miso bbq sauce, tsukune chicken, shrimp tempura, marinated tomatoes, mushroom salad, and scallions), with my favorite parts being the noodles and the tomatoes. Texturally, the noodles were great, which is exactly what you would hope for from a mazemen spot. Next time, I think I might try a different protein and sauce, as I thought my combination turned out a little too salty, but the flavors were good.If you dine in, you'll be rewarded with a bright, open, and well-designed space that has a good number of seats. The bathroom (code required) was clean and spacious (no changing table though despite its size), and I liked that they added an extra sink outside the bathroom (since you can't wash your hands too much these days). Prices are similar to other spots in the area, and everyone working there was really friendly.",0
18673,"If you're looking to splurge on a business dinner without a second thought on the expense, then this upscale spot in midtown might just be your gem. The service here strikes the perfect chord of attentiveness without intrusion, setting the tone for an excellent dining experience.

The Caesar salad, a seemingly mundane choice, was curiously absent from the menu but turned out to be a delightful surprise with its rich and flavorful ingredients. It's a testament to the kitchen's ability to elevate even the most basic of dishes.

The centerpiece of our meal was the whole red snapper special, priced at a steep $140. While it might induce a gulp at first glance, it justifies itself with the quality and execution – the fish was buttery, well-textured, and flawlessly cooked. Paired with two sides, including some delightful shishito peppers, the meal rounded out to be indulgently satisfying.

Although the price point is high, the portions are generous, leaving no room for dessert on this occasion. For those seeking a quality experience in midtown with cost as no barrier, this restaurant delivers a memorable indulgence.",1

Great for groups and dates Food: We did the restaurant week menu with a couple of additions for the sake of my curiosity.First addition:The creamy Burrrata with strawberry jam was VERY interesting . It was almost as if the Barada had been melted, altering its consistency to make it harder to break but easier to spread. It did come with Smokey charred focaccia bread Which was a poor decision on the Chefs part since it diluted the burrata taste . Didn't work well : pass! Second addition:I don't drink and have been having a great time exploring the mocktail cultureIn the city. Perry Street was no Gramercy Tavern in this regard but it did not disappoint with its Yuzu strawberry, Ginger lime and lychee grape options..You can also customize the sweeteness which was a nice touchFor the rest of the week pretty much stuck with the restaurant week menu but the butter steamed lobster which was not on that caught my eye and I think I will be returning for that.My favorite appetizer was the sashimi with the coconut lime sauce with hints of lemongrass and chili tapioca balls strewn like caviarThe mushroom toast was also very well done and their Bread was definitely FrenchThe entrees: Steamed sea bass with mango and squash ( which I'm generally moody about ) was a 4.5/5- Not the best Seabass I've ever had but definitely up thereParmesan crusted Amish hen chicken on a bed of corn Was basic- 4/5Desserts - molten lava cake with toasted almond gelato and blackberry sorbet with roasted plum - 3.5/ 5 - - However, I'll say I have unrealistically high expectations of French desserts as they should pack and out of worldly experience in everybite in my opinion.

13712,"After much anticipation from glowing reviews, my boyfriend and I opted for a Friday evening dinner at the local hot spot to wind down after a hectic work week. While we dodged the dinner rush and were promptly seated upon arrival, the cramped seating arrangement was less than ideal, offering hardly any personal space.

Our waitress's tardiness and curt manner when taking our orders set a disappointing tone, further dampened by her lackluster responses to our menu inquiries. The restaurant's loud ambiance was partly mitigated by its charming décor, complete with trees and twinkling lights that created a cozy, albeit noisy, dining environment.

The arrival of our dishes was swift. We started with chicken dumplings, which were unremarkable. The dough had a decent texture, but the filling was underwhelming, with an overpowering chive flavor that drowned out the chicken.

My lemongrass pork vermicelli, served lukewarm, featured an unappetizing portion of fatty, flavorless meat—far from the delightful mix of textures I had envisioned. The side of fish sauce and carrots could not redeem the dish, leaving me unable to finish my meal out of sheer disappointment.

My boyfriend's spicy pho with beef eye received praise for its broth, but the nearly raw meat was a deterrent rather than a highlight of the dish.

Regrettably, the evening was a letdown. Given the lackluster service and uninspiring food, we have no intention of returning.",1
19426,"Title: Tasty Bites with a Side of Discomfort at Chic Eatery

Recently lured by enticing Instagram posts, my friend and I decided to try out this buzzworthy spot. The evening started on a good note with a crisp white wine and a complimentary drink upon check-in.

The truffle pasta, served with a showy wheel-and-fire presentation, was a visual delight perfect for social media. Flavor-wise, it was decent with a rich, heavy sauce and aromatic shaved black truffles, but I've experienced more impressive renditions elsewhere.

The star of our meal was undoubtedly the Pesto Gnocchi with Burrata. Its lighter sauce paired harmoniously with perfectly cooked pasta, and the creamy burrata was a standout addition.

However, the service took a dip when our waiter unnecessarily highlighted the price of the truffle pasta. The presumptive comment tainted the experience, suggesting a prejudgment that was both surprising and unwelcome.

Ambiance-wise, the restaurant sports a modest decor with a cozy feel. Service overall was average, with some delays, notably when settling the bill. Be prepared for higher-than-average prices for pasta dishes, justified perhaps by the quality but certainly by the neighborhood.

My initial inclination for a 4-star rating was dampened by the service misstep, leading me to settle on 3 stars. While enjoyable, the food couldn't entirely make up for the moment of discomfort.",1
19420,"Title: Charming Ambiance Meets Tasty Fare at Local Gem

My recent weeknight dinner at this charming spot confirmed its curb appeal with an interior just as inviting. The restaurant's feminine touch, with its crisp white decor, stylish bookshelves, and large circular booths, set the scene for a clean and welcoming dining experience.

An early seating at 5:30 pm through Open Table found the eatery quiet but filling up quickly, bustling by the evening's end at 8:00 pm. The atmosphere was lively, complementing the decor in creating a pleasant vibe.

Culinarily, the menu offers above-average dishes that tantalize but may leave a food enthusiast desiring more. The shared starters—meatballs and burrata—were a hit and miss. The burrata was delightful, but the meatballs seemed a tad underdone for our taste.

The entrees were generous in portion. My Tagliatelle with Bolognese was hearty, though the addition of what seemed to be olive oil-laced ricotta rendered it slightly too salty when mixed in. My dining companion's linguine with clams was satisfactory without standing out.

The mocktail selection was a highlight with the Ginger Fizz and Almond Lemonade leaving a refreshing impression. Unfortunately, the dessert menu did not inspire us to indulge and the absence of complimentary bread was noted.

Despite some culinary hiccups, the restaurant exudes a warmth that beckons another visit, and I'm curious to explore more of their offerings in the future.",1
18217,"Title: Delightful Dim Sum Dining with Minor Hiccups

Upon entering the restaurant, I was greeted by decent decor complementing the comfortable ambiance, setting the stage for a promising dining experience. Nestled on the third floor, the serenity was perfect for a weekday escape. 

The highlight was undoubtedly the array of dim sum options. Despite the slightly slow service, likely due to the meticulous preparation of dishes, the wait was justifiable. The prices were reasonable - adding value to the overall experience.

A standout dish for me was the 蒜炒豆苗 (garlic snow pea sprouts), which came in a generous portion and were cooked to perfection. The 虾饺 (shrimp dumplings), 肠粉 (rice noodle rolls), and 糯米鸡 (sticky rice with chicken) tantalized my taste buds with their rich flavors. The 蛋挞 (egg tarts) were exceptional, boasting the ideal balance of flaky pastry and soft, sweet filling.

However, there's room for improvement with the 排骨 (spareribs) and 鸡爪 (chicken feet), which were a tad under-seasoned. Nevertheless, the 叉烧包 (BBQ pork buns) did not disappoint and maintained the quality expected from a good dim sum spot.

In summary, this restaurant delivers a solid dim sum experience with a few minor tweaks needed. I would happily return for another round of their tantalizing treats.",1
2391,"Title: A Slice of Rome in Harlem – Roland's Pizzeria

If you're wandering through Harlem craving an authentic Roman-style pizza, look no further than the newly opened Roland's on the corner of 127th and Frederick Douglass. The restaurant, born from a love that spanned boroughs for the perfect pizza, has planted its roots in the very space once occupied by Nabe, to fulfill a neighborhood need for high-quality pizza.

Roland's, named in honor of the charismatic Roland Woodland, whose passion for life and service in the Harlem community was legendary, truly embodies the essence of its namesake. His mantra, ""Live your value,"" is not only inscribed on the walls as everyday inspiration but is also a tangible part of the dining experience.

The menu is a delightful array of options, including appetizers, salads, entrées, and of course, a variety of red and white pizzas, along with calzones. Vegetarians will find plenty to savor, and anyone with gluten sensitivities can indulge in any of the 14 pizza offerings for a slight upcharge.

Do yourself a favor and try Roland's Famous Fried Pizza, a unique take where the crust is fried to perfection before baking, setting it apart from the lighter Neapolitan pizzas you might be accustomed to. Thanks to the addition of olive oil in the dough, each bite of Roman-style pizza here is deliciously dense and satisfying.

Roland's opens its doors for dinner daily at 5 pm, ready to serve up a slice of its passion for pizza to Harlem locals and visitors alike. It's more than just a meal; it's a slice of community and love, baked right into the heart of Harlem.",1
11405,"Title: Cozy Vibes with Room for Service Improvement

I visited this spot on a bustling Friday night and found a delightful haven perfect for dinner with friends. The highlight beverage, ""Oh It's Lit,"" boasted a charming presentation that instantly won us over. Although the single bartender on duty meant that our drinks trickled out slower than we'd have liked, the wait was somewhat offset by the congeniality of our waiter – a true gem who enhanced our dining experience with his friendly demeanor.

Ambiance-wise, they've nailed it with a vibrant music selection that kept the energy high. For those inclined, a jaunt downstairs reveals a lounge complete with hookah and a DJ, adding a unique twist to the scene.

As for the fare, the menu won't overwhelm you with options – think 10 appetizers and 5 mains – but it does offer a focused selection. While the food didn't knock our socks off, it was pleasingly solid; take my advice and sample the Dusse Pina Colada for a touch of tropical bliss.

In sum, while the bar service could use a boost, the fusion of atmosphere, amiable staff, and satisfactory cuisine makes for a recommendable outing.",1

Venturing into this eatery felt akin to stepping into the realm of post-grad adulthood – it’s decent, but it won't blow your mind. The pricing is reasonable, which offers some consolation. The dishes, ranging from ramen to yakitori, are satisfactory; they do the job but lack that special zing that ignites culinary passion.

In short, this spot is the embodiment of 'okay' – a safe harbor in a sea of gastronomic possibilities.",1

The gelato was flavorful and creamy, but coming to the savory foods, I'd definitely recommend trying oUt their appetizers. The baos were yum, specially when dipped in some chilli oil. The scallion pancakes were nice and crunchy, and the gyoza was good too. For the mains, the rainbow ramen is your go to if you're here for the gram, and need a good picture!

Last year, my visit to this gem in NYC left me enamored with its vibrant atmosphere, delectable cuisine, and top-tier service – a complete package complemented by an exceptional wine selection. Expectations were high as I returned this year, hoping to relive that delightful experience.

Unfortunately, this sequel fell flat. Navigating a packed venue led us to a wall-adjacent table, a small respite in a sea of tightly packed seating. The salad arrived promptly, but the request for extra dressing turned into a 10-minute waiting game, with the main course beating the dressing to the punch.

Disappointment continued with the lobster ravioli, which lacked the freshness I anticipated. The staff was accommodating, swiftly replacing it with another serving of spaghetti and meatballs, but even that couldn't rescue the evening. The flavors were forgettable; my mom's homemade sauce easily outshines what was on my plate.

The rapid service, usually a positive, this time hinted at pre-prepared dishes, which may have contributed to the lackluster taste. Cleanliness also took a hit; the less-than-spotless surroundings discouraged a restroom visit, which would have required another unwelcome weave through the cramped dining area.

I left yearning for the magic of our first visit, which unfortunately, did not make an appearance this time around.",1

I don't think we normally would have minded but we were feeling a bit peckish so we noticed the time more so than normal.

16755,"Title: A Satisfying Slurp of Authenticity at Jin Ramen

Who knew post-church cravings would lead to such a delightful discovery? Jin Ramen, upon a friend's suggestion, turned out to be not just a meal but an experience. The setting is quaint and charming, with both standard tables and a chef's bar that brings the culinary action up close—always an engaging touch.

Quickly seated, we dove into a knowledgeable waiter's suggestions and settled on chicken gyoza dumplings for starters. They were decent, nothing to write home about, but a solid beginning. The drinks, however, were a mixed bag. My white apple sake wine was lackluster, but the peach sake wine had an overly syrupy surprise that fortunately was salvaged into a pleasant spritzer with some club soda ingenuity.

Then came the star of the show: the ramen. The much-hyped Green Coconut Thai Curry lived up to its reputation, a creamy, flavorful broth that cradled the chicken thigh and veggies with care. My addition of black garlic oil was unnecessary; the dish stood strong on its own. Our table also enjoyed miso and shoyu ramen, all disappearing without a trace by meal's end, despite initial thoughts of leftovers.

A minor gripe was being nudged toward the door to accommodate a midday closing prep, but the irritation was small in the face of the satisfaction provided.

All things considered, Jin Ramen offers a delicious escape into the world of authentic ramen that's worth a visit. Harlem and the city at large may be rich with options, but Jin Ramen is a spot I'll recommend without hesitation.",1

I love that there are various different rooms. It's large and spacious with an intimidate and cozy feel. The bottomless brunch is a good deal. It took us about 20 minutes to get our drinks at the begining. I was worried that this would set the tone for the whole meal, but it didn't. I had the pearini. I was wondered if it would be too sweet, but our waiter, Alejandro, offered to bring my pear juice on the side so I could flavor it to my liking. It was perfect. The champagne glass was huge. Refills were quick. My husband got the sakejito. It was delicious. I almost got it myself, but decided to stick with my pearini. As with every place, I checked out Yelp first. The pictures of food looked good but a bit inconsistent, espcially with their poached eggs. I was worried mine would be overcooked if I ordered anything that included one. In the end I went with my gut and ordered the crab cakes. The egg was poached beautifully. It tasted great. The potatoes were seasoned and flavored just right. I had a great time. I'll have to come back and try some other things on the menu. Shout out to our waiter who was attentive, kind, and all around awesome. Thank you Alejandro. You made it a very positive experience!",0
16547,"Title: Delicious but Pricey - Skewr Review

I recently dined at Skewr and found the food to be an absolute delight. The ordering process is a tad complex for those not from New York – it involves selecting a protein (with a choice between white or dark meat for chicken), picking three sides, and adding pickles and desired condiments. Despite this, the food presented itself as fresh and downright delicious. Standouts included the string beans, the perfectly charred Brussel sprouts, and the choice of either a mixed salad or carrots. Skewr's sauces, especially the eggplant and pepper sauce, were also a culinary highlight.

Service was impressively quick, and the staff couldn't have been friendlier. However, the cost is where Skewr loses points. At nearly $14 for a meal that feels like it should be priced around $11, it's a bit steep. While the food is fantastic, the high price point is the only thing keeping Skewr from achieving a 5-star rating. For now, it sits at a solid 3 stars.",1
18042,"I recently had the good fortune to discover a hidden gem in the Upper East Side, a cozy sushi and ramen shop that offers unbeatable deals that seem almost too good to be true. It's a cash-only eatery, an aspect that likely contributes to the incredible value – though they do accept Seamless orders.

Their standout offer, 7 pieces of sushi for just $21.95, defies local competition, providing more bang for your buck compared to the measly 4 pieces you might get elsewhere at this price point. They might be modest in size, but the sushi's quality isn't compromised.

Equally impressive is their Salmon Tray, boasting 8 slices of salmon sashimi and 8 salmon nigiri rolls, priced around $20. It's a deal that's hard to pass up.

I also decided to sample their Tonkotsu Pork Ramen, a dish that holds its own against more renowned ramen establishments. For about $12, the ramen was satisfying and could easily be a meal in itself.

Walking out with a bill under $60 for such an indulgent spread is nothing short of astonishing. Considering the quality and quantity, this unassuming spot is now my top choice for a sushi fix.",1

I picked it up late so I can't comment on the crunchiness but their sweet potato wasn't up to par. It was rather dry. As for the sauce, you would think it saves the roll but it did not. The amount given was sufficient but the taste was not strong enough. As for the sushi rice, they used a good amount of rice but the flavor of the rice was identical to regular white rice.",0
312,"My recent visit to this upscale dining spot proved that while it might pinch the wallet, the culinary experience is worth the splurge. To my surprise, the kitchen dishes outshone the sushi offerings. The highlight of my meal was undoubtedly the duck tacos—an exquisite blend of flavors that I cannot recommend enough. 

Other noteworthy dishes included a succulent beef burger with robust white cheddar, the sizzling octopus that danced with taste on the palate, and the unique roasted uni that brought the sea to the table. However, I advise steering clear of the sushi rolls, which were disappointingly oversized and lacked the finesse expected from a high-end establishment. The wagyu steak, a potential masterpiece, unfortunately fell short due to being overcooked. And, the grilled carrot cake didn't quite hit the mark for me, somewhat diminishing an otherwise delectable dining experience.

In sum, this restaurant delivers some truly memorable plates—make the duck tacos a priority—but be selective to ensure each bite is as satisfying as the last.",1
13161,"Title: A Chinatown Gem for Affordable Eats

I have a special place in my heart for this unassuming spot in Chinatown, a go-to for both lunch and dinner that's easy on the wallet. Repeated visits have consistently left me content, and my latest foray with the crispy chicken atop white rice and tangy pickled vegetables did not disappoint. Previous indulgences include a succulent pork chop, equally satisfying.

Service here is swift, with the waitress greeting us promptly and the food arriving without delay. My weekend visit was pleasantly smooth, with no lines to dampen the experience—a rarity worth noting. While this establishment won't win accolades for decor, it stands out for delivering solid, tasty meals at a fair price. It's a straightforward choice for good food in Chinatown and has earned its place on my shortlist of regular haunts.",1
10536,Had been thinking of trying it for a very long time and when my buddy suggested this place couldn't say no. After all how can one say no to the great Morimoto. Wouldn't say I was overly happy however service was 5* and decor again 5*.Coming to food: the ramen was great and the broth was something to remember although I had the cold ramen(forgot the name ).The pork was juicy and tender and had flavours all through it.The fried pigs ear was okay and became a little chewy after sometime.Had the gyoza and it although was good but nothing to remember and I felt a lil disappointed as it is a restaurant by Morimoto whom i can say am a bit crazy about and follow a bit religiously. Over all would say 4*. I can definitely see this place as a kind of a 3rd or 4th date or a casual meetup place among friends. Having a reservation will definitely help.,0
15943,Awesome little Italian place with fantastic thin crust pizza and excellent service. Stopped in and took a seat at the bar. I was immediately greeted by and friendly and cheerful bartender. Ordered the house salad and a slice of marinara and cheese pizza. Both were excellent! Also had the Ommegang White and it was equally good. Price was reasonable for Manhattan. Definitely worth a look.,0
17547,"I came here in part due to my university discount, but I'm so glad I discovered this new establishment!The pork pan fried dumplings were crispy and full of meat and flavor, and crab rangoon, which I honestly have never had before, was good too. I think my uni might have done a mix up, because I noticed the ""crab rangoon,"" listed on our promotions flyer, didn't taste much like crab; it appears on Baji Baji's menu that the restaurant does serve cream cheese wontons...which would make more sense.They seem to have a variety of Chinese food options, so you know you can get some solid Chinese staple foods here in a clean, friendly environment. I didn't try anything else, but I'll definitely return at some point, and it certainly makes me miss living in East Village. :')I like how one side of the wall is interactive, for customers to write messages they want in chalk, and the other is covered in cute Chinese-culture cartoon art. I also appreciated the employee behind the desk suggesting I sit closer to the cartoon wall to be warmer, as the other end of the table was in the line of the doorway (it was freezing that day).",0
13128,"The short: super cute, impressive, delicious spot right in the heart of midtown. It was super lively around dinner time-- so great for big groups or a casual dinner date. The longer: we made a reservation & 5 of us came on a Wednesday evening. We were seated right away and our waitress was super attentive. We started with the homemade mozzarella. Epic. Seriously worth ordering. I had the brick chicken with a side of Brussels sprouts. Solid quality meal, and would definitely eat it again. I tried a few bites of my friends' risotto and pasta dishes-- and was very impressed. I think every single thing we ate here was a home run. I would definitely come back to try some drinks/happy hour & highly recommend.",0
14917,"Title: Vibrant Eats, Boisterous Beats at [Restaurant Name]

Last night was a delightful girls' night out at [Restaurant Name] where the culinary experience was nothing short of amazing. We indulged in a round of Aperol spritzes followed by a tantalizing salmon tartare, a perfectly cooked duck confit (albeit a tad salty), and a delectable rainbow trout. The accompanying salad was a standout, featuring unique dried oranges that added an unexpected twist.

However, be warned: the ambiance is extremely lively, bordering on uproarious. Nestled on the edge of the restaurant, our conversation was a shouting match against the blaring music and fellow patrons. Not the spot for whispering sweet nothings or sharing secrets.

While the flavors were worth savoring, the night did come with a steep price tag, with entrees hovering around the $30 mark. A special occasion spot, perhaps, but for those seeking a quiet, cozy dinner, you might want to look elsewhere.",1

Tried the achari panner, veggie roll and unda roll...all were dry and stuffing tasted raw. There was no flavor overall and there were hardly any fillings. The bread/paratha looked burnt on one of the roll.. My wife had one bit and left the rest ! Guess this place has definitely gone down in terms of the quality of the food. Had kathi roll at couple of other places around town and definitely feel this place is just over hyped now !  The only plus point was the order came out quick.",0

1107,"Title: Disappointing Service Overshadows Dining Experience

My visit to the restaurant was marked by a series of service letdowns that dampened the dining experience. Regrettably, the staff's attentiveness left much to be desired, with their unprofessional demeanor setting a negative tone from the beginning. Appetizers, a cornerstone of the meal's start, became the crux of my frustration; my order for Empanadas was somehow lost in communication, yet the staff, including the manager, failed to acknowledge their oversight, insisting I had never placed the order.

Such a dismissive response is not something one expects when dining out. To add insult to injury, our patience was further tested when we had to repeatedly request the check, despite the restaurant not being busy. It's a shame that the service did not match up to the standards of their much cozier location on 1st Ave, which I've found delivers far better service. In light of this, I am hesitant to recommend this establishment.",1
20389,"Title: A Thai Delight at Up Thai

My recent visit to Up Thai was nothing short of a culinary revelation. Despite a bustling atmosphere that required a bit of a wait, the experience proved to be absolutely worth it. The lunch special, a vibrant mix of vegetable soup and edamame beans followed by a Panang curry, was a standout. The moment the curry neared my lips, my taste buds awakened in anticipation, and the first bite confirmed the excitement—an explosion of perfectly balanced flavors. Each spoonful was a joy, so much so that I savored every bit of my meal, even beyond the point of fullness.

Accompanying the spice was a continuous reach for water, yet this did nothing to diminish the enjoyment. At around $15, the cost was a bargain for such high-quality fare. Up Thai delivered a fantastic dining experience that showcased the joy of Thai cuisine. I'm eagerly looking forward to my next visit. For anyone in the vicinity, this restaurant is a must-try.",1
10591,"Title: Central Elegance with a Standard Steakhouse Fare

Nestled in the heart of the city, this restaurant offers both convenience and a visually stunning dining environment. Its unique character and ambiance set it apart, yet at its core, it remains akin to your typical steakhouse, with a tendency to lean towards the pricier side.

My experience with the chili-rubbed Ribeye was satisfactory, though the dish didn't entirely justify its $61 price tag. The accompanying sides were competent, but like the main, they felt overpriced relative to their quality.

For those who enjoy a glass of red to complement their steak, be prepared for a limited selection unless you're willing to splurge. The wine list kicks off at the steep $100 mark and escalates quickly, lacking options for patrons seeking a more modestly priced bottle around $75 – a price point that would satisfy many while still being profitable.

While eye-catching options such as A5 Japanese wagyu and the Snake River Farms American crossbred wagyu are on the menu, consider the value proposition; these might be better savored when prepared in the comfort of one's home.

In essence, while the restaurant impresses on location and aesthetics, when it comes to value, the experience doesn't quite match the expense.",1
11678,"Title: Quirky Eats Right Off the PATH

I approached the burger joint with a hint of skepticism, especially after seeing photos of their mac 'n' cheese-topped burgers - not exactly my idea of appetizing! I'm not a big burger enthusiast, so thankfully, there's more variety on the menu.

I settled on the bacon mac 'n' cheese, which, to my surprise, was rather enjoyable. It deviated from the usual overly buttery and cheesy fare I’m accustomed to but was nonetheless tasty in its own right. My companion opted for the fried chicken mac 'n' cheese and the pepperoni pizza burger - the former was a standout with its perfectly breaded chicken, making me regret not including some in my dish. The latter was deemed simply ""okay.""

Price-wise, the portions served are a fair deal. Though I missed out this time, I've set my sights on trying their fries on a future visit.

A heads-up to potential patrons: the place is cozy, to put it mildly, and lacks a restroom, but its proximity to the PATH train is a plus for those coming from New Jersey. Despite its quirks, this spot is definitely worth a try for its unique takes on classic comfort food.",1
18198,"Title: A Delightful First Encounter with Dry Pot

My dining experience at this charming restaurant tucked away in the theater district was a revelation, particularly my introduction to dry pot. The concept is simple yet brilliant: a customizable mix of veggies or beef for a reasonable price, with the option to set your desired spice level. Our medium spice choice hit the perfect note of heat.

For just $11 and $13 a pound for vegetables and beef respectively, the portions were generous, easily satisfying two of us. Served with fluffy rice and topped with fresh cilantro (which I'll skip next time, out of personal taste), the dry pot alone would have been a complete meal.

We indulged further with the recommended braised pork and the beef malatang, a new experience for me. The pork belly was succulent and abundant, making for an inevitable doggy bag situation. The malatang's Sichuan-infused broth was exceptional, though a smaller portion would suffice as a side dish in the future.

To accompany our meal, the unique plum juice and aromatic herbal tea were refreshing choices, each leaving its own memorable impression.

In a nutshell, this restaurant is a serene getaway from the hustle of Times Square, offering an intimate setting to enjoy innovative and fulfilling dishes. A return visit is unquestionably in the cards.",1
14479,"Came here for brunch on Sunday. The decor is so cool with hipster Indian feels. The menu features many fun unique items that are not traditional Indian dishes.

13894,"Out of all of the places we could have chosen for brunch while staying in Manhattan, I'm sad we chose The Smith. We went on a Friday, and despite being practically empty, the service was not good. The food was just ok. I went with a mushroom and spinach omelet that was served with some greens, and it just didn't taste fresh at all. The greens were wilted and there was nothing special about the omelet. My husband did enjoy his pancakes, but we both agree that this place is definitely not worth going back to.",0
2782,It's very goofy they decorated the dining room for Lunar New Year when it's Victorian style overall. I came here for lunch and ordered Farro bowl with shrimp. There were not many people at noon but it still took them 10min to notice that no one served me yet. The farro bowl was pretty delicious but the shrimps were way too salty. The quality just didn't justify the price.,0
2358,"Ordered delivery of Carnitas nachos to my job and they arrived a few minutes after my delivery time. The nachos looked great and there was also a small container of what appeared to be black beans on the side. Strange, I never saw that, was this a mistake? Anyhow I opened it and what was stranger is there were no beans in it...just black bean sauce, not soup because it wasn't thick. I don't know, utter confusion. Moving on, the portion is for 2 or one really hungry person. The meat was very tasty and there was a good amount of it however I was very disappointed there was no guacamole or jalapeños and there was no description of toppings on the site.",0
1447,"Title: A Soba-rific Experience at Soba Totto

If you’re craving a meal that satisfies your indulgence yet keeps the guilt at bay, Soba Totto in NYC is your go-to spot. Nestled comfortably away from the hustle of Ktown, my friend and I embarked on a mini-trek to this soba haven and were pleasantly surprised with an immediate seating around 9pm.

The menu presented a tantalizing array of choices but the pork belly and chicken yakitori caught our attention from the get-go. I took the plunge with the plain soba, a nod to my skipped gym session, and it did not disappoint. The soba was impeccably fresh, free from the greasy heaviness you might find elsewhere.

Each bite of the yakitori offered a mouthwatering dance of flavors, perfectly complementing the lightness of the noodles. Service was a breath of fresh air, with attentive staffers who brought a touch of humor to our evening. The relaxed atmosphere allowed for a leisurely dining experience without the nudge towards the door.

In conclusion, Soba Totto earns an enthusiastic A for its fresh fare, delightful service, and warm ambience. A return visit is definitely on the horizon for those days when nothing but a bowl of their sublime soba will do.",1
3371,"I recently dined at a Cambodian restaurant in NYC that truly impressed me with both its culinary authenticity and its warm hospitality. The grilled noodles, or kuy teav, were a standout, showcasing perfectly charred beef and high-heat cooked noodles reminiscent of the vibrant street food scene in Cambodia. Their signature grilled amok, while more polished than what I savored in Siem Reap, still captured the essence of the dish beautifully. Decor and ambiance added to the delightful experience, enhanced by the genuinely friendly Khmer staff. It's a joy to see Cambodian cuisine so well-represented and celebrated in the heart of New York City.",1
1430,"Popped in here for a 2 person reservation at the bar. It's located at the edge of Little Italy, and they have a small but busy spot. Wood fire pizza ovens open to see as the people work on the pizzas in front of you.We had the appetizer of a littleneck clam pizza - the crust is super-thin at the center and bubbles up at the edges (thicker). It's interesting, garlicky, but I don't like burnt (blackened) crust at all, so not to my favor.The tortelloni (corbezzolo honey,almond and castelmagno cheese) was fantastic - 7 pieces, though, so not a lot. The strozzapreti w/ octopus sugo was ok (pasta good, a little spicy), but the octopus was a little on the mushy side, fell apart a little too easily and lacked the slightly chewy texture that I prefer from my octopus. They have half bottles and full, and they were efficient with replacing plates and serving - not quite rushed but not quite relaxing, either.Overall a busy place - I see why people like it, but I'm not a fan of blackened pizza, and the tortelloni was great.",0

2226,"Title: A Cozy Ramen Retreat in the Heart of NY

Just steps from our hotel in bustling New York, we stumbled upon a quaint ramen haven that boasted a relaxed vibe, perfect for a post-flight dinner. The restaurant was pleasantly uncrowded, allowing us to choose between comfy bar stools and cozy tables.

The menu featured a delightful array of ramen options at reasonable prices—even if a tad higher for us Canadians due to the exchange rate. Our experience kicked off with refreshing cold water served in metal cups, a thoughtful touch on a bustling city evening.

We indulged in fried oysters that arrived freshly made, sporting the ideal ratio of crispy coating to succulent seafood, sans any hint of greasiness. My choice, the Bow Chili ramen, was a revelation with its ground chicken, peppery arugula, salted egg, luscious pork belly, and a broth that balanced sweetness with a gentle chili heat—thoroughly satisfying without being overpowering.

My husband's classic Tonkatsu ramen hit all the right notes with perfectly fatty pork belly and a depth of flavor that hinted at the careful charring of ingredients. And for a unique twist, the selection of drinks like Japanese peach water gave us a taste of something exotic.

In conclusion, for quality and value in the heart of Manhattan, this little ramen spot is a touchdown for both weary travelers and locals alike.",1
19849,"07.10.2019H and I stopped here for pre-show dinner. She's the best date!  Grilled cheese and tater tots. Who can ask for more? We both ordered a classic grilled cheese and an order of shop tots. The bread was a good size white bread and the cheese tasted like your typical American cheese. Buttered on the outside, possibly also on both sides. The bread was crisp and the crust was crunchy. The cheese was gooey and stringy when you pulled the two pieces apart. The shop tots were cooked very well topped with Parmesan cheese. They were toasty and crisp in the beginning and stayed crispy until we finished eating. Definitely a great stop for an on the go meal. Friendly employees and food made fast and fresh.",0
10982,"Honestly, the only reason I would give this place a 3 is because of their Pork Belly, Salt & Pepper Shrimp and Flunk Flink. Otherwise, I really didn't enjoy my experience year...First, we had a reservation at 6:30 PM and got there early at 6:05 PM. They said they wouldn't be able to seat us until right at 6:30 which is completely fine. At 6:40 PM, I went to ask what the status was and the girl looked at me and said, ""You're whole group isn't here yet right?"" I said, ""All 4 of us have been here since 6:05. She just said, ""Oh.. okay. We'll get you in at the next table."" I think it's pretty ridiculous that our whole party went to check in early and then they didn't seat us until 6:50 because they thought that not everyone was here. It would've been nice if they had double checked with us or something, instead of waiting for us to come and ask. I can't imagine what would've happened if we didn't go ask. We probably would've been seated at 7 something. This alone definitely was not a great start/the staff really weren't super friendly.They ended up seating us at the top where there was literally no light, except for one super dim candle. We couldn't see anything/had to shine our flashlights to see what we were actually eating. It was also in that super awkward lighting where your eyes feel like it should be able to see, so it felt like it was straining my eye to see in front of me. They were also playing some super hardcore headbanging EDM music the entire time so a combination of the lighting and music gave me a headache. That being said, the Pork Belly and Salt & Pepper Shrimp were absolutely delicious. The pork belly was super juicy, had great flavor and was cooked perfectly. The shrimp was fried with the shell on, which was interesting because I had never tried that before but it was crunchy and so tasty as well. The Flunk Flink cocktail was so good with a nice lychee flavor.The other 2 dishes I tried were the Tom Yum Soup and the Pad Thai. The soup was nothing special. The pad thai had an egg cracked on top and you would think that would be so delicious usually, but it ended up making the noodles just super soggy. Overall, if you're going to come, ask to be seated downstairs where you can actually see and get the Pork Belly, Salt & Pepper Shrimp and Flunk Flink cocktail.",0
14357,"I came here during lunch hours. I have had better Mediterranean food elsewhere. For instance in Long Island City, and in Queens.

11824,"My husband and I had dinner here last night and it was really good. We shared the following:-toro tartar: this was great. The portion is small, but that's expected with a dish like this. I really enjoyed the sauce it came in and the presentation.-yellowtail sashimi: this was good, but I don't know if I would get it again. I've had much better at places like Nobu for the same price.-big eye tuna tart: this was amazing and my favorite of the night. The tart was so crispy and the tuna was so thin and fresh. The flavors were just perfect together.-salmon ceviche: this dish was just ok. The fish was fresh but I didn't love the sauce it came in-wagyu skirt steak: this dish was very good and a pretty good size for an appetizer portion (although it's the same price as a main dish)-crispy rice with tuna: I loved this dish. It's one of the best.-spicy tuna roll: really good and I enjoyed the amount of sesame seeds it had. The only downside is that it's $18 for a normal spicy tuna roll-chocolate fondue for 2: amazing!I would definitely recommend this place, but it's a little out of the way to come back here.

1367,"TLDR: Minimalist authentic omakase experience. A new sushi bar to enjoy on the UWS. Takeda offers a genuine omakase experience for an affordable price point. While mostly traditional nigiri, expect some new things, like okizushi (pressed sushi), geoduck and rosy sea bass as part of your tasting.I had read about Takeda in last week's restaurant openings posted by Eater. There were very few reviews but I was willing to give it a try. We booked it for the following night and reserved the 09:00 PM seating.We had to wait a bit for the previous seating to finish their meal. They were only open about a week so, you have to expect a few bumps in the road.We were able to be sat directly in front of chef which was nice. He was friendly and we chatted with him a bit. The vibe here is mostly serious, a quite piano jazz plays in the background. The lady running the front of the house is a sweetheart, she was very attentive and made the experience quite enjoyable.Okay, on to the sushi. We both opted for the 14-piece + hand roll at $105. While it is $20 more than the 11-piece, I would strongly recommend you go for the larger set. Those extra 3 pieces will cost you $20 here but a la carte, they're worth around $40 at any other sushi restaurant of this caliber.The meal started with a dish of ankimo (monkfish liver). Served atop a slice of daikon, it was paired with scallions, mountain yam and a complimentary sake by chef. I love ankimo and it's typically served with ponzu only, the yam was a new experience for me. Delightfully creamy.The nigiri progression began with a piece of hirame (fluke). Nestled under was a sliver of shiso (perilla leaf), a nice refreshing first bite. The next pieces were relatively standard but delicious. A piece of tuna marinated in soy sauce, a spot prawn topped with sea urchin, then followed by well-scored piece of striped jack.The fatty tuna followed and then here's where things got interesting. The kohada (gizzard shad) was served but he placed directly under it a small bit of ginger and shiso. The latter gave this touch freshness to cut through that very fishy taste of kohada. I would've liked it without it but this was a change of pace.Next, a scallop that he placed on top of roasted seaweed. This was enjoyable but I prefer when it's paired with the seaweed to be roasted personally. At the beginning of the meal, chef was pressing sushi into a box. This is not a common style to encounter at omakase in New York, I've actually only seen this at Sushi Nakazawa personally. He had prepared saba (mackerel) pressed sushi, sliced them into individual pieces but then proceeded to slightly sear the piece before serving it. I'll be honest, saba is probably my least favorite piece to be served.. I loved this. It was crispy on the edges, it wasn't fully cooked so you still could still taste the mackerel but it was like a new take on sushi. Bravo.The rest of the meal was great. A chawanmushi (egg custard) that wowed me at the end. It was like Cracker Jacks of the sea, there was a surprise at the bottom; some white fish that was awesome. A stuffed slice of squid, orange clam, horse mackerel, I didn't want the meal to end.Those extra three pieces we mentioned earlier had their time now. A generous cut of mirugai (geoduck) wrapped around the rice with nori. That crunch as you bite into it with that wonderful chewiness. Next, a seared piece of my personal favorite, nodoguro (sea perch). If you've never had this before, you're in for a treat. I'll take seared nodoguro over toro any day of the week. Finally, a gunkan (boat looking) maki of ikura (salmon roe), quail egg and sea urchin. That richness of both the egg and sea urchin followed by the popping of all those little salmon eggs.Lastly, the ice cream (hand roll) to finish the meal. A cut of akami (lean tuna) brushed with soy sauce and paired with a shiso leaf. That touch of herbaceous freshness is the perfect way to end this meal.I don't usually write this much but I just really enjoyed this meal. I think it's a mixture of the host's hospitality, chef taking his time to make sure each piece was made just right and the fact that - nobody really knows about this place yet. It felt like you were in on something good early.If Tanoshi made omakase affordable for the UES, Takeda is here to represent the UWS. If you're venturing into omakase for the first time or you've been going a lot and don't feel like blowing your whole paycheck.. Takeda should be a stop for you. The way they described themselves was they wanted New Yorkers to experience food that Japanese eat in Japan. It's not super fancy, the external facade barely lets you know what's inside. Simply put, there's a chef behind those doors who wants to serve you a tasting of delicious sushi. Nothing more, nothing less and that's what I loved about Takeda.",0

Though slight imperfections prevent the evening from reaching the exceptional heights of some of his previous institutions, the superb cuisine and attentive service at Bouley at Home combine to craft a dining experience that is nothing short of wonderful.",1
11137,"Title: An Elevated Brunch Experience at The Refinery Rooftop

Last Saturday, my fiancé and I were treated to a surprise brunch at The Refinery Rooftop, right at noon. The crowd was lighter than expected, a rarity for a popular spot in New York, though the prices might explain the spacious ambiance—be prepared, it's on the pricey side.

Opting for an outdoor seat under a comfortable shade was a delightful choice, balancing the feel of a sunny day with the comfort of a cool retreat. The rooftop view added significantly to the atmosphere, making it a pleasant environment to unwind.

We started with a frosé, which, after a slight nudge from our waitress, we upgraded from a $5 mini to an $18 standard size. The drink was pleasantly mild, catering well to those who prefer a subtler touch of alcohol. It was decent, though not exceptional enough to convert me to a frosé enthusiast.

The brunch highlight was the cinnamon skillet—five mini cinnamon rolls that, despite their minimalistic frosting appearance, were satisfyingly covered. The salted cultured butter frosting was unexpectedly sweet, a nice touch. However, the rolls' centers were underdone for my taste, and the golden/green raisins included were a surprise that didn't quite mesh well with the rest of the flavors.

Despite the hefty price tags—$18 for a drink and $16 for the cinnamon rolls—and a few culinary quirks, the experience was positive, largely due to the exceptional setting. While the cost is steep, the view and ambiance are part of what you're paying for. It's a venue worth trying at least once for those looking for a unique brunch location in the city.",1
17199,"This place was a great nearby option while in-between shows on a Saturday night. The atmosphere was beautiful and cozy. I sat the bar and tried a little of everything. My bartender was super nice and offered some great suggestions to make me meal even better. I was treating myself so cost wasn't an option, it's a little expensive but worth the experience. I enjoyed the burger and the lobster soup. The old fashion was on point!",0
20471,"I love eating here because the pizza slices feel like an actual meal. The artichoke slice especially since it is so dense. You will come out of here feeling very sleepy and happy. Great place to grab a slice when you're drunk.The slices are pretty pricey here though so don't expect dollar prices. It is around 6$ for a slice if you take them to go. A bit more when you sit down. Don't get a soda because it's $4 for a cup of soda, which I find crazy.The place has a bar and feels like one. There are a bunch of tables at the front and 2 in the back next to the grab and go section. Every time I have gone, there has always been a wait. The wait isn't too bad since the food doesn't require you to sit longer to eat it. Even though most people love the artichoke pizza, I really like the margherita pizza slice. It is the opposite of the artichoke. Instead of being thick and dense, it's pretty thin and doesn't weigh you down. The slice is still pretty big but I like that it doesn't feel like I'm eating an entire bowl of pasta.Overall, I think this place is a great place to go, especially after strolling down the High Line.",0
14950,Great location for a pizza shop. I came here for lunch and margarita was $12. The lunch menu had 5-6 more lunch specials at the same price. The place is cozy and I would consider coming back for dinner. The pizza came out fairly fast and it was good. Little burnt on the top but still good. The waitress there was super friendly and helpful.,0
15350,"My decision to bring a group of friends here for dinner was heavily influenced by another local friend and world traveler. He had just completed a 3-week visit to all of Georgia, and he could not stop raving about the scenery, the people, the wine, and especially the food. As you might expect, the food is somewhat in-between the cuisines of its neighbors. Georgia is also one of the first places in the world where the distilling of grapes occurred, so there is a history to their wine-making. I took and now approve of his suggestion to visit a Georgian restaurant.Dining here is a very social experience, enhanced by the wait staff, and a lot of the foods, especially the appetizers, are meant to be shared. I lost track of the number of times the folks at my table said something like, ""Can we get 6 of everything?""  Pay attention to the small print accompanying the entree list, because some of the dishes are served cold. And yet we found room for some desserts as well. Those that we ordered reminded me of simpler versions of tortes, again very rich and delicious. It was great to have this experience and to find yet another cuisine of which I'm now fond.",0
12466,"Title: A Bustling Sunday Delight with a Dash of Chill

I recently visited this lively restaurant on a bustling Sunday afternoon. The crowd was testament to its popularity, and despite the throng, my boyfriend and I snagged seats at the bar, which allowed us to bypass the wait for a table.

Our appetites were whetted by the sound of the buffalo chicken mac and cheese, hot honey chicken n' toast, and a side of French fries. True to the bartender's insinuation, the portions were generous, to say the least – a delightful surprise that made sharing an obvious choice.

Each dish was a flavorful journey, with the buffalo chicken mac and cheese striking a perfect balance between creamy and spicy. The hot honey chicken n' toast offered a sweet-heat combination that was addictively good, and the fries were the ideal crispy accompaniment.

The drinks were on par with the food; the ""Upper Westside"" cocktail was deceptively potent despite its modest size, while the strawberry margarita provided a refreshing counterpoint to our savory meal.

Mid-meal, the ambiance shifted as they dimmed the lights by the bar and queued up some classic tunes, adding to the charm was a beautifully adorned Christmas tree.

Regrettably, the experience was slightly marred by our bartender's demeanor. Her standoffish attitude was a stark contrast to the warm atmosphere, and her lack of engagement, from not presenting the receipt to omitting a simple 'thank you,' was off-putting.

Despite the service hiccup, I'm compelled to give this restaurant a solid four-star rating. The atmosphere, food, and drinks were truly outstanding. If you're looking for a great spot with ample portions and a lively vibe, this is a place you won't want to miss – just be prepared for service that might not match the otherwise excellent experience.",1
3448,"I recently dined at this great restaurant and was thoroughly impressed with the phenomenal service. The attentive staff meticulously paced our meal, ensuring we had ample time to enjoy and digest our appetizers before presenting the entrees. The food was delicious across the board, but the standout for me was the crispy fried beef—perfectly cooked with a sensational sauce that truly elevated the dish. The soup dumplings also deserve a mention for their generous size and flavorful taste. I would wholeheartedly recommend this spot to anyone looking for a top-notch dining experience—10/10 in every aspect!",1
13590,What a great find in the busy midtown Manhattan area! Beautiful great Gatsby-style bar with plenty of tables to sit in a nice space in a back. Signature and specialty cocktails are delicious. The menu is amazing and food is absolutely delicious. Service is quick and attentive. They have a space upstairs as well that would be good for a holiday party. Really fun spot to grab a drink and a bite after work. Cocktails are a bit pricey but are worth it. They also have a happy hour that runs until 7pm.,0
10303,"We came and were seated immediately with no wait. Got the meat sampler for two with Beg Alicia (lamb), Doro Wat (chicken), Shiro Wat (chickpea purée), Gomez (collard greens). The Beg Alicha was too chewy for my taste, but the Doro Wat was super tender and moist with great spicy sauce. I also recommend the Shiro Wat, very amiable. Not sure if I personally don't like collard greens but a little too vinegary for my taste. The food came and quickly and our server replaced our bread often. You could almost feed 2 people with the amount of good we got. I've definitely had better Ethiopian good but it's good if you need a fix.",0
19586,"More like Hecklebees, when I'm writing the review, because f*** it's sooooooooooo bad fammm.Probably my least favorite Applebee's location because my god it's taking up such a massive space right in the heart of Midtown Manhattan.It's so sad what has happened to New York. Giuliani can f***ing do one.The chains have really taken over, and Applebee's is the exemplary (read: worse of all) one as it is so massive and so prominent. Makes me pretty depressed actually.The food is utterly atrocious and should never be eaten by anyone ever.",0
16400,"Really liked this place. Our waitress was very friendly and was attentive despite being extremely busy. Our orders were delivered quickly and correctly. We got burgers, nachos, and the grilled chicken wrap and everyone enjoyed their orders. This is nothing fancy or upscale. It's more like a bar with food, than a restaurant with a bar, if that makes sense! They had a gluten free bun available which was nice (but a bit pricey at $4). Do keep in mind they just have beer and wine, no liquor. They had a pretty expensive beer list though. I will definitely go back sometime!",0
14373,"Gyu-kaku has one of the most amazing lunch special/happy hour deals in the city. The lunch special here runs from Monday-Thursday and for a little more than $10, you get to order an entire set: miso soup, salad, white rice, and 4 types of deliciously marinated meat. I ordered the $10.95 value set which had chicken, pork and beef. If you are a moo moo beef fan, I recommend the $12.95 meat lovers set. My friends absolutely loved it! We also ordered a few drinks including the Lychee Gin Mojito, Mango Tango and the Tokyo Iced Tea. The happy hour special was going on, meaning each drink was only ~$5! I tried all three and the Tokyo Iced Tea is definitely the strongest. I needed two to start getting into my happy dance mood hehe.The food here was spectacular, but overall, there definitely could've been improvements. For example, I waited over 20 minutes for my second drink and while our server apologized, it definitely slowed the momentum of the meal. Also, my friend ordered mushrooms at the beginning of the meal but never received it. Upon checking in with the server, we found that the order was never put in. Little details like that really do make a restaurant go from pretty good to outstIf you've never been to Japanese bbq before, I highly recommend you try it! Bbq can dig into your wallet pretty deeply, but Gyukaku's lunch menu is so affordable and oh so delicious.",0
16225,"My boyfriend found Barn Joo on Yelp last year when he was in town for work and hasn't stopped talking about his meal here, so naturally I had to take my family this week while in town. H O L Y C O W it totally lived up to the hype he created!! We showed up at 5pm with a party of 8 and were seated right away. Our waitress was awesome - informative, confident, polite, and attentive. We got an array of appetizers and happy hour drinks, including soy garlic wings, truffle fries, fried veggie dumplings, a tiger sushi roll, and crispy chicken buns. Wings were just $1 for happy hour which is a steal because they were big and perfectly cooked. The dumplings were huge and overstuffed, the fries and spicy mayo were amazing, the sushi was FANTASTIC, and the crispy chicken buns were ""the best I've ever had"", according to my mom's post on Facebook. And she would know, since she lived in Korea. For dinner, we pretty much all got hot stone bowls except for one person, who had a mussel and oyster hot pot - HUGE portion and huge pieces as well, absolutely worth the money. The hot stone bowls had wild rice instead of white, which threw me off at first but ended up being a great texture. The mushrooms in the vegetarian bowl were amazing, and my chicken was cooked perfectly. I would highly recommend Barn Joo to anyone looking for a good happy hour, good tapas to share, or great Korean food.",0
13214,"Playa Betty's offers a vibrant dining experience perfect for both brunch and dinner. The outdoor seating adds a delightful touch during warm weather, and the margaritas are a standout.

11924,"I almost don't want to write this review as this is my little gem in Chinatown and I don't want to end up waiting for ages in queues by letting this secret out. It is a hole in the wall selling freshly made rice rolls for very decent prices (read: less than $3 depending on what you order). You go up to the front window and tell the lady what you would like. The lady would make your rice noodles fresh and packs it into a container; you will then have the option to garnish the noodles with any sauce you like ranging from chilli, soy, sweet soy and peanut. Make sure the noodle is eaten straight away nearby whilst it is still pipping hot. Finding a place to sit would be difficult but everyone seems to quickly eat it whilst standing on the pavement. The place seems to sell other things such as tofu and dumplings to go as well.",0
18108,"As a native of Canton with discerning tastes, I rarely venture out to try Cantonese cuisine outside of a select few establishments in New York. August Gatherings, however, stands as a commendable exception. The culinary creativity, flavorful dishes, and appealing presentation all meet high expectations. Admittedly, prices are steep by Chinatown standards, with vegetables starting at $20 and meat dishes soaring above $40, leading to an estimated $50 per person for a shared meal.

Highlighting the menu are four exquisite dishes, available only by reservation 24 hours in advance. It would be remiss not to recommend the succulent roasted Angus short rib—a signature must-try. Other notables include the honey roasted Berkshire pork, the classic roasted duck, tender baked clams, the aromatic steam chicken with porcini, perfectly steamed fish, and the indulgent fried oyster truffle noodle.

The daily special soup is also a noteworthy addition, offering an incredible taste experience. For those looking for a more casual and economical option, the $9 lunch special provides a satisfactory quick fix that doesn't compromise on taste. August Gatherings, despite its premium pricing, delivers an authentic Cantonese culinary adventure that's well worth the expense.",1
15573,"Tucked behind the facade of a charming pawn shop lies a true gem that offers a bona fide New York experience. Ideal for impressing clients or treating out-of-town friends, this destination spot captivates with its unique blend of secrecy and authenticity. The thrill of stepping through a trove of trinkets and antiques into the bustling eatery within is a delightful surprise that never gets old.

Once inside, the experience only improves. The service is attentive, the ambiance is vibrant, and each dish is a testament to the exceptional culinary standard set by the establishment. While my memory fails to serve the exact details of our spread, the bone marrow stands out as a memorable highlight. Everything that graced our table was delicious, leaving an impression that this is not just dining, but a masterful performance for the senses. A must-visit for anyone seeking to savor the essence of New York City dining.",1
14274,"Title: An Experience Over Epicurean Delight at Unagi New York

Upon visiting Unagi New York, it's clear you're in for an experience rather than a culinary revelation. The highlight begins with the theatrics of having their unagi, flown in daily from Japan, presented before being cooked to your preference. I opted for the softer, boiled then grilled unagi topped with uni, which added a luscious creaminess, though I found the dish overwhelmed by excessive rice.

The intriguing 'unagi three-way' offers a more engaging dining adventure. It includes a DIY hand roll (with a helpful tutorial from the waiter), a unique unagi soup, and a delightful unagi omelette that encases the eel in fluffy egg goodness. However, the real star of the show was the matcha pudding dessert—its impeccable creaminess and robust matcha essence left a more lasting impression than the main act.

Be prepared to invest in the experience—and the eel's trans-Pacific journey—with the understanding that while the food is decent, it's the dessert and novelty that might just justify the expense.",1
20132,"The first time I came here was two years ago and I honestly can't remember much. This time, I ordered the Madame Freda and Jack's Breakfast. The space is quite tight, and the noise level was quite loud. Because it was hard to hear the conversation, as well as how close the tables were positioned next to each other, I took one star away. The food was genuinely great. The service was nice and the brunch came in a speedy manner. The duck was a nice touch in the Madame Freda, as I've never had something like that before. The egg was the perfect level of soft but not a sunny side up, which I very much appreciate. The steak was juicy and tender, with the right amount of bite. I love brunch and this is a great spot to stop at.",0
12257,Great place for Mexican food and drinks! I came here with some coworkers and we enjoyed our meal here. I got a pineapple drink that comes in a pineapple and liked it a lot!

11163,"A friend recommended this place a few months ago and we finally went today. I'm so glad I came here because the burger is probably one of the best I've had. The butcher shop next door opened their own restaurant, everything is a locally sourced and organic; you can taste it in the food.We ended up getting the H&C classic, which was an 8oz patty with the special sauce; the patty was perfectly cooked and tasted delicious. My friend ended up getting the Catalina special, which came with 2x 4oz patties and the Catalina sauce. The burger was good but had way too much sauce. This was a great place and the quality of the food was amazing. Definitely will come back and try the other burgers!",0
1704,"I had an overall great experience here.I am giving it five stars mainly due to the Black Truffle Gnocchi, which was inspiring in its creaminess, its flavor, and its richness. I just loved the sauce so much that I was using the pizza crust to dip it in the sauce even after we had finished the gnocchi pieces. I also had the Borbone pizza. It was nice but it did not wow me in the way that the gnocchi did. I think if I were to come again, I'd consider a white sauce pizza.",0
3304,"Title: A Tapas Triumph with a Hint of Intrusion

I recently visited a tapas restaurant that left a lasting impression. The discovery came courtesy of a friend, and what a find it was! Although the happy hour was limited to their drink selection, the pitcher of sangria we ordered was a steal at $18 and quite possibly one of the best I've enjoyed recently.

We indulged in four tapas: the bravas, shrimp, grilled lamb skewers, and stuffed peppers. Each dish was a showcase of culinary excellence—flavorful, perfectly cooked, and utterly satisfying.

Service-wise, we experienced top-notch attention. However, there was a slightly off-putting detail: the waitress seemed to check on us excessively, to the point where it disrupted the flow of our evening. Despite this minor glitch, the overall experience was so delightful that I'm already planning my next visit.",1
17766,"Title: A Chinese Feast in the Heart of Manhattan's Chinatown

Upon my recent visit to an acclaimed eatery nestled in the vibrant Chinatown of Manhattan, I was struck by its suitability for just about any celebration, especially for those with a penchant for Chinese cuisine. The restaurant exudes a warm ambiance that complements its prime locale, easily accessible and perfect for a culinary adventure.

Admittedly, the experience was slightly marred by a delay in seating despite our reservation for an ample party of twenty, causing a brief ten-minute wait. Once seated, we noticed the finishing touches were still being added to our tables, and there was a minor oversight in the cleanliness of some glassware and silverware, hinting at a possible rush on the staff's part.

However, the pre-fixed menu quickly redirected our attention. It was nothing short of delicious, boasting flavorful dishes that pleased both vegetarian and pescatarian palates. Each course was a delightful encounter with traditional Chinese flavors, served with gusto and generosity.

In summary, while there were a few hitches in service, the quality and variety of the food ensured a satisfying experience for all.",1
13253,"Title: A Koreatown Disappointment

Walking into a nearly deserted restaurant on the bustling main street of Koreatown at prime dinner time should have been the first red flag. However, fatigue from a long work day and the chill in the air led us to overlook the obvious and take a chance on a place we recalled as decent from a visit over a year ago.

The ambience, marred by the inattentive hostess who seemed more engrossed in personal entertainment than customer service, set the tone for an underwhelming dining experience. After being seated among the sparse diners, we were left to our own devices, our presence seemingly unnoticed until we initiated the interaction to place our orders.

Contrastingly, the busser/back waiter was the establishment's saving grace, displaying the attentiveness and work ethic sorely lacking in his colleague. It was to him that we directed our appreciation and gratuity, separate from the default service charge which we felt the primary server hadn't earned at all.

As for the cuisine, the pork and vegetable ramen and chicken and egg don with their ""special sauce,"" delivered on taste but couldn't quite make up for the overall lackluster experience. Despite my husband enjoying his ramen, no culinary feat could undo the impression left by the neglectful service.

Conclusively, our once ""not as bad"" memory of this restaurant has now been replaced with a resolution, channeled through Taylor Swift's wisdom: ""We are never getting back together.""",1
10380,"On our quest for dessert after dinner, my friends and I stopped here. This place is separated into two different restaurants but share the same space, similar to Dunkin Donuts and Baskin Robins. There's a separate seating area for the restaurant TIBERIAS, while there is seating near the window for HOLY CREPE. There are quite a few options on the crepe menu. I ended up getting the nutella, crushed Oreo, and banana crepe. It was delicious except for the fact that the Oreos were really stale.Would've been perfect if it wasn't for that. The two friends I was with got the strawberry, Nutella and graham cracker crepe. We all wiped our plates clean, it was delicious! No complaints about the service, our waiter was very sweet",0
20643,"I recently visited this renowned restaurant for a traditional Chinese New Year banquet with my family, eager to indulge in the much-praised seafood offerings. The culinary experience lived up to its reputation - from the succulent lobster salad to the tender abalone, flavorful shrimp, unique sea cucumber, earthy mushrooms, perfectly steamed fish, and the comforting touch of fried rice, each dish was a symphony of flavors.

However, the spatial arrangement fell slightly short of comfort as the tables were crammed into the long, narrow space of the restaurant. Additionally, the placement of the restroom downstairs might be inconvenient for some guests.

While the service was impressively quick, it bordered on feeling rushed, detracting from the leisurely enjoyment of the feast. Despite these minor inconveniences, the food was the true star of the evening and did not disappoint, ensuring a memorable celebration.",1
11975,"Just what we were looking for! We wanted a farm-to-table breakfast in NYC. Rustic Table isn't a large place. It has an intimate and charming atmosphere. The staff is super friendly.

Anticipated what we might need for condiments and convenience, such as extra napkins, etc.                                                  We came for breakfast. I noticed some other reviewers complained of a limited menu, but we found many delicious options. I had a great meal--without wrecking my WW diet--which was important since I just reached a milestone! My husband did have one peeve. He said his latte was slightly bitter. He's picky because he makes us lattes every morning at home, but I enjoyed my coffee. The dessert was a rosewater pudding called Malabi, which we both loved! Thanks, Rustic Table!

Each bite was a flavor-packed testament to authenticity.

The crowd was evident, a testament to its popularity, but the efficiency of the service was impeccable—swift lines and even quicker food service.

They don't have tap water so I threw in a bottled water too, and it was about $16 for all that which I found pricey. Pizza is NY style pizza and was tasty, but could have been warmer. They're also very large, I probably would have been fine with only one slice. They were unfortunately out of garlic knots. They have a tiny bathroom for customers, in the basement.I'd probably seek out another pizza place next time but it was good at the time.",0

Highly recommend for a cozy and memorable dining experience.",1
10374,"Officially a big fan of Ping's. I came here for both a dinner and for dimsum. Glad I can opine on both and both will get 5 stars for me. Dinner - ordered an assortment of dishes including snails, fried frog legs, golden fried rice, steamed fish and crispy chicken. Everything was really good and easy to share between 6 people. We brought a bottle of wine where they charge a corking fee but found it worth it for 6 people just to pop our own cheap bottle. I think the only dish I wasn't a crazy fan of was the duck tongue. Duck tongue was cooked really well but it was on a bed of pickled vegetables that made it sour. Not the best pairing.Dimsum - come early because it could get crowded just like any other dim sum place. They carry their dimsum in trays given the size of the restaurant. I thought there would have been delays in service but honestly the serving of plates was super quick. We got everything we wanted, quick and easy. They were very good on going to tables and showing what they had with good variety. They also have a menu with pictures of all their dim sum plates which is great for none Cantonese people. All the plates were really good, just as good as any other dimsum place. I think what made this place shine though for me was their service. I think this was the first dimsum place that has ever refilled my water consistently. They only accept cash or Amex.",0
2755,"Title: Quick Service and Eco-Friendly Packaging Shine

I recently dined at a local eatery that struck a chord with me on several notes. I'd rate the food at a solid 3.5 stars—it's pretty good overall. The standout for me was the freshness of their proteins, especially the chicken. Whether grilled or prepared in other ways, the chicken was tender, flavorful, and made for a satisfying meal.

The efficiency of service deserves a mention with a 4-star rating. Despite the typically long lines around lunchtime, I found a great workaround by ordering ahead through the Ritual app, allowing me to skip the wait entirely—a real time-saver for anyone on a tight schedule.

One commendable practice I appreciated was their use of recyclable containers. It's a minor $1 upcharge on your first purchase, but it's a small price to pay for environmental sustainability. It's an initiative I'd love to see more patrons supporting.

While I'm still on the hunt for a salad that wins me over, this place has impressed me enough during my two visits to keep it on my radar. If you value fresh ingredients, quick service, and eco-friendly options, this might just be your new go-to spot.",1

To me it felt like, whichever dish would have tasted equally good with truffle racelette. Generally I don't eat a lot of cheese, so this dish was good for two people. I alone couldn't have finished it. I also went for the fig tartine, which was also very delicious. I recommend that too. The bread had extra gluten which made the crust chewy though.",0
16669,"Title: A Buzzing Brunch Spot with Room for Patience

I recently had the joy of experiencing brunch at this vibrant eatery, a visit I had been eagerly anticipating. The occasion was a friend's birthday celebration at 2:30 pm, and the place certainly didn't disappoint in atmosphere, pulsing with energy upon entry. However, patience is essential, as a limited number of hostesses manage the flow of guests, which can lead to a wait.

Once inside, IDs are checked – a reminder to keep yours handy. Though we were initially seated by the drafty entrance, the staff was accommodating when we requested a warmer spot. Prompt service ensured our glasses were quickly filled with a variety of beverages, including mimosas, Bellini, and champagne; the only slight disappointment was the diluted white sangria.

The wait for food was noticeable, but the meal was ultimately satisfying. My well-done steak needed a touch more cooking to truly match the description, but with steak sauce, it was delightful. Accompaniments included a salad, home fries, and cheesy scrambled eggs – all flavorful, though portions could have been more generous considering the price.

In summary, while the experience isn't without its minor flaws, the lively ambiance and tasty offerings make a return visit a tempting notion before year's end—perhaps once or twice for special occasions.",1
18672,"I recently visited The Golden Unicorn for a dim sum breakfast and was pleasantly satisfied with the experience.

11935,"Food: Very Good (4 of 5).Service and Atmosphere: OK (3 of 5). Value: OK (3 of 5).If I had to name a Top 10 list of ramen joints in New York City, Ichiran would probably make it to my list on the basis of food quality alone. I was very impressed by my visit to Ichiran Midtown. Their ""Recommended Set"" is superb. The broth was rich and complex, the ramen egg and noodles were perfect. That said, I have two issues with the restaurant. First, I'm not a fan of Ichiran's distinctive cubicle-style seating. Although the seating is intended to encourage a focus on the food, I found the cubicles to be narrow and not particularly comfortable. The booth stools seem to be unadjustable. There are hooks underneath the left and right side of the table to the left and right to hang your bags; utilizing the hooks for such purposes reduces available leg room.Second, Ichiran is pretty expensive for ramen. While customers don't need to pay tips here, there are other ramen shops in Manhattan that offer great ramen, at a lower total cost. Aside from getting a seat assignment for your meal and paying your bill after your meal at the entrance of the restaurant, there is no face-to-face interaction with the staff. Orders are placed by pressing a button in the cubicle and food is delivered through the cubicle's screen curtain. Customers have to peel their own ramen egg. Ichiran provides instructions on how to peel an egg, and a packaged wet wipe for cleaning one's hands before the task. Still, for the price, I would have preferred that staff handle this task; it would be more environmentally sensitive, too.Ichiran has two unisex bathrooms that are well-maintained and stocked with plenty of toilet paper.",0
14248,"Ok.  So I  know this is very much a tourist place but I had to try it.   My rating is also not just based in food taste - it's about overall experience....First off - come here knowing it's the atmosphere not the food you  are here for. We stood in line for about 20  min before heading in and got in main floor near  ""mosh pit"".  Took a while before our waiter came --- but it was because he was performing ""Be our  Guest"" from Beauty and the Beast.  Which was a fantastic experience in itself.We ordered and about 10-15 min later door came.   My Denver Omlette was ..ok. Not the best.  My friend had a Ruben and she liked that. All in we were there for a little over an hour being entertained the entire time.  If your in from out of state - this is a cool place to stop to help support up and comer performers ... would like to come back and visit again on my needy family  trip here.",0
16118,Stopped in here for a late lunch on vacation. The staff were so helpful in answering all of my questions. The portion sizes were good and priced fairly compared to the other vendors in the urban space. The ramen was hot and delicious. The bao buns were flavorful and perfect. Would definitely stop here again when I'm in town.,0

1004,"While I'm a vegan and cannot personally vouch for the taste, my husband's recent experience at this charming little shop deserves recognition. He picked up a ball of mozzarella for a bike ride snack and was thoroughly impressed. He commented without a second thought that it was an ""easy 5/5 stars."" According to him, the cheese was creamy, impeccably seasoned, and so irresistible that he polished off the entire ball in one go - a fact that I can attest to as an eyewitness. This quaint establishment certainly seems to have plenty to offer, and it's a hit with at least one cheese-loving cyclist in our family!",1
11164,"**Restaurant Review**

**Rating:** Food 4/5, Service 4/5, Ambiance 2.5/5

Tucked away in an unassuming spot lies this classic gem of a restaurant. Despite its size and inconvenient location, it is unequivocally a destination worth seeking out. The food tantalizingly echoes the comforts of a Filipino home kitchen.

The sisig, crisp and indulgently fatty, did not disappoint and secured a solid 4/5 rating. It's the kind of dish that could easily turn into a craving. The palabok, although only earning a 3/5, was presented with pleasantly al dente noodles and a satisfying crunch. As a first-timer to tortang talong, I was pleasantly surprised; the dish was juicy, spongey, and simply delightful. The soup may have tipped us over the edge in terms of quantity, but its flavors reminded me of a hearty Chinese daikon soup, comfort food in a bowl.

The dessert was a sweet lover's dream with its combination of shaved ice and ice cream, a refreshing end to a hearty meal.

Service was attentive and personable, likely bolstered by my companions' fluency in the local language. As for the ambiance, the space is small and vibrant. The location may be out of the way, but the flavors and warmth of the food are compelling reasons for a return visit. If you're seeking a taste of authentic, home-style Filipino cuisine, this is the place to go.",1
16728,"Title: Mixed Feelings at Pelicana Chicken

My recent trip to Pelicana Chicken was a quest to satisfy a Korean fried chicken craving on a casual weekday. I opted for two items—the truffle oil fries and the crispy soy garlic boneless wings—totaling around $25, not exactly cheap, but the generous portions justified the cost. A neat little discount of 10% for cash payments over $20 softened the blow at the register.

While the truffle fries maintained their reputation with a robust flavor and perfect texture—crispy exteriors meeting soft interiors—the chicken left much to be desired. In an attempt to deviate from my usual honey garlic choice, I ventured towards the soy garlic option, requesting extra crispiness, which might've been my misstep. The result was an overly dry exterior that the scant sauce did little to alleviate, and while the meat inside was passable, it lacked the tender juiciness I had come to expect from Pelicana. The flavors were decent, but saltier and less satisfying without the saucy, sweet embrace of honey garlic.

Lesson learned—stick to what you know and love, especially when it comes to comfort food. Despite the fries’ win, the chicken's off day means I'll be returning to the familiar honey garlic on my next visit.",1
11105,"I had the pleasure of dining at Dun Huang, where I was graciously invited to sample their lamb rice dish – a flavorful experience I won't soon forget. While I dined solo, the array of enticing dishes around me had me wishing for a companion to explore the menu further. Despite this, my meal was thoroughly enjoyable.

Upon check-in, I was treated to a complimentary salad, an unexpected delight that was served warm, with sesame oil enhancing the mix of ingredients – a perfect preamble to the main course.

The restaurant was bustling, even on a Monday, underscoring the need for a reservation or a quick Yelp check to avoid wait times. Given the quality of my experience, I am already looking forward to a return visit to dive deeper into their culinary offerings.",1
14867,"Title: A Mixed Bag at Baro in K-Town

Venturing into the bustling streets of K-Town can be a double-edged sword, with the unavoidable crowds adding to the area’s vibrant but sometimes overwhelming atmosphere. Baro, a popular spot among my acquaintances, was our latest dining adventure.

Despite the throng of patrons, Baro's service shone brightly. The restaurant maintained its tradition of complimentary dishes, affectionately known as ‘service,’ and this time, instead of the usual truffle fries, we were treated to mini pizzas. While not particularly noteworthy, they were a welcome freebie.

The bar didn’t disappoint either, serving up drinks with a generous hand, ensuring a merry evening for those indulging.

Our meal concluded with the clam stew, a hearty dish teeming with clams and dough pieces. Personally, a more broth-centric approach with fewer dough pieces would have been preferred for a lighter finish to the meal. Nevertheless, the stew remained a comforting and enjoyable dish.

In summary, Baro stands out for its exceptional service and solid offerings, even if some dishes could benefit from slight tweaks. Despite K-Town’s usual hustle, Baro is worth braving the crowds for.",1
10154,"Having returned from Thailand with still-tantalizing tastes in my memory, my anticipation for this restaurant was unfortunately met with disappointment. While the ambiance may catch your eye, it seems that's primarily what you're paying for – an experience that's more about the setting than the culinary journey. With prices almost twice as high as your average Thai spot, I hoped for dishes that justified the cost.

The papaya salad was lackluster, especially in comparison to the vibrant flavors I've savored at Sriphaphai in Queens. The pad kee mao was adequate, nothing to write home about, and while the pandan chicken met expectations, the special Thai crepe fell flat, both in taste and value.

I found the red curry tipping too far towards sweetness, and the heat I was promised at a ""medium"" level was conspicuously absent, leaving much to be desired for my palate that craves authentic spice.

In summary, if it's an authentic Thai experience you seek, with flavors that transport you to the bustling streets of Bangkok, I suggest passing on this establishment and making your way to stalwarts like Sriphaphai or Wondee Siam in Manhattan.",1
14569,"Title: Quick Bite Excellence Before Movie Night

I stumbled upon this charming little gem while searching for a swift dining option before catching a film. Despite its modest size, the service was impressively speedy, and the staff exuded warmth and friendliness. Diners can choose between cozying up at the bar or settling down at a table.

For starters, the gyoza and karaage fried chicken hit the spot – both appetizers were delightful. The ramen bowls, accompanied by a comforting cup of hot green tea (a steal for $2), also didn't disappoint. With a diverse ramen menu, it seems like there's no wrong choice to be made. And for those not in a noodle mood, rice dishes are also available.

I definitely intend to return and delve into more of their offerings. If you're looking for a quick and satisfying meal, this is your spot.",1
19470,"After living in New York for 11 years I finally visited Cafe Katja...Sat outside on a Sunday evening, the street was quiet and chill. Our waiter was cute and friendly.tried the Bratwurst - I'm just not a sausage person I guess, but I love the sauerkraut that came with it.Weiner Schnitzel - I'm a big schnizel fan, the buttered sauce came with it was so fatty but yummy with the schnitzel. (However for the crispiness I still love Shoo Shoo's Schnitzel more...oops)",0
16436,"I ordered through seamless from here tonight to give them a try. Delivery arrived on time and no spills. Everything arrived hot and was packed neatly. No napkins.I ordered the Bacon Bliss Burger medium rare $12.99 and the Truffle oil and Parmesan cheese fries $8.99.-The truffle parm fries were good. In the notes/instruction area I asked for them to be crispy (I like them crunchy) and they weren't but at least they tasted good. Truffle oil smelled good. Package can be opened and used as a plate which is nice.-The bacon bliss burger is described as ""loaded with bacon"" on seamless and there was only two slices on the burger (see photo). That is definitely not ""loaded."" It was not medium rare (no pink, see photo). It was more medium to medium well. Bottom bun was also soggy. Maybe from lettuce? Comes with onion, tomato, and pickles. I didn't know and it also came with a little bit of fries which I also didn't know or I wouldn't have ordered the truffle fries.More info needed on Seamless! And they shouldn't say ""loaded with bacon"" if it's only two slices. It's just a bacon burger without cheese. On the bright side, the prices are decent and it was filling. I won't be reordering though. I gave it a try and it's not for me.",0
14891,"Went back to Olio w Piú and gave it another shot, this time it was a great experience. The hostess was friendly and showed us to our table. The manager came to our table to welcome us and checked up on us once to make sure our dining experience was good. The dishes we ordered were very delicious and flavourful. The fettuccine was cooked perfectly and the Fettuccine con Astice Diavolo's flavour was a tad spicy and creamy and the texture was great. Lobster was cooked just right, I enjoyed it. My friend ordered the Salmone alla Salmoriglio and he loved it. The potato was really good and the baby spinach with salmon was a nice combination. The bread this time wasn't dry which was great but personally still wish it was fluffier. The Abbondante was okay though, taste decent but nothing memorable. I won't recommend the pizza but anything else on the menu I do recommend. The shrimp was DELICIOUS, so flavourful it's amazing. They ran out of the Semifreddo al Pistacchio was we really wanted to try, my friend was a bit disappointed. I ordered the orange panna cotta was to my surprise was spectacular! It's much more firm than any panna cotta I've had in my life but it's so good I wanted second! It's still not a place I'd frequent plus it's on the pricier side but it's a place I'd visit again from time to time. It's nice so a date or family or catching up with friends. Earlier in the evening it's pretty nice but later in the evening the atmosphere is decent but gets pretty noisy it's a bit hard to hear unless you're sitting outside. I'd recommend to check out this place and I'd like to come back again to try out their brunch menu this time.",0
20649,"Used the Ritual app to order lunch here on a Monday afternoon. Usually a semi-long line with the promise of a healthy alternative to pizza.Wasn't in the mood for a slice, so settled instead on the Vegetarian Wheel Piada ($3.55) and the 6-piece Wings ($8). Food takes about 15ish minutes to come out and they ended up forgetting the wings (was able to go back and pick it up quickly). Piada looks like a crusty quiche with cooked veggies inside. Slightly burnt taste and not much flavor (could have used some sauce). Wings are greasy and are essentially ""naked"", needing a lot of help from the hot sauce provided.Disappointed in this place as neither item I ordered was all that great. Maybe need to try the pizza instead.",0
1026,"I visited this restaurant on a Friday evening and was pleasantly surprised by the lack of wait time. As someone concerned about the authenticity of the food for my friend visiting from Korea, I can attest that this place did not disappoint—she heralded the cuisine as some of the best she's had stateside. The meal portions provided good value for the price, although a $5 charge for a side of rice did seem a tad steep. The naan bread was a highlight, perfectly baked and flavorful. We savored both a paneer dish and a chicken entrée, each impressively executed. Overall, a commendable dining experience.",1
16530,"Tucked away in a cozy corner, this little spot offers fresh, homemade tacos that won't break the bank. However, while the prices are agreeable, the chicken taco left me wanting more with its less-than-generous filling. The veggie option, on the other hand, was reminiscent of overdone Chinese takeout, heavy on the celery which could be off-putting for some. Be prepared to order several – somewhere between two to four – to satisfy your hunger. Despite these quirks, I see potential here and plan to return for the lunch specials. It's a welcome change of pace from the usual cheap pizza slices and food cart fare.",1
18144,"I recently visited a charming little bakery that has quickly become one of my favorite spots. The standout for me was their turkey baguette sandwich - perfectly heated so that the baguette is crispy on the outside while remaining delightfully soft within. 

Their macarons are exceptional too, with the Bailey's-flavored one being a personal favorite. Seating is limited and, given its location in a bustling tourist area, it's often packed. But don't let that deter you – grab your food, find a nearby bench, or watch the ice skaters while savoring your treats with their excellent coffee. A delightful experience not to be missed!",1

1933,"They have really delicious chicken sandwiches. I've had the fried chicken, the buffalo chicken, and the limited edition spicy chicken bacon ranch! I was going to give four stars at first because while the buffalo chicken was delicious, I don't feel like it traveled well. I was kind of underwhelmed when I got it back to my office. But the spicy chicken ranch that I had the next day more than made up for it! It was amazing and kept me so full. I didn't even get a side and this was more than enough for lunch. I've also had the cheeseburger melt which was very good and the cheese tots. I will be going back for the Nutella milkshake at some point.",0
15543,"Overall: 3.5 starsWe had a dinner reservation for 7 people a few days ago to celebrate one of my friend's birthday. All 6 guests came on time but the birthday girl came pretty late lol.The waiter warned us that their kitchen is small so it's best if they had everyone's order soon while the birthday girl was running late. But we didn't have any issues since we knew what the bday girl wanted to order lol. 4 friends ordered the Tasty Crustacean, 1 ordered the Drunken Golden Bird, 1 ordered the Upstream Swimming Fish, and finally I ordered the Truffled Moneybag. 2 friends who ordered the Tasty Crustacean didn't enjoy their pasta, while the other 2 who ordered it said it tasted ok but had better lobster pasta elsewhere. For the Upstream Swimming Fish, the only flaw my friend said was the salmon was dry. My other friend who ordered the Drunken Golden Bird, said she liked the sauce but the chicken cutlet tasted like any standard cutlet. As for my dish, the portion of the Truffled Moneybag was pretty small with about 8-10 pieces of the beggar purse bag pasta. But the flavors were amazing! Although the white truffle sauce was super rich and creamy, it really paired well with the beggar purse pasta that was stuffed with ricotta cheese.",0
13256,"I recently visited this restaurant for their lunch tasting menu and overall found it to be a pleasurable experience. The menu offers a variety of dishes to sample, which is ideal for those keen to explore different flavors without spending too much. However, I did find the food leaned towards being somewhat overly salty for my taste and that of my guests. Service-wise, the staff was attentive and helpful, and the inclusion of gratuity in the bill was a thoughtful touch. While the restaurant provides a solid dining experience, it lacks that certain spark to elevate it to an exceptional level.",1
18936,"A very pleasant and surprising meal here! Came around 6 on a Friday night, there was a decent crowd but no wait. I was surprised at how big the space was, really liked the open kitchen as well. Decent happy hour deals as well that last until 7pm.We started with the meats and cheese platter for two, fried baby artichoke (both a part of happy hour menu) and burratta which was one of their specials of the night. The meats and cheese comes with 3 or 4 types of meat and 4 different cheeses, two servings of each. All our appetizers were good, definitely worth getting if you're there during happy hour. I got kale carbonara spaghetti which was another special they offered that night and my boyfriend got the pesto gnocchi. The carbonara was good, spaghetti cooked al dente, LOTS of pancetta. The kale which is grinder and mixed into the carbonara sauce made the pasta itself taste less heavy, really enjoyed this. Although I didn't feel like it had a heavy kale flavor, but definitely tasted like a good carbonara. The gnocchi was cooked pretty soft, and pesto was strong. String beans was a nice touch to it.Our food came out pretty quick, and the servers would take away our finished plates as soon as they noticed we were done. The waitress was also nice, came by a couple of time. Definitely give this place a try if you're around here and craving Italian.",0
10306,"While the quality at this establishment leaves something to be desired, the value and speed of service are noteworthy.

Perfect for a quick bite when hunger strikes after hours.",1
17385,"Came here and wait for about 20 minutes on a friday afternoon for a party of 3.The thing that surprised me the most was how small everything was. We spent about 36 bucks a person after ordering 3 dishes.The bonchon was good and they gave you some home made tofu curds. Honestly...didn't think it was that great and there wasn't any sauce to go with it. So just tasted a bit bland, and since it was curds I didn't think the texture was that great either. We go the grilled bokbunja which is a little sweet and the meat was perfectly cooked. The perilla leaves had way too strong of a taste and I would pass on this. Think tea + mint flavor, just overwhelming and very powerful.Next we had the spicy chicken. This was my favorite dish as the flavor was good and the chicken was extremely tender. Once again had the perilla leaves and that was just too much for me. They put some tteokbokki in it and I just love those.Lastly, we got the budae jeongol cause I love these pots. This one was just spicy and I don't think it had enough meat in it. There was hot dog, spam, some beef. I think the flavoring could be a bit better here. I think it was just a generic spicy korean flavor. The things it's also missing in all of these dishes is cheese!! Where the cheese at man???Overall, I feel like there are some dishes good, but just not worth the price.",0
2196,"Pretty sh1tty pizza and counter service that doesn't care. Only wanted some fresh dough, pepperoni and mushroom, but counter guy grabbed a bunch of both mush and pepperoni with bare hands and threw it on a slice that's been sitting there for hours and burnt it in the oven.  If you're at NYU, maybe you don't care. But for the education you're getting, you deserve better.",0
1689,Cute little diner in Times Square. My colleagues and I came here on our first night in New York for a conference.Service was good! No complaints there.My only major qualm here is that this place is definitely NOT vegetarian friendly. There were barely any options other than a veggie burger. The burger was good but I was surprised to see a menu with only actual vegetarian item on it! Seems strange for 2019 when there are so many of us out there! So yeah... I ordered the veggie burger LOL.One of my colleagues got a gigantic chicken pot pie it was hilarious!We were seated quickly which was great because I was worried since it was insanely busy. But they actually have an entire back area with lots of additional room for people.The bathrooms were dark and a little bit dirty. But I kind of expect it because it was only one tiny bathroom for the whole place - there are a lot of people going in and out of there!,0
13168,"Title: A Delightful Birthday Dinner at Creole Delights

I had the pleasure of celebrating my birthday with a party of seven at this gem of a restaurant, and what an experience it was - worthy of 4.5 stars! We arrived in time to take advantage of the happy hour menu, which boasted both food and drink specials until 8pm.

Our table shared an array of dishes - the creole poutine, Louisiana sticky wings, the mouthwatering shrimp po boy sliders, a rich cajun mac and cheese with shrimp, and the star of the night, the Brussels sprouts. Crispy to perfection, these sprouts were undoubtedly the highlight of our meal. 

As a birthday treat, the house gifted us two complimentary cornmeal waffle desserts with berries. A deliciously sweet touch to a savory feast!

The staff's friendliness and helpfulness shone throughout the evening, which added to the festive atmosphere. Service, however, was slower than ideal, the only factor keeping my rating from a full five stars.

A pro tip for potential visitors: make sure to check in on Yelp for a sweet 15% discount on your food and drink. Definitely a spot I'd recommend and revisit!",1
3446,"I used to come here in the mid to late 2000's with my family and I've always liked the place. Located across the street from the AMC Theater, this is THE spot to go with your group for an after movie bite to eat.  We came here after Avengers ENDGAME to unpack the film and discuss some pivotal scenes. Doing it over a thick juicy cheeseburger or fish and chips, or over a thick rootbeer float in a modern 50's style diner certainly adds to the experience. We all were seated in a booth tucked in a cozy corner and commented on how sequestered we felt so we could freely discuss the movie without spoiling it for anyone nearby. The prices are, in my opinion, reasonable, for NYC; the four of us amassing an $88 bill, an average of $22 pp.If you find yourself wanting a bite after an event at Madison Sq Garden (which is 1 block over), after a movie, after visiting the Manhattan Center next door, or having time to kill time before your AMTRAK arrives, walk over one block to Tick Tock and grab something to eat.",0

Walking past Shokudo, you might not give it a second glance, its humble exterior concealing the culinary delights that await within. This unassuming hole-in-the-wall is a beacon for those in search of a quick, satisfying bite in a neighborhood where the vibe often overshadows the food offerings.

Star of the show? The edamame. It's stellar, cooked to perfection, and is a must-try for anyone dropping in. Sushi lovers can expect serviceable rolls that hit the spot without quite soaring to the heights of excellence – but in the context of a speedy, casual meal, they are more than acceptable.

Shokudo is your best bet in the area for a swift, pleasant dining experience without the frills. On a bustling stretch of 9th Ave, this spot stands out for its simplicity and quality.

The price point is on the higher side, with salads in the $20-$25 range, but you're also paying for the chic ambiance. My coworker's salad came with shrimp, grilled to perfection. I've got my eye on their panini for a future visit. Pro tip: snag a reservation or arrive early to secure a spot. A solid 4-star lunch destination.",1

The soups here are exceptional, with the fish cake stew being a personal favorite. Not only is the stew deliciously umami-laden, but the skewered fish cakes are also a clever touch for easy eating. And for those looking to buffer the effects of a night out, the hearty Korean seafood pancake does not disappoint.

On the sweeter side, Pocha 32 excels with its deep-fried offerings. The standout has to be the fried chicken in sweet garlic sauce paired with French fries—a sublime fusion of flavors and textures that's hard to forget.

And let's not forget about the drinks—watermelon soju is a refreshing choice that perfectly complements the meal.

If you're in Brooklyn's Dumbo area, seeking a lunch that's both fabulous and wallet-friendly, look no further than this little gem of a cart. Operating from 10:30 am to 4:00 pm, it's astonishing how such a compact spot can deliver enough to satisfy the hungriest of patrons.

The generous portion could easily be mistaken for a feast, especially given the modest $8 price tag. The curry itself struck a delightful balance with its coconut-rich base, embracing perfectly blanched carrots and bok choy that retained just the right crunch.

In a neighborhood that's my daily haunt for work, discovering this cart is akin to striking culinary gold. It has promptly secured its spot as my everyday lunch destination – and for good reason.",1
11758,"Title: A Hidden Gem with Authentic Greek Flavors

My dining experience at this off-the-beaten-path restaurant was an unexpected delight. The authenticity of the Greek cuisine shone through with every bite, particularly with the chicken kebab and lamb chops I ordered. Both dishes were seasoned to perfection, the chicken tender and the lamb cooked just right.

The ambiance of the place struck a balance between casual and sophisticated, with a front room offering a more laid-back setting and another that hinted at formality. The decor cleverly blended bar, lounge, and restaurant vibes, creating an inviting atmosphere.

Service was top-notch; from the warm welcome by the host to the attentive waiter, the staff made us feel right at home. Capping off our dinner with complimentary pastries was a sweet touch that didn't go unnoticed.

In conclusion, if you're in the area and craving Greek fare, this spot is a must-visit for its delightful food, charming atmosphere, and amiable service.",1
118,"Title: Seoul Delights in the Heart of the City

I recently dined at this gem of a Korean restaurant which boasts not only delicious food at reasonable prices but also an enviably convenient location just a short walk from nearby subway stations. Despite the lack of an elevator, the upstairs entrance is easy to find and leads to a surprisingly calm and serene dining atmosphere, especially on a Monday afternoon.

The staff here are as friendly and attentive as they come – always on hand to answer questions and guide you through the menu, which is brimming with options. The cleanliness and casual vibe of the place enhance the dining experience.

Now, onto the fare: the kimchi is outstanding, a true highlight. The soondae (Korean sausage) was flavorful and the beef japchae (stir-fried glass noodles) nostalgic, reminiscent of a beloved homemade dish. Don't let the appearance of the seolleongtang (beef bone soup) deluxe deceive you; it may look bland, but the soup is rich and satisfying. For those desiring an extra kick, more sauce is available, but in my opinion, the flavors are spot-on as is.

In all, it's a dining experience that's undeniably worth the visit. I'll certainly be coming back for more of their comforting Korean classics.",1
19826,"Very cute spot that I want to love, but overall was a bit underwhelming. The place has a cool island concept, and the menu certainly reflects that, but the prices don't really match up to what you pay for, and service pretty inconsistent. The staff was all very nice but I think there was a large party in the back while we were there, and our server would disappear for long amounts of time, and we ended up ordering certain things with a different server. The calamari was fine, standard frozen situation. The mussels were a little bit under-seasoned, and the fries that were meant to go with them came out about 10 minutes later. The steak was good but again for the price I was expecting a little bit more. My favorite part of the meal was the ice cream sundae (but in all fairness it's hard to mess that up).Overall, would try this place again to hopefully get better results!",0
11245,"Title: Cozy Patio Dining with Tantalizing Flavors

My friend and I effortlessly booked a table on a weeknight at this charming restaurant, and were delighted to be seated in the comfort of their winter-ready covered patio. The evening kicked off on a high note with the Sage Advice cocktail, which was a flavorful beginning.

We shared an array of dishes, among which the tuna crudo was a standout – its freshness and execution were simply impeccable. The blue crab carbonara followed, presenting a pleasing texture with its crunchy topping, although it teetered on the edge of being overly salty. The branzino special carried the same minor flaw; while the fish was cooked to perfection, the side of polenta was a bit too robust on the salt for my taste.

Capping off the night, the cookie skillet dessert was an undeniable hit. It's a foolproof choice for anyone looking to end their meal with an indulgent treat.

In summary, the restaurant delivered a lovely dining experience with a few small missteps in seasoning. The warmth of the patio and the standout tuna dish ensured a memorable evening, making it a place I'd recommend with the caveat of watching the salt.",1
1324,"Title: A Feast for the Senses at Chef Einat's Culinary Haven

From the moment I attended a speaking event with Chef Einat, I knew I had to experience her culinary creations firsthand. Her restaurant did not disappoint, offering a true explosion of flavours that left me thoroughly impressed.

The concept of shared dishes adds a convivial twist to the dining experience, though individual indulgence is certainly welcomed. Our table's highlights included the Hummus Tahina — a tantalizing mix of creamy hummus and a zingy red s'chug, paired with warm, fluffy pita. The lightly fried and irresistibly crispy cauliflower, accompanied by the novel addition of pickled raisins, was a delightful surprise.

Equally noteworthy was the tender octopus with perfectly paired potatoes, and the melt-in-your-mouth skirt steak that rested atop a pile of heavenly crispy potatoes, showcasing a mastery of textures.

Capping off the meal, the Whipped Feta was a dreamy closer with its sweet and slightly crunchy pomegranate molasses and sunflower seeds, making for an indulgent dessert-like treat that had us scraping the bowl clean.

Prompt, efficient service ensured our dishes arrived swiftly, only adding to the stellar experience. Enthusiastically recommended for anyone seeking a memorable meal, this restaurant is a testament to Chef Einat's inspiring culinary vision.",1
18565,"This is such a cute and charming restaurant!! It's got such a cozy/relaxed vibe. I'm so glad I decided to try it out! I love that they only take limited reservations so most of their seats are reserved for walk-ins-- it means that if you stop by at 5 when they open, or like 5 min before, you're almost guaranteed to get a table. My waitress was super sweet, kept checking in on me to make sure I was alright and enjoying the food. Now onto the food-- I ordered the toro ssam bap, which is definitely pricey for an appetizer but absolutely worth it. It's just yumminess in each bite. I ordered the gochu ramyun for my main course, which absolutely hit the spot on a chilly autumn evening. Incredible depth of flavor, not too spicy, great noodle consistency, and pork belly was cooked perfectly. Definitely one of the best bowls of ramen I've had in my life. This place definitely deserves its Michelin star rating, it's comfort food at its finest.",0

So I looked through my UberEats app, and found Bareburger. I decided on something simple, and got their standard burger. I got grilled onions, cheese, ketchup, and mustard... nothing fancy. After waiting less than half an hour, I had my food in front of me, ready to eat.The burger was delicious! It was feeling, but did not leave me with a food coma. Unlike the burgers from Five Guys, this burger joint actually prepped my burger with a fine balance of ingredients. I'm impressed with the burgers here, and I hope they open up a location closer to school or home.",0

18695,"I recently ordered delivery from a spot I'd bookmarked for their New York-style pizza, and it didn't disappoint. Despite a longer wait time via GrubHub, the pizza was worth the anticipation. The crust struck that perfect NY chewiness, the tomato base was flavorful, and the cheese was balanced – present but not overwhelming. It was comforting to find out they deliver for those late nights when dining in isn't an option. I'm eager to visit the restaurant next time to experience their offerings firsthand.",1
16709,"The unique experience here is what sets this place apart. The omakase is really good but the meal goes by somewhat quickly. By necessity they need to finish each seating of four in under an hour. They only have four seats. I repeat. FOUR!They do have a mini living room area where you can chat and sip drinks. It seats about four. Then they have a patio balcony which they plan to open this spring/summer. That will definitely be worth visiting.Anyhow, I came here as part of a black elite event. Full disclosure. We had the 17 course omakase and everything was top quality. I was lucky to have a fun group. Shoutout to Michael C and Dave L! My favorite course was probably the fatty tuna. It was like butter and tuna made a baby. So delicious!This is a super unique concept and it takes speakeasy restaurants to another level. Worth a visit for the experience!",0

Dos Caminos is a restaurant with a bar--meaning it isn't open that late 10 on most nights and 11ish on Thursday and Friday. the full bar pours a few signature cocktails, but i would say that the focus is on its takes on Mexican dishes. some more traditional than others. that said, the menu is solidly good. PRO TIP: they have 9 pm to 10 pm happy hour on most nights which has a variety of drinks and bar menu items at discounted prices. and the other happy hour is great for day drinkers lol 3 pm - 6 pmget the LARGE guacamole. the guac is perfect. the chips feel fresher than a lot of other places. get the large guac  portion. it's served in a Mexican molcajete (stone bowl). It easily feeds 3 people who want to snack. the queso fundido: melted seasoned cheeses that you scoop up with small corn tortillas. yum. the quesadilla is pretty big and shareable. comes  with a small scoop guac.the more dinner-y menu have a nice variety of selection and shouldn't leave you hungry or disappointed in terms of quality. drinks? get the margaritas! service is fairly fast and pretty friendly. drops mic cuz I rock the GUACi outzzz",0

18864,"Title: A Seafood Gem in Manhattan - The Mermaid Inn

I always make a point to visit The Mermaid Inn whenever I'm in town, and it never disappoints. Tucked away in the heart of Manhattan, this seafood haven might not boast an endless variety of fish, but the carefully curated menu has something superb for every palate. Its excellence is evident in each dish, especially the oysters—so fresh, I'd happily devour three dozen!

The pricing is fair, which is a pleasant surprise for seafood of such high quality. Add to that a well-stocked bar with skillfully mixed drinks and a thoughtful wine selection, and it's clear why The Mermaid Inn is a local favorite.

Given its cozy size, snagging a reservation is a must, a testament to its popularity. During our last visit, it was bustling with happy diners while surrounding venues were noticeably quieter.

The Mermaid Inn promotes a warm, unpretentious atmosphere, complemented by attentive and personable service. Our server, a charming artist, even took the time to offer drawing tips to my enthusiastic nephew, a sweet touch that personalized our experience.

In sum, The Mermaid Inn is not to be missed. It's a place where food, atmosphere, and service converge to create a thoroughly delightful dining experience. Highly recommended for anyone looking to enjoy superb seafood in a friendly setting.",1
11851,"During my visit to Jane, a NYC brunch spot, the experience was underwhelming. I opted for their Eggs Benedict, which unfortunately did not impress.

With a myriad of exceptional brunch locales in the city, I would suggest exploring other options.",1

No one came by to check if everything's ok or if we needed anything, we had to flag waiters down. The pastas lack in flavor, the lemon chicken was okay, the giant appetizers were okay, and the mushroom stuffed meat was wayyyyyy too salty. I ordered decaf coffee toward the end of the dinner and waited about 20 minutes for the coffee to arrive. Pasta with clams- that was the highlight of the day. It was the best dish since there were actually flavors. Salmon- second best dish, even though it was hard and dry, it was better than all the other dishes. Strawberry short cake is actually whipped cream in between 3 slices of bread and a mountain high stash of whipped cream on top. Can you believe it? Very hard passes- pasta with tomato sauce, strawberry short cake, cheese cake, mushroom stuffed meat, and lasagna. Overall, I will not return back since both the food and the service was mehh.",0

You really fall in love the with the city. Everything was beautiful and elegant from the Le creuset salt and pepper shakers, down to the beautiful Perceval 9.47 knives.  We were greeted by our server as well as the head sommelier. We were presented with menus and a overwhelming wine book. The anchovies from Sicily, butter from Normandy and the chicken liver with everything bagel toppings were delicious and a nice touch. Lobster quenelle: Mushrooms & Roasted Lobster Emulsion. This was good. Creamy as expected. Foie gras Reuben: Tête de Veau, Dijon, Garlic Pickles & Brioche. This was my favorite. I absolutely love foie gras. Scotch snails: Pork Sausage, Parsley & Garlic Butter. This was also very good. **we ordered the three best for the 1st course. Striped bass: Creamed Spinach, White Asparagus & Trout Roe. I actually wasn't in the mood for fish but everyone seemed to like it. Wagyu coulotte: Spätzle, Black Trumpets & Beets. I usually don't like spatzle but it actually complemented the dish well, as did the beets and black trumpets. It was out of this world good. Crescent duck: Walnuts, Radish & Citrus. The citrus and radish with the duck, is just perfection. All of the flavors melt in your mouth. The duck was 10% fat and 90% meat cooked medium rare. I usually don't like medium rare but in this case the back of the house really knows what they're doing. Gatekeeper: (Sheep, Cow) Pickled Apples & Pretzel. If you're looking for something light, this is the way to go. Espresso cake: Vanilla Milk Ice & Cocoa Nibs. There were at least 2 different types of cakes. And a taste of really strong coffee/espresso. Obviously, don't get this if you don't like coffee. Hazelnut soufflé: Praline Whiskey Caramel. This was the best dessert at the table. Everyone agreed. Lastly, we were one of the last tables and we were presented with small cakes and truffles for our travels home. The plating, the views, the food, the staff, everything was fantastic.

When I walked in to use the restroom before we were seated, the other employee just stood against the wall without saying hello or a smile.  He just looked so unhappy being there.  Where do they get these people who work here?The food was fine. My partner ordered Duck Ssäm, which he loved.  I had the Brisket Okonomiyaki.  This dish was too strange. The brisket was very good, but not as part of Okonomiyaki. For me, service is so tied into my experience of a restaurant. There are so many other options. I would not come back.",0
14233,"Title: Great Location and Tasty Dishes at Local Indian Eatery

I recently dined at this conveniently located restaurant on a weekday and was immediately impressed by the extensive variety of dosa offered. Despite the temptation, I settled on my staple choice of palak paneer. The dish didn't disappoint; it was delightful with a creamy texture, and the paneer cubes were perfectly firm yet tender. However, I did find the portion size a bit modest given the price point.

The service added a unique touch to the evening. Our server's quirky personality provided entertainment that enhanced our dining experience, making it memorable and enjoyable.

Here's a quick breakdown of my ratings for the restaurant:
- Taste: 4/5

12305,"Title: A Quirky Spot with Comforting Chinese Fare

I recently dined at a restaurant that was a delightful study in contrasts. The front of the establishment exuded elegance, which led to a moment of disorientation as we made our way to a kitschy back-room bursting with pink pigs and humorous quotes that definitely tickled our funny bones.

Our large group was warmly welcomed by the owner, despite receiving less-than-stellar service from our impatient waitress. We kicked off the meal with an array of appetizers; the popcorn shrimp and juicy dim sum stole the spotlight.

The main courses included a variety of Chinese staples, from steamed fish to hot pot. The soft shell crab and steamed fish stood out as the star dishes, overshadowing the pork dishes surprisingly. 

While no single dish left me awestruck, the overall experience was one of contentment and comfort. Though I'm not inclined to go out of my way for a return visit, I'd suggest stopping by for their standout items if you find yourself in the vicinity with a craving for Chinese food served with a unique twist.",1

12508,"Title: A Delightful Evening at Boqueria

Review:

My dining companions and I had the pleasure of experiencing Boqueria restaurant, having successfully booked a same-day reservation for an early dinner. We were promptly seated by 5:30 PM, just ten minutes after our arrival.

The evening commenced on a high note with a pitcher of exquisite red sangria that set the tone for the culinary journey ahead. Opting for the Boqueria chef experience at $60 per person, we were not disappointed. The diverse offering of dishes was mouth-watering and the quality of the food was exceptional. From the savory tomato-infused bread to the perfectly charred shishito peppers, each dish was a hit.

The Ibérico ham melted on our tongues, while the skatewing paired with dill yogurt and pickled cauliflower was a testament to the kitchen's attention to detail. The paella and mushroom croquetas were standouts, encapsulating the essence of Spanish cuisine. To end the feast on a sweet note, the churros were simply divine. 

The service, led by servers Max and Marilyn, was flawless, and Simone, the ever-attentive manager, ensured our experience was nothing short of spectacular. With such commendable hospitality and delectable food, I wholeheartedly endorse Boqueria. It's advisable to book reservations online in advance—trust me, you'll be glad you did.",1

I recently visited this quaint brunch spot, charmed by its inviting patio — an ideal setting when the weather cooperates. The ambiance and service were both commendable; however, my culinary experience left something to be desired. While my friends' dishes, the Brussels sprouts and chicken sandwich, sparked food envy with their appetizing appearance and aroma, my Chicken and Waffles fell flat. The dish suffered from a lack of moisture and flavor, which was particularly disappointing given its generous portion size. I regretfully left half uneaten. A note for diners: the chicken is bone-in. Though the establishment exudes charm and the staff are attentive, I would recommend future patrons steer clear of the Chicken and Waffles.",1
15433,"Came back again at lunch time on a weekend, was pretty fast to get seated. Just some people need to share table, only have handful of table available.

20836,"Title: A Slice of Heaven at Artichoke Heaven

After much anticipation, I finally had the chance to visit the famed Artichoke Heaven and the experience did not disappoint. The highlight of my visit was, without a doubt, the artichoke slice. Priced at $6.00, the slice may seem steep for some, but the generous portion size coupled with its exceptional taste offers great value for money.

The artichoke slice is a culinary masterpiece — a harmonious blend of creaminess, cheesiness, and robust flavor that tantalizes the taste buds. It lived up to and surpassed every expectation, making it clear why the eatery has gained its notoriety.

A word to the wise: bring cash when you visit, as the location does not accept other forms of payment. Seating can be a challenge due to its limited availability, so prepare for a possible wait. However, any inconvenience fades in comparison to the gastronomical delight that awaits. This place is a must-visit for anyone with a penchant for pizza that's out of the ordinary.",1

I may have just found my new go-to lunch spot! The interior is spacious with plenty of tables, and the colored window panel design adds a unique touch.

Plus, the convenience of table service is a nice hybrid of dine-in and take-out.

The food impressed me – the salmon sandwich hit all the right notes for a pescatarian meal, and it came with outstanding fries and a salad. The salad's seasoning was so good I found myself alternating bites with the sandwich to enhance the flavor. If you want a delicious lunch and work nearby, I suggest calling your order in about 10 minutes before you arrive to save time. Definitely recommend it for the quality food!",1
2477,"Nestled in the bustling Financial District within Eataly, Osteria della Pace seemingly promises an upscale dining experience amidst the corporate hustle. Regrettably, the restaurant fails to justify its steep prices with the quality of its offerings. While there's no faulting the edibility of the Italian fare served, it lacks the uniqueness one would expect from a high-end eatery – feeling more akin to something your local neighborhood joint might serve up for less.

The calamari and zucchini, though generously portioned for sharing, were disappointingly bland and suffered from a heavily applied batter that refused to adhere. The promised spicy kick from the tomato sauce accompanying them turned out to be more of a timid nudge, reminiscent of standard canned marinara.

The Orata al Forno (sea bream) delivered on texture, with well-roasted meatiness, yet was marred by poorly removed bones and accompanying roasted potatoes that left a regrettable aftertaste. The saving graces of the plate – olives and roasted cherry tomatoes – couldn't salvage the dish entirely. Similarly, the broccoli rabe side dish remained unremarkable due to inadequate seasoning and its intrinsic bitterness.

A companion's scallops, albeit perfectly seared with a savory char, couldn't escape the shadow of their overinflated cost – $36 for just three pieces borders on the exorbitant.

In summary, Osteria della Pace offers a distinctly average culinary experience at prices that are difficult to swallow. For those seeking value and flavor that matches the cost, it may be wise to look elsewhere.",1
18552,"As a long-time patron of Jaiya Thai, my affection for this culinary gem has not waned despite my move from New York City. On a recent visit for my birthday weekend, I adhered to tradition, ordering my tried-and-true favorites, including the standout Chili Chicken and Jaiya Special Sauce with whole fish. The dish, accompanied by fried rice, never fails to impress with its balance of flavor and heat.

If time allows, the Volcanic Tom Yum and Coconut Tom Kha soups are essential experiences, offering a symphony of spicy and savory notes that dance on the palate. Not to be overlooked, the tempura eggplant appetizer is a testament to Jaiya Thai's mastery of spice.

Jaiya Thai has consistently delivered dishes that brim with an authentic, delicious heat I've yet to encounter elsewhere. This place is not just a restaurant to me; it's a treasured gastronomic retreat that resides in my top 5 list for life – a true testament to its enduring excellence.",1
10027,"Title: A Tale of Two Visits to ICHIRAN Ramen

My culinary journey at ICHIRAN, renowned for its delectable ramen, was a tale of two experiences. The first, a weekend endeavor in February 2019, entailed braving a snaking line at 6 pm, a testament to its popularity. In contrast, a weekday visit at 7 pm proved more tranquil with no wait time.

The food remained consistently high-quality across visits, mirroring the ICHIRAN flavors I first savored in Tokyo—with one puzzling exception. Despite the menu's promise of a soft boiled egg, the $2.90 addition was decidedly hard boiled, a peculiar adaptation for American palates that diverged from Japanese tradition.

As for value, a fully loaded bowl can climb to $24, placing ICHIRAN in the premium price bracket, even with a no-tip policy. It's clear that this isn't a daily indulgence but rather a sporadic treat for the taste buds.

Final Verdict: Indulge in ICHIRAN's ramen for a special occasion, but skip the egg—it's an overpriced letdown.",1

The fish tacos were decent but could've used more flavor or have the sauces on the side as an option. The machete quesadillas are basically braised pork with cheese and jalapeños which was flavorful and potentially spicy!Overall, it was decently priced, maybe a little on the pricey side, but worth the visit.",0
14114,"**Review of Barrio's Mexican Restaurant - NYC**

Last Saturday, my sorority sisters and I visited Barrio's for a reunion night craving Mexican cuisine. Here's the breakdown of our experience:

**Pros:**
- **Atmosphere:** Ideal for various outings including date nights and small family dinners.
- **Service:** Staff were friendly, efficient, and professional.
- **Seating:** Comfortable dining experience without the discomfort of being too exposed to passersby.
- **Drinks:** The watermelon and hibiscus margaritas were notable—pricey yet tasty.

**Cons:**
- **Space:** The restaurant is on the cramped side, and the proximity to the entrance and restroom caused some discomfort due to foot traffic.
- **Chips and Guac Overcharge:** We were over-served and overcharged with two sets of chips and guac that we didn't request, totaling $28.
- **Food Quality:** The Al Pastor Tacos were disappointingly dry. The Chicken Enchiladas were tainted by the presence of hair.
- **Seating Arrangement:** Tables are too small for a group of three, causing a cluttered dining experience.
- **Pacing:** We felt rushed to leave, receiving the bill promptly after finishing our meal without being asked if we wanted anything else.

**Conclusion:** Despite the great vibes and service, the letdowns in food quality and space management overshadowed the positives. While I was eager to enjoy Barrio's based on glowing reviews, the reality fell short. Reluctantly, I am unsure about returning.",1

10660,"Title: A Milestone Review on Roosevelt Island - Decent Fare and Friendly Service

For my 200th Yelp review – a momentous occasion I jokingly hope might turn into a job offer – I wish the spotlight were on a more distinguished venue. Roosevelt Island dining options are few and far between, echoing the need for culinary expansion. Amidst these limited choices, we patronized this local eatery due to its proximity to an event we were attending at Cornell Tech.

The honey chicken hero I ordered was surprisingly good, though I wouldn't have minded a bit more chicken in the mix. The generous helpings of lettuce and tomato, along with a subtle touch of honey mustard, were appreciated. My wife opted for the avocado salad, enhanced with chicken for an additional $2. She found it to be somewhat lackluster, noting that the chicken was slightly dry.

Overall, this place holds its own against the sparse competition in the area. What stands out are the pleasant staff and the cleanliness of the facilities, making for a fairly decent dining experience on Roosevelt Island.",1
13234,"I recently dined at Sahib with friends and was impressed by the experience. Nestled among a bevy of Indian eateries, Sahib sets a unique mood with its dim, candlelit ambiance reminiscent of a romantic scene. Our meal commenced with a complimentary shot of warm, sweet lentil drink, a delightful amuse-bouche.

Our order included an array of dishes: garlic naan, roti, a chicken curry with a vibrant orange sauce, a similar sauce accompanying a paneer curry, and a notably flavorful eggplant dish. Each was rich in taste and of high quality.

The service was seamless, leaving no room for criticism. Sahib has certainly earned my endorsement, and I anticipate my return.",1
3462,"We happen to run into this bar as we were trying to scape the crowds of the pride parade it was hot out & we wanted drinks. The place was jammed pack but still had some wiggle room to move about we stayed at the bar below, drinks had some Summer ale beer nice & cold ... after a few of these we needed something to pick on & got an order of the Mozzarella sticks not sure how nice I was but these were great!! Big mozz sticks were good nice & cheesy, great when dipped in the sauce totally hit the spot.The bar itself is pretty big with 2 levels each was as crowded as the next. The place was pretty busy but service was good considering how busy & crowded it was, prices are not bad. Good music playing, we enjoyed our time here the vibe was fun.",0
16798,"I found this restaurant while looking for vegan NYC restaurants on Yelp and decided to visit on a Sunday evening. The restaurant is beautiful and has a relaxing ambiance, so it is the perfect place for a date or intimate gathering. I was in a party of two (including myself) so I did not find it necessary to make a reservation, but as there is a lower and upper level for seating, we were immediately seated regardless. I ordered the orzo alfredo with chicken (extra cost) and my friend ordered crispy artichokes and buffalo maitake wings; the food came out fairly quickly. The reason for my three-star rating is because the quality of food that I received did not match up with the price. I felt as though my plate of the orzo alfredo and chicken looked like one of those plastic replicas of food that children play with. Furthermore, it didn't taste great either. For $27, I expected to be blown away, but the more I ate, the more disappointed I became. The dish lacked in flavor and the textures were off. I tried the crispy artichokes and they were also lacking in that wow factor, surely not worth $14. I didn't get to try the buffalo maitake wings, but my friend said that she enjoyed them. According to her, they were better than the orzo alfredo and crispy artichokes combined, so for those who plan on visiting (although I recommend against it) I would go with the wings to be safe.Overall, I would not return to this restaurant, let alone recommend it to others. The food was simply not up to par. It's almost as if you're paying for the ambiance.",0
11433,"Let me start by saying...I lovedddddd this place. Okay, now that you know where this review is going, let's get to reviewing, lol. Two old coworkers and I get together every few months to catch up and we love wine so typically we choose a place with a great wine selection, perfect choice. We had three starters for the table, meatballs, and two of the Bruschettas: mussels and the truffles honey. Both were super delish but the mussels one was my absolute fave. We also ordered three main dishes to share amongst the table so that we each get a chance to experience more of the menu. The food was absolutely amazing. I didn't get a slice of the Margherita pizza but I did experience both pastas we had, the pesto and the bucatini. Our waitress was super attentive at all times. The place was fairly empty when we got there and was all filled up by the time we left. If I had to duck any points it would be for the busboys. I know they're trying to be helpful and get items out your way as much as possible but they were being too hasty. Touching utensils before someone says they're done is a no no!! 10/10 would recommend this place especially considering the prices are super reasonable!!",0
11613,"A other new all-day restaurant, this one inside the new Sister City Hotel.We tried a few toasts and salads, and mostly everything was excellent. Try the Little Gem Salad ($16), definitely the prettiest one I've seen. The chicken sandwich was also solid. The one major misstep was the Jerusalem Bagel ($12), which came with some really delicious pistachio shallot labne, but the bread itself was super hard and not really what you would expect.The space is beautiful, as is the outdoor area which will open soon, so I'll definitely be back to try more soon.",0
13975,"Title: A Plea for Service Overhaul at Jose Andrés' Eatery

I regret to report that my recent experience at a Jose Andrés establishment was marred by service issues that I feel compelled to share. Candidly, the staff's efficiency was lacking, as they appeared disorganized and disinterested—a stark contrast to the vibrant spirit one expects at such a venue.

During a Friday visit to The Diner, the absence of draft beer due to barrel issues was disappointing. A previous attempt to dine here also resulted in frustration, with over ten minutes of being overlooked by a barman and eventually leaving without service.

At the Pasteleria, receiving my order felt like an afterthought as the attendant began taking new orders without completing mine, leaving me confused and unattended while other employees seemed idle.

My experience with the Bread and Empanada station was equally exasperating. A simple bread purchase turned into a 10-minute wait due to a lack of wrapping paper and an unnecessary gift-wrapping process that should have been a quick handover.

These service shortcomings are a recurring theme, not limited to one visit. Even though the food, such as the palmera de chocolate, remains delectable, and I've enjoyed items from various stations, the slow and seemingly apathetic service overshadows the culinary delights.

Moreover, purchasing options like a $17 paella served in a paper plate undermine the value and elevate the feeling of inconvenience as one scrounges for seating in a beautifully decorated space that hints at Mediterranean charm.

Despite the exceptional food, the service lapses at Jose Andrés' eatery are a dire warning. I implore the management to address these grievances before it's too late for customers like me, who despite working upstairs, find the service woes too great to justify the expense and effort required to dine here.",1
21038,"Title: A Filling but Average Asian Fare from A1

During a recent study session, I succumbed to a craving for chicken teriyaki and decided to order from A1 through UberEats. The delivery was timely, which was appreciated amid my intense focus on books.

Upon delving into the meal, I immediately found the chicken somewhat lacking in flavor - a touch on the bland side despite being overly salted. While the portion size was generous, overshadowing the standard servings from other establishments, the quality didn't quite hit the mark I was hoping for.

The accompaniments, rice and miso soup, met my expectations but did little to elevate the overall dining experience. A1 seems to cater to those in need of a quick Asian food fix rather than culinary connoisseurs seeking an authentic and high-quality meal. It's a decent option when convenience is key, but gastronomes might want to continue their search for a more refined taste of Asia.",1
2898,"I recently dined at a restaurant that impressed me with its delightful ambience and seamless reservation process. Although the portions could be more generous considering the price, the culinary experience was on point. The standout dishes included succulent meatballs, savory chicken empanadas, and a divine chocolate tres leches dessert. To complement the meal, I highly recommend the sweet and refreshing lychee Bellini.",1
17843,"Love this place! My friend and I stopped by for some appetizers midday and it was exactly what we were looking for. The prices were reasonable and the food was delicious. It is a cute place with more hole in the wall vibes tucked away near time square but far enough away from the madness that it's not annoying to go there.  We ordered three or four dishes and with the exception of one of them, the rest were delicious. They have these fried octopus balls that were to die for. They melted in your mouth when you ate them and the sauce on them was the perfect amount of flavor. The dish that we got that I did not like as much was not because it was done poorly, but because it was just a texture and flavor that I was not a fan of. The name of the dish is escaping me, but the dish was done well it just didn't fit with my flavor pallet. I will be back here! Especially because I really want to try their veggie ramen.",0
1,"When I went with my mom, there was a line. It was a 15-30 minute wait. Inside of Yin Ji Chang Fen Rice Roll is really clean and cute. The way it is designed reminds me of cafes and restaurants in Hong Kong. The door was kept open since it was a nice day, but they have a button for people to press to open and close the door if needed. They have a lot of rice roll options that aren't offered in many stores, so if you're interested in trying different rice rolls, this is the place to go.We ordered the pork liver and chives rice roll, minced beef congee (tang jai jook), Hong Kong style frozen milk tea, and the fried dough sticks. The congee takes 15 minutes to make so keep that in mind when you order. Our dough sticks came first and then the milk tea came. We left the dough sticks on the table because we were waiting for the congee. I'm not a fan of the frozen milk tea style because the milk tea is never cold enough and this was the case for the frozen milk tea here. Although I understand why this is a popular option because people believe that they are getting more of the actual drink instead of the milk tea being diluted with ice, I feel like the Hong Kong milk tea would definitely be better if it had ice. The milk tea was a little rough and it was lukewarm bordering cool. To Yin Ji Chang Fen's credit though, their milk tea has the strong color that Hong Kong milk tea has. I'd probably order the hot milk tea next time though.Congee arrived and then the rice roll came. The congee is really smooth. I was surprised to find fish and squid in the minced beef congee because I had never had tang jai jook with fish and squid before. Usually, it's just slices of beef or minced beef. To my surprise, there was little to no beef, but I wasn't upset. I highly recommend getting the congee if you're with a group of people because you can order the dough sticks or the sweet cruller to dip into the congee. The congee remained warm/hot even when we didn't touch it for a short while. The pork liver and chives rice roll was like 75% filling and 25% rice roll skin. It was good, but some of the pork liver has that distinct innards taste that some people may not like, so be warned. I really liked how they added regular chives and yellow chives to the rice roll because the yellow chives added an extra freshness to the dish. The rice rolls are on the pricier side, but they're big.There was honestly so much food that I wanted to try, but there's not enough room in my stomach for them, so I'll definitely be back to try some other items.",0
17785,"Fantastic service with a semi private seating on the 2nd floor of the ever so popular Totto (first floor). He had the deluxe and I opted for the chef's recommended black garlic one. Both very delish and generous but his was a notch above. Not just making up bang for buck- the deluxe actually comes with more amenities and cod-roe! More importantly, it was tastier. For the depth of broth and pork bone butter finish- his deluxe just nabbed the finish by a landslide. No knock on the seriously tasty and full black garlic oil that definitely made its presence known in my soup- it was very good. His was just better. My favorite part? Choosing the design of the noodle: extra firm, wavy. Yes. This feature needs to be a requisite at every Ramen joint.",0
13314,"I loved the Margherita pizza because it was simple and full flavoured. In fact, pizza is plentiful in New York City but I cannot stress the importance of the crust that delivers a moist full flavoured tomato sauce. I was actually interested in the photos on the wall, and decided that I might as well go for a timeless classic. I felt if this pizza can pack a decent sauce I will go back! That's how I really feel about second dates. You need to make a good first impression! (3.9) Oct 16th, 2019 visit.",0

10527,"83 1/2 is one of my favorite restaurants in the city and definitely my favorite spot on the UES. The paccheri alla vodka is phenomenal and one of my favorite pasta dishes ever.  I also love the veal parm. I don't normally like veal, but I dream about this dish. For appetizers, I'd highly recommend the eggplant parm - it melts in your mouth. The restaurant is relatively small, so I'd recommend making a reservation.  Don't skip this place.",0
1557,"There is a special meaning for my husband and I, which was the place of our first date, seeing Christmas Lights at Dyker Heights every year. The light is amazingly brilliant and romantic with holiday season atmosphere. It was worth a visit for couples and families. However, the traffic was extremely bad and there would be some street closures, especially for popular houses. Our recommendation is trying to park blocks away and walk into the popular area.",0
1138,"Rustic/industrial restaurant in West Village that can probably host 40-50 people. There's bar seating and great happy hour deals ($8 a cocktail). Wooden decor, plants, and dimly lit. Wonderful for a quiet evening meal but the theme can easily translate to brunch. The restaurant has seasonal menus and works with farms to curate game and other ingredients. We had the:  Bittersweet Happiness Salad: Goat cheese, mango, cucumbers - the perfect summer salad. It also wasn't drenched in your typical dressing which made it freshing and a light start to the meal. Brussel Sprouts: I'm normally so not a fan of brussel sprouts. However, this place cooked it so well! The bacon, cheese and oil gave it great flavor and masked the bitterness so that you only got a slight aftertaste. Octopus with scallops: Hot and cold. The octopus was grilled so nicely - crispy on the outside and not super chewy. The chickpeas underneath were great. The cold scallops were a great contrast in temperature and texture. Quail: It was my first time trying quail. It was seasoned very well and served over a vegetable medley. Duck: Favorite dish of the night. A crispy parmesan crust and a thick cut of duck that wasn't over cooked. It was over a bed of rice with a grapefruit sauce. The only downside was that the grapefruit sauce was too sweet for me and I wish it had more of that sour flavor.The presentation of the dishes overall was beautiful. Each dish was uniquely crafted and had so many flavors. Prices are on the higher side but fair for the food and presentation you're getting.",0
19932,"Visited a local gastropub recently, which offered a commendable variety of craft beers. If you find yourself around the area, it's a decent choice for a laid-back drink.

It's a solid, if not remarkable, option.",1
13728,"Title: A Hidden Gem for Takeout in Murray Hill – Montagu's Gusto

In the heart of NYC's Murray Hill, Montagu's Gusto has become my go-to spot, especially during the lock-down phase of the pandemic. It's high time I celebrated this place with a well-deserved five-star review.

Amidst the hustle, Montagu's Gusto stands out as an excellent lunch destination, offering quick service, sizable portions, and pricing that won't break the bank. The menu, with a focus on sandwiches and salads, delivers on both taste and quality.

The standouts for me have to be the Pancho Villa and Viva La Gusto sandwiches. Each bite is elevated by their addictive chipotle sauce—a real treat for the taste buds. Plus, knowing that sandwiches are hugged by bread from renowned bakeries like Balthazar and Sullivan Street Bakery really speaks volumes about the food quality here.

Don't skip their salads either; they are enormous and make for a nutritious choice without skimping on flavor.

Overall, Montagu's Gusto is a must-visit for anyone looking for fresh, wholesome, and downright delicious food that you can enjoy on the go.",1
16796,"Flashback Friday to my atypical experience at Melt Shop when they ran out of gluten free bread and dashed down to Fairway for a new bag of bread. They ended up giving me a double portion and a gift card towards a future purchase for the long wait. I ordered the Fried Chicken Melt (any fried chicken sandwich can be subbed with grilled chicken without an extra charge), which includes red cabbage, pepper jack cheese with melt sauce. *I let them know it's not a preference & that I am celiac. That being said even though I didn't have an issue always make sure they are following the proper procedure. Sometimes I forget the speech scroll of cross contamination.*",0
3181,"Title: Authentic Italian Gem in the Heart of the City

If you're searching for a taste of Italy in the city, look no further than this local Italian favorite. The cuisine is nothing short of delightful, delivering on the promise of authentic flavors. The only drawback is the rather tight seating arrangement typical of NY eateries, which can detract from the overall comfort. While the dessert left something to be desired, the rest of the meal was thoroughly enjoyable. Special mention must be made of their arancini – quite possibly the best you'll find in the city. A must-visit for anyone craving genuine Italian fare.",1
3331,"Title: A Slice Worth the Wait at Joe's Pizza

Joe's Pizza is a testament to the adage that the best things in life are worth waiting for. Despite the seemingly endless queues that line up in front of the establishment, I can't help but be impressed by how quickly things move. The efficiency of the staff is remarkable, ensuring that every customer is served with speed.

The slices served here are nothing short of gargantuan, perfect for those with a hearty appetite or a love for leftovers. Among the variety on offer, the mushroom and olive pizza stands out as a personal favorite. Joe's Pizza has nailed the art of balancing flavors, with the earthy mushrooms and briny olives coming together on a delicious canvas of cheese and sauce.

For anyone who finds themselves in the neighborhood, Joe's Pizza is an absolute must-try. Don't let the line deter you; it's a clear sign of the delicious experience that awaits.",1
11326,"Tucked away beside the bustling Jing Fong, Oriental Garden offers a serene mid-sized alternative for dim sum aficionados. Perfect for those looking to escape the usual crowds—especially families with impatient little ones—this hidden gem might charge a slight premium, but the trade-off is immediate seating and prompt service. Reserve a table for larger gatherings to ensure a seamless experience.

Their yearly Lunar New Year celebration finds us indulging in a whimsical array of dishes, from adorable chick-shaped glutinous rice dumplings (Hom Sui Gok) to the savory classics like har gow, pork sui mai, and steamed pork ribs. The wait staff, bearing their delights on trays and carts, provide an uninterrupted flow of treats right to your table.

Don’t skip on the desserts—their egg tarts and coconut pudding are the perfect sweet endnotes to the feast. While the restaurant maintains clean restrooms with two stalls for women and one for men, it's the food that will have you planning your next visit. For a taste of tradition with a touch of comfort, Oriental Garden is a must-visit for dim sum lovers.",1

On my infrequent visits to this little gem of a restaurant, the lobster in black bean sauce is the dish I daydream about. Today's meal hit the spot on an especially frigid, snowy day, with the Hot and Sour soup performing culinary magic, warming me from the inside out. A word to the wise: this charming spot operates on a cash-only basis, so come prepared to pay with greenbacks. Despite the minor inconvenience of no credit card transactions, the food is well worth the forethought.",1
1235,"Set in a prime spot in midtown, this restaurant offers a fantastic vibe and a welcoming atmosphere for diners looking for a pleasant evening out. My dining experience included an array of dishes, from sashimi and sushi to salad and steak. While the quality of the raw dishes was decent, they didn't quite dazzle the palate. The steak, similarly, was satisfactory but not memorable. It seems that part of what you're paying for here is the location itself. The drinks, much like the food, were serviceable but lacked that special touch to elevate them above the ordinary. In summary, if you're after a restaurant with a great ambiance in midtown, this could certainly fit the bill, but for those seeking a culinary adventure, it might not hit the mark.",1

12651,"I came here on a Friday evening with a group of 4 and even though it was pretty full, we were able to be seated right away.I had the Tom yum soup ($4.95), the lemongrass pork skewer (free with yelp check in), and the red curry with pork ($11.95). I also had a Thai iced tea.I think overall I was very pleased. The highlight for me was the pork skewer. It was flavorful, rich, and filling! The Tom yum soup, Thai iced tea, and red curry tasted authentic and had the right flavor combinations. The Tom yum soup was light in terms of the clear soup but still slightly spicy, slightly sweet and slightly sour or had the right hint of lime. The Thai iced tea was creamy and sweet. The red curry was spicy, the curry was thick, and it also has a tiny hint of sweetness. It was a generous portion too. The only slight negative was it was quite loud in the restaurant but that can be expected on a Friday night! The service overall was very good- waitress was prompt and attentive.",0

Opting for the Manhattan Bridge for 3, the platter included a generous assortment of 12 pieces of sushi, 3 rolls, and 15 pieces of sashimi, accompanied by 3 cozy cups of miso soup. The yellowtail sashimi stood out, surpassing my expectations with its freshness and flavor. I chose to customize my order by swapping the California roll for a yellowtail scallion roll, a small upcharge I found worthwhile. The rolls were well-crafted, maintaining their integrity without falling apart, and the rice was wrapped expertly. Overall, the sushi here definitely hit the spot and I look forward to my next meal.",1
1898,"I have friends that work nearby and come to Flats Fix often for lunch or happy hour ($6 beer shot combos!!!) I've come a few times to meet up with them and finally tried their tacos after hearing nothing but good things about them. If you order 3 tacos, you get a side of rice and beans. The rice and beans were well-seasoned and my friend who's from the Caribbean raved about how they tasted just like how her family would make them. For the tacos, I got 2 chicken and 1 carnitas. The chicken was good, I enjoyed the crema and cojita cheese guac. What blew me away after my first bite was the carnitas. The mango glaze added a nice touch of sweetness and the crispy camotes (sweet potato) on top gave a good unexpected crunch with each bite. I don't know why I've never ordered their food when I've been in for drinks many times, but I definitely will now. I've heard that the brisket tacos are unreal and can't wait to try it.",0

The French toast had babka in it at they were so so so delicious . The French toast is definitely five star worthy on its own! Both were divine but at least for the chilaquiles, they were not authentic. Portions were pretty big and definitely very filling. I realize that the cost is standard for New York so I can't really complain but it was a little pricey compared to California lolService was a little slow even though it wasn't very crowded.

The meal started with steamed eggs prepared in front of us, a classic Asian comfort food. As for the entrees, the coq au vin jjim-dak (chicken) was the best in my opinion. The meat was so tender, and it came with a generous portion of glass noodles. The butternut squash puree that came with the beef short ribs was amazing, and I found myself mixing it with the rice just to get more. All entrees came with 3 kinds of amuse-bouche, which were all unique (mung bean jelly, eggplant, and more). Our server, Andrew, was so happy and friendly and gave us detailed explanations of everything as well.",0

Lots of rice, which I do love but also tons of toppings! For protein I chose salmon and spicy tuna. Love the seaweed, corn, edamame.. all the crunchy stuff.. the wonton strips did get soggy but that's on me. Pretty tasty, and I'm sure it would've been even better if I had eaten it as soon as I picked it up... Would definitely come back.",0
17798,"4.5 stars. Maybe even 4.75. A few minor issues but most everything else was excellent. One of my more interesting, out-of-the-box (for me) dining experiences of late. I can't say I've tried Indonesian food and I certainly hadn't tried Indonesian-French fusion prior to visiting Wayan, so I was sidling through uncharted territory here. I tend to stick to Mediterranean, Spanish and Upscale American restaurants but this menu looked too good to pass up. And I was right (thanks, me--also, thanks Pete Wells for confirming my suspicions). Wayan is a delightful spot in a happening area, and I think it has serious staying power. A warm, playful space with an exciting menu that delivers unique, virtually flawless preparations. The cuisine here, quite literally, is a marriage. The well-known French flair of the Vongerichten clan mixed with Indonesian influence, a nod to Chef Vongerichten's wife's heritage. A harmonious union at that. Going out of your comfort zone here pays dividends. Share everything, regret nothing.Came here at 9pm on a Saturday night. A little late for us, but getting a table here these days is no easy feat. We were seated at the chef's counter so missed the complete dining room experience, but it was still plenty fun to witness the beautiful choreography taking place inside the kitchen. Weak points involved the service and beverages. The pace of everything was great, but our waiter himself rubbed us the wrong way. At one point he came over to ask how our drinks were and stopped his inquiry mid-sentence to note ""oh wow, you're almost finished"" in a tone dripping with judgment. He made a lot of other strange comments throughout the evening that were out of place/inappropriate, so it was a smidge uncomfortable. Why did I drink my first beverage so quickly, you may ask? Some of the smallest cocktails I've ever seen. I've seen cocktails served in myriad ways, and this was laughable. Tiny glasses filled almost exclusively with ice. We had to order three cocktails here just to feel a hint of a buzz. Sure, small glasses are apropos when you order a stirred beverage constructed over a block of ice, but these weren't that. All light, shaken drinks. And all $14 at that! See below: Peach Smash (irish whiskey, peach, shiso, crystalized wasabi)Instant Zen (rye, absinthe, chili, honey, citrus, angostura bitters)Yuzu Fizz (gin, yuzu, chickpea water, thai basil)Adu! (Cava, Campari, Kalamansi)All delicious with excellent flavors, but the first two were noticeably watered down upon arrival, so the profiles seemed muted. The Instant Zen and Yuzu Fizz were my favorites, though the crystalized wasabi of the Peach Smash was a thing of beauty.The food is the star at Wayan. It's hard to know what exactly to expect from French-Indonesian fusion. And even now that I've experienced it, I can't give you much more insight other than saying when it's done right, your taste buds will wake up in truly novel ways. The analogies coming to mind all involve music and dance, because the experience felt orchestral and immersive in nature. The creativity, complexity, technique and execution were all expert and dynamic. We were often surprised and always impressed. They recommend ordering everything to share, and plates come out as they're ready. Eats, below:Heart of Palm w/ mango, passion fruit, cilantro: AFresh and vibrant, seemingly ignored by servers and diners alike but not to be scoffed at. We wanted to a have some veggies with our meal so this seemed like a good choice. Gorgeous presentation, light but still super flavorful. Complete with edible flowers!Chicken Skewer w/ peanut sauce, kaffir: A+Much has been said about the skewers here, for good reason. This plate is a must-order. The chicken is seasoned perfectly and the peanut sauce slathered on top--though perhaps heavy-handed--is just stupid delicious. Avocado Gado Gado w/ quail egg, cucumber, peanut relish: A+The bf was lukewarm on this one but I thought it was brilliant. A wonderful array of textures and flavors, each ingredient serving a clear purpose in lending itself to the overall profile of the dish, even down to the bean sprouts. Heavier than your typical veggie dish but still on the lighter side relative to the rest of the menu. Clams Jimbaran Style w/ sweet onion, coconut: A+Sweet, spicy, tangy, eclectic, obviously delicious. The famous Pete Wells clams (the servers here have no qualms about name-dropping), and they delivered. The most unique dish of the night, somehow light and elegant yet outspoken and powerful. There's a lot going on, but nothing is out of place.Akuna Cod Bilingdingo w/ asparagus & fiddle heads, bilindango: ABeautifully cooked fish and more excellent flavors. Our waiter said that this was the spiciest dish on the menu, but neither of us found that to be the case (the bf thought the clams were spicier). This is light but still packs a punch. Loved the fiddle heads--these are becoming my new favorite accompaniment.",0
18447,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this place, given that they charge about twice the price or other steamed rice roll places in flushing and sunset park.  But I left extremely impressed.  Generous portion, a lot of nice sized shrimp extremely fresh rice roll, pleasant service, and nice atmosphere.  Overall worth it, and delicious.  I'd recommend to anyone.",0

12584,"I recently visited a local dining spot at the suggestion of a friend, and I must admit, the experience left something to be desired. While the ambiance of the restaurant impressed with its strikingly beautiful interior, the culinary offerings did not match the high expectations set by the decor. The menu, while promising on paper, resulted in dishes that were frankly forgettable, failing to leave a lasting impact on our taste buds—especially considering the steep prices. It appears that this establishment prioritizes aesthetic appeal over the flavor and innovation of its cuisine.",1
19967,"I am surprised I loved this place so much!  I wasn't too sure I would.  I was actually thinking I would dislike place because on the surface, it looks like a gimmicky Asian style chipotle lunch spot.  I can tell you after eating here, this place is far from that.  I got the salmon and it was really good!  They let you sample the curry so that was great.  It's perfect for someone that is weary of curry.  I like the assembly line where you pick your rice, protein, curry and then sides.  I like the freedom to pick and see what I am getting.The best part is that the people that work here are Thai.  Huge plus because authenticity means a lot to me.  I also love the fact that you can earn points via the clover app.  If you are in the area, this is a great lunch spot.  It's a bit expensive so it won't be a regular for me.  The food is great and on point.",0
17339,"Following a Sunday Ranger game, I met up with friends at this local gem that's clearly a hit with the post-game crowd. We delved into a smorgasbord of appetizers, shared a couple of delectable entrees, and ended on a sweet note with two desserts. Though the bill leaned towards the pricier side, it was justifiable by the extensive selection of beers and the warm, inviting ambiance that wrapped around us like a cozy blanket. Perfect for unwinding and recapping the game's highlights.",1
18645,Came into the City and first stop was this place the Grand Central Oyster Bar. My colleague has gone on about this place forever it really made an impression on her. So once we arrive at Grand Central we follow the signs to here. Very busy at lunchtime on a Friday afternoon we were immediately seated and asked what we would like to drink. The oysters we had were by region and had about nine different ones. The server explained to us when he brought them on a round tray on ice. In a circular motion he explained all the differences as well as the many condiments. For me it would mask the flavor so fresh lemon only. Amazingly it was the perfect amount of food for two. Also I wanted to be able to eat dinner later and not be too full. I was surprised by the reviews as I felt the service and food were great. Perhaps I am jaded as I live in South Florida where substandard service is the norm. Definitely would come back here again.,0
20864,"I recently had brunch with a friend at the new Lower East Side branch of a popular Queens eatery, excited to see what all the buzz was about. The seating was conveniently flexible, a plus given that we hadn't made a reservation. I opted for the small beef pho with added bok choy and mushrooms, totaling $14, and a Thai Iced Tea for $3.50. Unfortunately, the pho didn't live up to my expectations, especially when compared to the offerings at Madame Vo, which I find superior. While the experience was a letdown, at least now I know my preferences and likely won't be returning.",1
10737,"During a bustling Friday night outing with the family at Chelsea Market, we decided to give the highly praised taco spot a try. The customer service was the highlight of our experience. Despite the crowd, the staff managed the line with remarkable efficiency and friendliness, ensuring we received our order swiftly.

We settled on an assortment of tacos – adobada, carne asada, and chicken. Unfortunately, the adobada, even after removing the pineapple, proved too sweet for our taste, leaving my son and husband less than satisfied. However, the chicken tacos were a hit, truly deserving of their exclamation points, and while the steak tacos were satisfactory, they didn't wow us.

Moving on to the beverages, we sampled tamarindo, horchata, and Jamaica. Though I appreciated the light sugar touch, it seemed to compromise the depth of flavor, making them somewhat underwhelming. We finished our drinks, but wouldn't opt for them again.

In summary, while some offerings were a miss, I'd still recommend this taco haven for the standout chicken tacos and superb service, but a clearer menu would enhance the dining experience.",1
19421,"I absolutely love this place for when the Italian food cravings hit! The pizza here is consistently fantastic, always arriving fresh and bursting with flavor. It's become my go-to spot for a delicious Italian feast.",1
17239,"After watching the folded cheeseburger featured on First We Feast and again on one of Mikey Chen's personal food vlogs, I was sold. I had to go try this unique burger.I went to Miznon on a Friday night (after downing a couple of tacos from Los Tacos: yelp.com/biz/los-tacos-n… ) and I was surprised to find a DJ bumpin at this brightly-lit counter-service restaurant lol. Casual yet vibey, def matching the Chelsea Market aesthetics.My boyfriend ordered 2 folded cheeseburgers ($12.75/each + tax) for us, though we really could've just shared one since the other half of our stomachs that night were reserved for Los Tacos. Not long after we sat down, they arrived with a giant green pepper on the side. The slabs of meat were HUGE - only half of the patty was inside the pita bread itself, while the top half was bare, leaning over. It was good, I was impressed by the crunch of the cheese / crust of the meat, but the meat was definitely a lil heavy on the salt & pepper. If I were to better this experience, I would cut off the top half of the patty & try to squeeze it inside the bread (double patty!), or ask for a whole other pita to pocket that top half and split it with my boyfriend.Overall I think it's something worth trying at least once. Maybe not if you're a burger purist, but that crunch. and that pita... so interesting and unique.I almost burned my mouth/throat when I got to the top part of that delicious pepper so please be careful!",0
18997,"The atmosphere was what you'd expect for NYC in the theater district and the food was just ok for the price. It's a bit loud during peak dinner hours even on a weeknight and it was slightly difficult to hold a conversation without raising my voice above how I normally speak. Now for the food, I tried both the original burger and a Po boy lobster roll. I was sorely disappointed with both and neither were remotely worth their price. I'll start with the lobster roll, WORST LOBSTER ROLL EVER. The lobster roll I was able to finish in 2 big bites, which is ridiculous. I could have gotten a bigger roll with more lobster and a better tasting 1 from Luke's lobster for a couple dollars extra. Not only were there portion and price issues, but it was mostly claw meat from the lobster, not much tail meat. They probably won't fix this since they're a big chain now, but this is how you don't get repeat customers.The burger was a normal bacon cheese burger with no frills, was expecting slightly more from the burger since it's in their name. 1 order had truffle fries and the other had regular fries, both were ok, definitely needed more truffle oil on the truffle ones.If you like burgers and lobster rolls, I'd go somewhere else for each of them unless you have deep pockets or a very small appetite.",0
15138,"After launching a successful first Malaysian restaurant with a Michelin Star, they've decided to open Laut Singapura, another Pan Asian restaurant that leans toward Malaysian, Indonesian and Singaporean fare.The ambiance is upscale with full bar, the place is perfect for either a group or intimate dining. The menu is uncomplicated that we started ordering a few minutes after we were seated.We ordered the following dishes to share:1. Roti Telur; an Indian pancake with eggs, onions, scallions served with curry dipping sauce.2. Calamari Singapura; deep fried calamari with crispy rice, curry leaves and sambal, this by far is my favorite.3. Crispy chicken wings; for some reason we always order wings anywhere we dine, where it's available lol4. Singapore Laksa; signature egg noodle and lai fun mixWith coconut milk broth, chicken, fish balls, we found this dish perfect for sharing, just ask for two smaller bowls.5. Nasi Lemak; under signature menu, it's beef rendang with sambal, fried egg, fried anchovies, peanuts and coconut rice, mix it all together and share.We found most of the dishes really delicious and freshly made my only qualm is that we thought the serving of wine by the glass was way too stingy for the price, hence I took a star back. (generosity goes a long way).The staff and customer service here is fantastic. Ideal to bring visiting friends and relatives, we will definitely come back to try their other dishes on the menu.",0
17219,Authentic hole in the wall ramen place that is A+. They only accept cash but there are ATM seconds away. The best seller is the Mega Paitan but I stick with the Chicken Paitan and added corn. The food is made in front of you with fresh ingredients. They serve beer and soda.,0
3274,"Wanted to try this southern food place which had high reviews. Place had very nice decor and even a pianist playing past 7pm. Was a bit disappointed.There were some really great dishes - the fries with gravy, Mac and cheese. The gravy had lumps of meat in it which made it really tasty. Highly recommended. I added the Mac and cheese as a side. That's $9 for a cup on the side. It was very good, but $9 is a bit steep. I had the fried chicken, which was smaller than expected but probably a regular sized chicken. It didn't have the southern flavor I was expecting. Maybe it's a different part of the south. I thought southern food were all big sized and this looks more French sized. The broccoli mashed potatoes were interesting. Edible but not too much flavor in it. The meal comes with a biscuit so don't have to order extra, which I did as an appetizer. The biscuit was dense inside. Never had anything like it. Was decent with the jam though. I like corn bread better.  The shrimp and grits tasted like something out of a diner. Did not have the strong southern flavor.",0
16165,"Title: A Serendipitous Lunch at Felidia

My companion and I recently decided to have lunch at Felidia on a whim, and we couldn't have been more delighted with the outcome. Despite not having a reservation, fortune smiled upon us as we arrived during restaurant week. The establishment's policy required all at the table to partake in the coursed meal special, which we eagerly agreed to. It was a decision that paid off in dividends, allowing us to savor an array of exquisite dishes.

The highlight of our dining experience was undoubtedly the tartufo pasta. This truffle-infused homemade pasta, which came with a modest $10 upcharge, was simply divine. My husband, a staunch carbonara aficionado, proclaimed it the best pasta he's ever tasted—a sentiment I echo with gusto.

Our lunch at Felidia became more than just a meal; it was an experience. We reveled in the ambiance, occasionally eavesdropping on the intriguing conversations of business professionals and the retired elite, all the while enjoying our own slice of luxury.

In essence, our impromptu visit to Felidia was perfection on a plate. It offered us a taste of high-end dining in the heart of the city—a perfect respite for two Long Islanders on a casual day out.",1
12984,"Best Thai food I've had in the city. Everything here is good. I've never had a bad dish here. I love the chicken wrapped in pandan leaves appetizer. It is so fragrant, juicy, and soft. The eggplant basil and the pad kea mao are also great. I like that there are many meat options for each dish: tofu, vegetables, pork, chicken, mock duck, crispy duck, shrimp, squid. The crispy duck truly is crispy.  The decor is also really nice.Use the Yelp waitlist feature to avoid having to wait in person!",0
10223,"At Glur Thai, my affection for Thai cuisine has been met with an exceptional dining experience. The dishes here radiate with clean, vibrant flavors, each ingredient selected with care, ensuring ultimate freshness. Their coconut chicken soup has climbed to the top of my favorites—rich and satisfying. The corn fritters are a crunchy delight, while the chicken satay, accompanied by a delectable Thai peanut sauce, has set a new standard for future cravings.

The Pad Thai with Shrimp—a classic benchmark for authenticity—did not disappoint, hitting all the right notes. And as for the Pad See Ew, or as it should be renamed, ""Pad See Yum,"" it was a deliciously memorable dish. Glur Thai serves up impeccable Thai fare that tantalizes with every bite.",1

She was super nice and she offered me an extra selection because she has two favorites, but one would do thank you =) I think I am in love , not with the girl but with the chicken.",0
1459,"I came here for Rabbit House's soft opening 6-course omakase, and I think the restaurant has great potential if they implement more improvements before the grand opening. I came here with a friend on a Saturday night for a 6 pm reservation, and our waiter immediately served us spa water and sake bread sticks while we waited for the start of the first course. The restaurant gives a very cozy yet elegant hole-in-the-wall atmosphere, as there are less than a dozen seats available. First course - Set of 3 different snacks: egg with caviar served in an eggshell, sea urchin corn bread, and sake bloody mary oyster shot. The sea urchin corn bread was very tasty and the most innovative.Second course - foie gras with daikon Third course - poached salmon with turnip puree, tofu-mango sauce. The salmon was cooked very briefly, so the meat was very tender and not chewy. The turnip puree was like an Asian twist on mashed potatoes.Fourth course - signature trapped rabbit with carrots, shiitake mushroom, and spicy chocolate sauce. The most similar analogy of this dish is to a roulade or cordon bleu. The mole sauce also paired well with the rabbitFifth course - wagyu beef with summer truffle risotto. Bit disappointed that the chef didn't put actual truffle onto the dish, but nevertheless it was still a delicious grain dish, and the meat was melt-in-your-mouth tender.Sixth course (dessert) - sake poached pear and creme fraicheThere could be several aspects that the restaurant could improve on: The entire omakase was supposed to last about 90 minutes, but we unfortunately ended up going to almost two hours. My friend and I were also not full at all after the meal, which made the omakase price not so worth it. The heat circulation pretty poor. A few customers had to wear their coats halfway through the meal.",0
16192,"Title: Consistently Delightful with a Minor Hitch

I've become a regular at this spot, visiting over 20 times, and it's no surprise why. The service never misses a beat - swift and cordial every time. For anyone with a penchant for smoothies, their peanut butter, banana, chocolate, and almond milk concoction is a must-try. The 'create your own pasta' option is a personal favorite of mine - I usually go for a customized '14-5' mix, although they tempt me with a wallet-friendly $7.99 special on proteins with a choice of toppings throughout the week.

Their soups hit the spot, too. However, there's a slight drawback – the sandwiches. They don't prepare them fresh, offering only pre-made options from a display case. These can be a tad dry or, frankly, unappetizing unless you get them toasted or ask for extra mayo.

Coffee lovers will find their brew of a medium strength, and though not self-serve, it's prepared upon request. But it's the fresh and hearty servings of breakfast, pasta, salads, juices, and smoothies that truly stand out. Despite the sandwich hiccup, this place is a gem for its freshness and generous portions.",1
16222,"I recently had the pleasure of dining at this cozy Moroccan restaurant and was pleasantly surprised by the unique culinary experience it offered. As a first-timer to Moroccan cuisine, I was unsure what to expect, but the flavors truly impressed me. Both the steak and chicken tajine were standout dishes, offering a tender, flavorful journey for the tastebuds. The ambiance added to the authenticity of the meal. Whether you're a fan of Moroccan food or just looking to try something new, this charming spot is worth a visit. Highly recommended for its delightful dishes and warm atmosphere.",1
20672,"nom nom nom....this place is delicious and very unique...For starters, there is a hidden entrance. The restaurant is located down a secret hallway inside of the Le Parker Meridien Hotel. We had to ask someone where it was and they pointed to a curtain. I was super confused until we found the hallway and saw a long line of people. We were able to fill out a card with our order. I thought it was cool the cards were in different languages. We waited a few minutes and then were able to order. It did take a little bit of time to get our food but it was worth it. Our burgers were so fresh and delicious. This is def a small hole in the wall type of place and I would highly recommend.",0

A heartfelt thank you to the team for such a wonderful visit!",1
20792,"Despite the impressive quality of the food at this establishment, I regret to report that the overall dining experience was marred by subpar service. The waitress, while friendly in demeanor, fell short in attentiveness. A promised drink sample for my companion never materialized, even after an extended wait of 45 minutes for our meals. The necessity to actively signal for our server's attention, in a restaurant that was neither crowded nor understaffed, further detracted from the experience. Unfortunately, the lackluster service overshadowed the culinary excellence, resulting in a disappointing visit.",1
15751,"Delicious. The pizza is made to order, fresh and quality ingredients. It's traditional Italian pizza, so the size is for one person or to share as an appetizer or with another dish. The pasta is fresh and with a variety of sauces/ingredients. The truffle with mushrooms was outstanding. Cheesecake was light and fresh, not heavy and filling. Espresso was of quality. I love how the owner speaks Italian as so the waitstaff. It is authentic. Nothing has changed over the course of the time that I first started dining here.",0
12451,"Everything about this place is just okay. Service is okay, the food is okay, the restaurant is okay. There aren't many options for food but I think its because its a fairly new restaurant. My friend ordered the spicy mala and the server said it wasn't that spicy, but to her it was so we asked if we were able to switch the soup. It was obvious that he was annoyed when he was the one who told us he had no problem switching. I would give this place a 2.5 stars but unfortunately I cant so I'm rounding up to 3 stars. Good location, however I don't think I'll be coming back.",0
18455,"Title: A Satisfying Soba Experience at Soba Azuma, NYC

During my stay in NYC, I had the pleasure of dining at Soba Azuma, a spot I had eagerly anticipated visiting. This authentic Japanese eatery captured my heart with its reasonable prices and generous portions that provide great value for money. It was refreshing to enjoy traditional Japanese soba in a non-fusion setting, reflecting the simplicity of Japan's culinary culture.

I indulged in a large (300g) serving of Cold soba with seaweed and grated daikon for just $12.50. Despite opting for the larger size, my appreciation for Japanese cuisine and the excitement of finally trying Soba Azuma meant the meal was satisfying without being excessive – I relished every bite.

Arriving early for a Sunday lunch meant I avoided the crowds, but I'd certainly advise groups to reserve in advance. The cozy size of the restaurant makes it a popular choice, and one that you wouldn't want to miss out on by facing a wait or the possibility of not being seated.

In summary, Soba Azuma is a gem for those seeking an authentic, wallet-friendly Japanese noodle experience in the heart of New York City.",1
10595,"I recently dined at [Restaurant Name], and unfortunately, I must report that my experience was rather disappointing. The one beacon of light in the meal was the chocolate egg cream, which I found delightful and palatable.

However, my main course, the Bigos, fell short of expectations. Traditionally hearty, what I received lacked the robustness of a stew and was not studded with the kielbasa and roast pork as one would anticipate. The provided photo illustrates the scant meat within the dish.

Additionally, the side of mashed potatoes was a letdown; their flavor and texture suggested they were far from freshly prepared, leaving much to be desired. The potato pancake also missed the mark, as it was not fried to the crispiness that one typically looks forward to.

In summary, while the restaurant offered a promising chocolate egg cream, the remainder of the meal was lacking in both quality and authenticity.",1
13639,"I had a wonderful birthday dinner here! The food, drinks and down to the service was all great. I absolutely love the big eye tuna tart with truffle chips on top and the scallop roll that melts in your mouth! And my favorite was the Uni in the scallop and Uni in the oysters!!!

3566,"WOW. While I don't love that you have to wait in line or how close together the stools are, it's all part of the experience. I came at 3 on a Friday to avoid a huge line and didn't have to wait at all. However two hours later it's usually a 45 min wait. The hand rolls are absolutely delicious. From the warm rice to the high quality fish, every bite melts in your mouth. I ordered the 6 rolls for $29 and skipped breakfast in preparation. Was definitely very full after. It's hard to pick a favorite, as each roll is amazing, but the salmon, lobster, and toro stuck out. Top 5 sushi experiences in ny for sure.",0

I ventured into this cozy restaurant with some reservations, particularly about rice noodles, which aren't typically my go-to. To my surprise, their ""Cross the Bridge Noodle"" (过桥米线) provided a pleasant culinary experience. The broth reminded me of a classic chicken noodle soup – simple, yet satisfying. While the dish didn't venture into extraordinary territory, it exuded a lovely homey vibe that brought comfort food to mind. A solid 3.5-star experience for anyone looking for a no-frills, good-quality meal.",1
1767,"Title: Service Slump at Wok Wok

My recent visit to Wok Wok, a place I've frequented in the past, was unfortunately marred by noticeably poorer service. Despite being seated promptly at 6:45 PM, attention from the staff was scarce due to a large party requiring their focus.

Ordering ahead of the group at 7:06 PM, it was disheartening to learn at 7:30 PM that our order had been overlooked due to a misplaced slip. It seemed all hands were on deck for the larger group, resulting in their meals arriving before ours, despite our proactive effort to order swiftly.

Compensation for the wait came in the form of a free Thai iced tea refill, an offer that felt underwhelming given our hunger. After an additional 15-minute delay, our food arrived with my Pad Thai missing bean sprouts per my request. Unfortunately, the presentation left the impression of a dish that had been hastily prepared.

In summary, the combination of delayed service and the final presentation dampened the dining experience, marking a noticeable decline in the standard I've come to expect from Wok Wok.",1
12782,"Title: A Cajun Delight in the Heart of New York

Last night's dinner at this bustling New York Cajun gem transported me back to the vibrant flavors I've been missing since my time in Hawaii, observing the unfortunate decline in the popularity of such establishments.

Despite the crowd at 8 pm, the service was prompt and professional. We dived into Combo A, a hearty mix of head-on shrimp and crawfish – both generous in portion, perfectly spiced at a medium level, and accompanied by corn and potatoes. Although the sauce was rich and plentiful, sadly, we couldn't finish it all.

The establishments' layout offers a dynamic dining experience, whether you prefer the bar, a table, or a counter with handy hooks for personal items. Our server's attentiveness and the complimentary still water upon seating were commendable touches.

Practicality shines with large hand-washing basins at the back and well-maintained, multi-occupant restrooms, rounding out an evening where the only faux pas was our inability to savor every last drop of that exquisite sauce.",1

329,"I live down the street so this is a great option for a vegan quick bite. I have tried the guac burger, pesto meatball sandwich, spicy Thai salad, and air baked fries (both regular and sweet potato). The ketchup is good - it is made from beets. If you leave the fries out too long, they get a little soggy so eat them quickly! The prices are reasonable so try what you want. If you want to avoid meat products but don't have a lot of time, this is the perfect place to have a bite.",0
256,"NY Pizza Suprema comes with celebrity endorsements and high expectations, but sadly, it doesn't deliver on the hype. At $5 a slice, one might expect a gourmet experience, but what I got was far from it. The meatball pizza underwhelmed with an unexpectedly sweet sauce that overpowered the flavors, reminding me more of a jam topping rather than a robust, savory marinara. In a city dotted with affordable and delicious options, I've enjoyed much better pizzas for half the price. Overrated and overpriced, NY Pizza Suprema was a disappointment.",1
1599,"This place is definitely worth a visit! Reminds me of Indochine, but definitely different flavors as this one is Indonesian and French rather than Vietnamese and French. The interior of this place is very modern and dazzling. It's definitely a nice and intimate space with a lively atmosphere. The menu itself isn't too big, but all the plates are meant to be shared. To start, my friend and I got the chicken satay which was drizzled with this rich peanut sauce. Very flavorful, not the most tender in terms of texture, but overall yummy. We also got the crispy squid which had this tangy and sweet taste. Great crunch and chewy on the inside. For our mains we got the lobster noodles and the sea bass. The lobster noodles were the star of the show for sure. The noodles are much like ramen noodle with spice for kick and the lobster was cooked well. The sea bas was very tender and served in banana leaves. Great presentation and delicious. As for our dessert, I'm not sure what the name was as it was verbally told to us but it had this lovely caramelized banana with banana bread and two scoops of ice cream - one vanilla and one black sesame. Our waiter was also extremely attentive and nice. Definitely worth a visit and return!",0
20178,"Had our first-ever brunch experience here today and it was nothing short of amazing! I indulged in the chicken and waffles alongside beef empanadas paired with a refreshing mojito. Each bite was a delight with the chicken, a surprisingly tender faux meat that even mimicked bones, so do watch out for that realistic touch. The girls enjoyed a fresh salad and a hearty portion of steak and eggs, and they couldn't stop raving about their choices. To top it off, DJ MARZ was in the house, bringing some serious vibes and representing for the Haitian community. A brunch not to be missed!",1
12568,"I ate here with a small group of friends back in February. We all really loved this place! There aren't too many options for Korean fried chicken in the UES, and Chicken Insider definitely satiates the craving.My friends and I shared a few sandwiches and a box of the crispy boneless chicken. The chicken is perfectly breaded and fried, with a beautifully crispy crust on the outside and moist chicken on the inside. You also don't get the oily/heavy feeling that you sometimes encounter at other fried chicken places. We also had the opportunity to try a variety of different sauces. Each one was really unique and tasty -- try the spicy thai chili for something a bit different.The staff members were all courteous and helpful. They were extremely patient with us even though we came in shortly before they were supposed to close on a Sunday night. Highly recommended for those in need of a Korean fried chicken fix on the UES!",0

I went on a Saturday night; it was comfortably bustling with a perfect mix for an easygoing atmosphere. The interior is modest yet charming, creating a welcoming space. The standout, besides the food, was the staff—always smiling and incredibly courteous. As someone who enjoys exploring local dining options, I can confidently place this restaurant in my top 5. Highly recommend for an authentic and enjoyable meal!",1
1558,"Was told that brunch wasn't ""worth dropping an 'amazing' for,"" but I would drop an amazing. I got the short rib hash and it was SO delicious. It came piping in a cast iron skillet, and my only complaint is that it burnt my tongue (my own fault), but everything else was perfect. The flavorful jalapeño grits, the tender short rib, the two beautiful pearls of poached eggs, the mountain of shoestring potatoes, what more could I have wanted?I also started with a hot chocolate which came with the most delightful whipped cream. My friends ordered the ranchero hash and vanilla French toast, and they both loved their dishes too. Definitely a little pricey ($5.50 hot cocoa) but if you're looking for a splurgey brunch, I would definitely get the short rib again.",0
2559,"Title: Delicious Seafood at Luke's Lobster with a Tiny Letdown

I had a delightful dining experience at Luke's Lobster! Their lobster and crab rolls are incredible and truly something to drool over. The service was excellent and only added to the mouthwatering meal. However, I'm giving it four stars instead of five due to some minor inconsistencies. Unlike other Luke's locations, the trio here did not include pickles and crab claws even though the price was unchanged – a small detail that was slightly disappointing. Also, be aware that this particular establishment is a bit hidden, nestled in the basement of a hotel/residential building, which made finding the entrance a tad challenging. Remember to ask for pickles if you want them, but rest assured, the taste does not disappoint!",1
15288,"Title: A Fair Slice at Joe's New York Pizza

After hearing endless praise for New York pizza, and Joe's in particular, I stepped in with high expectations. The pizza was indeed good, but I wouldn't elevate it to the extraordinary status others have. What I did appreciate was the distinct chewy texture of the crust, a pleasant departure from the norm. However, the tomato sauce left something to be desired, lacking the depth of flavor I typically enjoy. A sprinkle of crushed peppers, oregano, and extra cheese did help enhance the experience.

In comparison to my usual pizza back in California, Joe's didn't quite stand out as significantly superior. It's a decent option, particularly when considering other similar-priced $1 slices in the vicinity, but not the culinary marvel I was led to expect.",1
15434,"A very solid sushi spot in the UWS. I came here on a Tuesday night with my gf towards their closing hour. It was still somewhat packed and we didn't feel rushed at all.The service I'd say is fair. The server is pretty friendly and patient. We weren't rush out the door because there was only 60 minutes left from the time we were seated. Getting their attention was an issue to fill up on water or to place our order in.I ordered two different sushi rolls:Spider Roll - This contains soft shell crab, avocado, masago, and spicy mayo. One of my favorite food is the soft shell crab so this was a must have. You only get 5 pieces, but they're massive in diameter and they taste great. I even dipped it in the spicy mango sauce that came with my other roll I ordered. The mango flavor adds to what is already a solid roll.Lobster Roll - This is one of their specialty rolls that includes lobster, mango, and avocado wrapped in soy paper. It comes with a spicy mango sauce which I love. For the amount of mango they pack into this, it surprisingly blends in with the avocado and lobster. If you want more of that mango taste, there's that sauce.Overall, I was very satisfied with the sushi rolls that I ordered. The service could be a little better by being more tentative to their customers. I have to say the sushi were on the pricey side. The two rolls costed close to $40-$45 which is a lot. I guess you pay for what it's worth, good quality sushi.",0
2197,"Title: A Delightful Veggie Haven with a Thai Twist

My love for Thai cuisine drew me back to Spice, a gem for those seeking vegetarian options. The inclusion of a vegetarian code on the menu is a thoughtful touch that made ordering a breeze.

On this visit, I ventured into the vegan dumplings. While they were satisfactory, the plum sauce didn't hit the mark, hinting at a slight burnt taste. The garden delight paired with brown rice was a hearty choice but was marred by an overzealous hand with the salt.

The beverage highlight was undoubtedly the fresh coconut water—it was refreshing bliss, served with a flair that rivals any fancy cocktail.

The ambiance of Spice is a treasure—dim lighting and great tunes set the stage for impeccable customer service. This eatery is not only a fantastic date night locale but also shines with its lunch specials and enticing happy hour.

In essence, while the flavors hit a couple of snags, the overall experience at Spice keeps the spirit of Thai food alive and well, especially for those favoring the greener side of the menu.",1
12139,"We recently opted for a dinner take out from this local spot and went with the sushi for two. True to its word, the portion was generous, ensuring a satisfying meal. The tuna and spicy tuna rolls particularly stood out, with fresh flavors that hit the mark. The sweet shrimp also left a pleasant impression, though the fried shrimp didn’t quite meet the same standard – simply passable. Based on the overall experience, this place has earned a repeat visit for future take out meals.",1
12794,"We came here on a Sunday for brunch around noon. We did make a reservation, and I recommend making a reservation if you plan on eating brunch here on the weekend. The restaurant is tightly packed. The ambiance is average. We ordered the Bodega Sammie ($17), which comes with fries. The best part of this sandwich is that it is on focaccia bread. It is better than your average BEC. The fries are thin cut. We also ordered the French Toast ($14), served with pecans and bananas and a great whipped cream. Overall, this is a good place to grab brunch, but nothing amazing. You will find your average brunch items here.",0
13387,"Title: Disappointing Fare at a ""Thai"" Eatery

Upon entering the charming and impeccably clean establishment conveniently situated near a subway station, my hopes were high for a delightful Thai experience. The service was decent enough, but regrettably, that's where the positives ended.

The Massaman curry, a dish I have long cherished, was unrecognizable—a watery concoction resembling coconut soup with a haphazard sprinkle of chilis, onions, tofu, and peanuts. The absence of traditional vegetables and potatoes was a culinary misstep that did not escape my notice. 

Crab rangoon, one of my favored American-Thai indulgences, was a letdown with its unconventional pastry dough shell that was too delicate to contain its filling, resulting in an odd texture.

Even my partner's chicken dish failed to impress, reminiscent of a mundane meal kit delivery service, and was accompanied by a meager portion of rice.

The final straw was the bill. For an appetizer, a single soft drink, and two modestly portioned entrees, the price was a staggering $65. The cost, an apparent attempt to cover high rent, could not justify the substandard food served.

In summary, this restaurant falls short of authentic Thai cuisine, offering overpriced and unsatisfying dishes. Good luck to them—their business model is as unsustainable as their recipes are un-Thai.",1
1020,"Tucked away from the bustling streets, this restaurant is a true hidden gem. Despite its narrow confines, which can become quite snug in peak hours, the ambiance retains a charming allure. The culinary experience is top-notch. I indulged in a Cubano Sandwich that far exceeded my expectations with its delectable flavors. Complementing my meal, the mango shake was a delightful refreshment. While I've not explored the daily specials yet, they're on my list for future visits. This is a spot I'm eager to return to – more culinary delights await!",1
14022,"I ordered the Duck Enchiladas and the Brussels Sprouts for delivery.The duck enchiladas were $16. Not worth it. I was disappointed. The duck itself was over cooked and very dry. Duck is normally oily and juicy. I was hesitant to order this at first when I saw chocolate mole. I should have listened to my gut instinct lol. It did not work with the dish. The shaved lettuce, jalapeños, onion and cotija cheese and sour cream was good. I wouldn't order this again, and I don't recommend it. Waste of $16.The Brussels sprouts were $9. They came with Mexican chorizo, cherry gastrique and crispy leaves as described. It was delicious! All the flavors worked well. Crispy leaves and the chorizo was perfectly cooked. I definitely recommend trying these! Great portion too for $9. I'd order these again.Overall decent quality and order arrived hot and on time without any spills.",0
3198,"Title: Cozy Dinner with Fine Sangrias and Friendly Service

Last week, my girlfriend and I had the pleasure of dining at this local spot on a weekday evening. Without a reservation, we were fortunate enough to be seated immediately, although the welcome from the stoic male host lacked warmth. 

Choosing to start at the bar, we were impressed by the sangria selection. Our choice of peach sangria was delightful and perfect for a light evening drink. The array of rosés on display suggested that this was a place for wine lovers, particularly if rosé is your preference.

Moving on to our table in the not-yet-busy restaurant, the food did not disappoint. From the perfectly seared diver scallops to the generous and flavorful paella filled with fresh seafood, each dish was a testament to the kitchen's quality. The apple tart that rounded off our meal was exceptional, with its thinly sliced apples and exquisite taste – a must-try for any diner.

The highlight of the evening was undeniably our female server whose jovial and attentive service enriched our dining experience. Her enthusiasm for our menu choices and her knowledge of the offerings were greatly appreciated, inspiring my desire to return.

Despite the initial lukewarm greeting, the experience was a success, buoyed by delicious food and exemplary service later on. I look forward to my next visit.",1

15879,"We were in town visiting from Florida and heard about this great taco spot. Being slightly skeptical,  we stopped by and had a few tacos for lunch. The line was out the door and on the sidewalk, but it moved decently. It only took us about 15 minutes to get our food. The place is pretty chaotic and a bit disorganized, but it worked. We got to the counter and ordered a pastor taco and a carne asada. We paid and they gave us a ticket while asking us to slide down. There were multiple stations where you gave the guys making tacos your ticket and they gave you your order. This took less than 5 minutes. Trying to find a spot to sit or stand was tough. We ended up crammed in the corner. We dug into out tacos and they were good. They were certainly above average, but not life changing as they had been described. The flavor and texture was nice on both. Overall, we enjoyed our visit. It was nice to try out one of the highest rated taco spots in the area, but it was a bit more hectic than I anticipated.",0
19934,"Brought here for my birthday. I still love this place and our server, Delores is awesome. She's such a sweetie. And me being a southern raised gal, she is all the southern charm a Bubba Gump needs in one body. I hope she's our server next time we come.",0
12346,"Title: A Memorable Culinary Experience in the Heart of Manhattan

I recently had the pleasure of dining with family at a stellar steakhouse located in Manhattan's Meat Packing District. From the moment we ordered, the experience was exceptional. We started with their delightful bread served with a decadent blue cheese butter that literally melted in your mouth.

While the menu boasts an impressive selection of dishes, I opted for the steak, as I believe one should at a steak restaurant. It was a decision I didn't regret, as the steak arrived flawlessly cooked to my liking. Accompanying side dishes were just as noteworthy, with the thick truffle french fries deserving a special mention – they were simply sublime.

Although I didn't try it this time, the corn pudding caught my eye for a future visit. Desserts were equally tempting, featuring a show-stopping ice cream enveloped in cotton candy which was theatrically melted at the table. This unique dessert not only satisfied the taste buds but also provided an exclusive experience that distinguishes this establishment from other steak houses in New York City.

Overall, the combination of perfect food, an array of choices, and the enchanting dessert spectacle made for a delightful dining experience I highly recommend to anyone looking for exceptional steak in Manhattan.",1
3661,"From the moment I stepped into the restaurant, I was greeted with a sleek and stylish modern chic ambiance. Despite the bustling crowd, the service did not skip a beat; the staff was attentive and ready to assist at any moment.

The menu features an array of specialty drinks, which are a must-try for cocktail enthusiasts. Although the swordfish I ordered was only satisfactory, the polenta with fungi truly shone, proving to be a delectable highlight of the meal (regrettably, I didn't capture a photograph).

Dessert did not disappoint, with the gelato offerings being particularly scrumptious. Out of the flavors sampled, the mocha stood out as the ultimate favorite.

In summary, while the main course was somewhat lackluster, the overall dining experience, marked by great service, delightful drinks, and a memorable dessert, was worth the visit.",1
2121,"I'm a sucker for well designed interiors, and I honestly came here initially for their rustic aesthetic. The reviews were also good enough to justify my visit. My friend and I came about 20 minutes before closing, but they took orders up until their close time. My friend ordered their Pad See Ew with pork, and I ordered the basil fried rice. We both got our food within a reasonable amount of time. Holy. Crap. Their food is some of the best Thai food I've ever had. Thai food is usually pretty basic and similar among establishments, but Up Thai clearly differentiates themselves. You have to try it to see what I mean. Their pork was well cooked and tender, and the noodles were well spiced and soft. My basil fried rice was a lot spicier than I would've preferred, but it was my fault for not saying something to the waitress. Service was also wonderful; the waiters don't interrupt you and silently fill your water every time it reaches below 3/4 full. This is a really delicious Thai restaurant, and I highly recommend it. I want to come by and try their other food.",0
12342,"Imo, joes is the king of New York pizza. It's fast, it's cheap, it's ubiquitous, it's delicious...and for all those reasons it's a hard 5 star rating from me. A large pizza (and truly a large, like a feed 3 people large, not like a NY boujee ""feeds two at most with several apps"" large) runs you about $21 with a little extra for toppings. The sauce is impeccable, the cheese is divine, the crust is hearty but not overwhelming...all in all this is New York pizza at its best. Props to chose for becoming a tourist destination without losing its heart; few places in New York maintain their native clout while also servicing the b&t crowd and Joe's has managed to do so. I will always order for a reliable, delicious, cheap meal.",0
21051,"Title: A Late-Night Delight at NYC's Artichoke Pizza Haven

I must confess, I was a stranger to the concept of artichoke pizza until a recent foray into the nocturnal bustle of New York City transformed my pizza perceptions. Following a friend's recommendation, we navigated the lively city streets and were greeted by the equally vivacious atmosphere of a pizza establishment brimming with activity even at 1am.

Despite the throng of night owls vying for a taste, service was swift. A mere $6 secured me a colossal slice of their signature artichoke pizza. The generous portion size matched by its scrumptious taste made it unquestionably worth every penny.

In hindsight, would I indulge in this unique pizza again? Absolutely—sober or tipsy, the allure of that creamy artichoke topping is undeniable. When my travels bring me back to the city that never sleeps, a return to this pizza sanctuary is irrefutably on my agenda.",1
2104,"This place used to be a bank vault and converted into a restaurant. There were two vault doors and was very interesting. The place was packed when we went, probably because of an event nearby. However, still recommend to make a reservation. The service was ok. The food wasn't bad, but wasn't special. It was a great experience if you haven't been.",0
11993,"I was looking for a French restaurant to dine at before our evening play and this lovely little place popped up. Located in the crazy, busy theater district although easy to find.We were seated in the very back of the restaurant at an intimate and cozy table.  The ambiance of this french restaurant is so lovely. I felt like I had been transported back to Paris with the decor. Ellen our server quickly greeted us and was so friendly. From the beginning of our meal to the end, she provided such great service and upped our experience.I already knew what I was going to order as I had reviewed the menu a couple days before. We chose not to eat the Prix Fix Theater dinner, but it did look good. With that said, I ordered the Potato/Leek soup, the Coq Au Vin and a delicious glass of their french Bordeaux. My daughter ordered the Potato/Leek soup, Ratatouille and a glass of champagne. Oh my! Everything we ordered was absolutely delicious. From the soup that was just filled with flavorful leeks but was so creamy to the Ratatouille which was laden with fresh summer squash, zucchini, tomato. The wonderful thing about NYC food is the vegetables and fruit are so tasty and don't have to travel across a desert before they are served (Ha! Ha!). My Coq Au Vin was also so heavenly with the tender chicken melting in my mouth and the fingerling potatoes seasoned just right.We ended our meal with the Peach Melba was that was absolutely scrumptious. I wish we could have lingered here longer but we had to get to our show.I will definitely return here again next time I am in NYC and request Ellen!",0

183,"My visit to the restaurant was a fairly average experience. The Jambon Omelette, featuring ham, mushroom, and cheese, was adequate but undistinguished, lacking the zest that a dash of spice could have provided. The home fries, however, were a pleasant surprise and I found myself quite enjoying their flavor and texture. Service was attentive, though it was marred by an underlying sense of haste which suggested a priority on table turnover. Overall, it's not a destination I'd eagerly recommend.",1
17699,"Title: Szechuan Delight at Chow House

My visit to Chow House was nothing short of awesome, echoing another Yelp reviewer's advice to ""come early or be prepared to wait"" for some scrumptious Szechuan cuisine. The reason for the crowds became clear with their extensive food selection and tempting drink specials, especially bustling on the weekends.

Post laughter from the nearby Comedy Cellar, we found solace in this gem for affordably priced Asian fare. The soup dumplings, particularly the crabmeat and pork variety, were sumptuous. On the liquid indulgence side, the sake, margaritas, and Singha beer did not disappoint.

Classics like spicy beef tendon and mapo tofu were represented in their full glory. Our waiter exuded friendliness, enhancing our dining experience in the surprisingly spacious establishment. Extra culinary details, such as garlic-seasoned sautéed snow peas and perfectly crisped pan-fried dumplings, were a testament to their thoughtful preparation.

Chow House is a no-frills spot that's big on flavor and light on the wallet, perfectly situated for an evening of adventure. Definitely a strategic pick for any weekend night out in the area.",1
11243,"Ordered delivery from here and it was a terrible experience. I ordered through DoorDash and as the Dasher went to go pick up my order, the restaurant told him they hadn't started preparing it because their prices on DoorDash were wrong by $2. They said they wouldn't prepare the food until they got the $2 (actually more, because they said the $2 should also have tax on top of it..). I asked my Dasher to help me pay in cash and I would pay him back. Im very willing to overlook this $2 and whatever cents with tax as I know businesses are struggling but how they handled this and the food itself is why I'm giving the poor review. Once the good came it was absolutely awful. The chicken was cold, rubbery and not mixed in at all (literally cold chicken on top of noodles with barely any sauce - please look at the photos I posted). The vegetables tasted old as well. I really hate to give businesses a bad review during this time, but this actually was really bad food and an overall really poor experience.",0
3106,"Title: A Hotpot Haven in the Heart of NYC

As an out-of-towner, my quest for authentic hotpot led me to a bustling spot in NYC, shattering my previous hotpot experiences. Contrary to some 'run of the mill' reviews, this restaurant offers an all-you-can-eat format that truly elevates the experience. The sheer variety and quality make each penny of the set price feel justified, especially compared to the a la carte hotpot I'm used to back home.

The hour-long wait, while initially daunting, turned out to be absolutely worth it. An adjacent tea shop provided a cozy waiting area and once inside, the thoughtful service began with the simple but genius offer to bag our coats, safeguarding them from lingering food aromas.

Opting for the spicy pot, I was hooked by its complex flavors and the accompanying condiment bar that was a foodie's playground. My Chinese friends orchestrated our table's symphony of dishes, leaving me to the joyful task of savoring each bite. 

The birthday celebrations here are a spectacle, complete with a zany mascot and a boisterous song - entertainment at its finest, as long as you're not the center of attention.

For any hotpot aficionado or novice, I would readily recommend this gem. I'm left with memories of a delightful culinary experience to tide me over until my next New York visit.",1

I may have just found my top sushi destination in NYC, rivaling the famed Nakazawa and closely followed by Omakase Room by Tatsu. While I've yet to experience Masa, this exquisite spot surpasses many renowned places like Sushi Ginza Onodera, 15 East, noda, Yasuda, and Gari. The only downside is the eye-watering price of sake; more wallet-friendly options would be appreciated. Nevertheless, the meal was so spectacular that it offset this minor quibble.

The waiters are so attentive and the sushi chef is so patient. Our meal took about an hour and a half, they don't rush you at all! There are 3 options - 11 pieces for $85, 14 pieces for $105 and 27 pieces for $125. We each got the 14 pieces and we were so full after! The sushi here is fresh and is traditional like that of Japan, but the flavor is there. I also love that the rice is warm. My favorite pieces were the chutoro of course, the torched mackerel and surprisingly, the botan ebi with uni because I usually don't like raw shrimp. The sake was ~$20 a glass but it was huge. Definitely recommend, you really get a good deal.",0

12436,"I recently discovered a hidden gem of a Japanese cantine and couldn't resist sharing my experience. The place exudes an under-the-radar charm that only adds to its allure. I was immensely impressed with the quality of food served here - it was nothing short of delicious and the portions generous.

Anyone with a penchant for authentic Japanese cuisine would be remiss not to try their katsudon. The pork cutlets were perfectly fried, tender, and came nestled on a bed of warm rice, topped with a beautifully cooked egg and scallions. It's evident the dish is made to order with great care.

Despite the remarkable quality, the prices are incredibly reasonable - honestly, it feels like you're getting more than what you pay for. My plate was so plentiful, I had enough to take home for another meal.

For those in the know, this place is a must-visit for an array of fantastic Japanese meals and snacks. Just keep your eyes peeled - this cantine is easy to miss if you're not looking for it, but it's a find you'll be glad you made.",1

17997,"Title: A Capital Experience at The Capital Grille

I embraced Restaurant Week with a visit to The Capital Grille, where the ambiance of the historic Equitable Building mesmerized me. The transformation of a former bank vault into an entrance for private dining rooms is nothing short of stunning—a must-see.

The culinary journey began with the velvety clam chowder, brimming with generous clam pieces, and a green salad dressed in the most exquisite Parmesan vinaigrette—a cheese lover’s dream.

Our beverage selections, the Blackberry Bourbon cocktail and an Old Fashion, were perfectly crafted, setting the stage for the main event. The Bone-In Dry Aged NY Strip steaks, accompanied by lobster and jumbo shrimp respectively, were divine. The steak's pairing with the buttery mashed potatoes was a match made in heaven.

A minor hiccup with the doneness of one steak was swiftly handled by our attentive waiter, Donavon, whose commitment to service excellence ensured a perfectly cooked replacement arrived without delay—his service was exemplary.

We concluded with the decadent chocolate cake, a symphony of flavors with the tart raspberries providing a delightful counterpoint. Despite being full, surrendering to its deliciousness was inevitable.

Overall, The Capital Grille is an impeccable choice for a memorable dining experience. I look forward to my return. Highly recommended!",1

The broth delivered a subtle Taiwanese flavor without being overpowering, a highlight for those who appreciate nuanced tastes. The beef, well-stewed and tender, impressed me, showcasing the kitchen's skill in meat preparation. However, I was disappointed by the improper noodle selection for a dish that is named for its key ingredient.

2531,"This has to be my favorite happy hour spot with great tasting oysters. Their happy hour specials run daily from 4pm to 7pm which include $1 raw oysters and clams (minimum of 6), $5 select wines/beers, $9 select cocktails, and shareables ranging from $4 to $9. The Connecticut raw oysters are fresh and delicious (sweet and not sandy). I love that they come with the cocktail sauce, horseradish ice, and mignonette. The fries are amazingly crispy and hot - pesto is my favorite but they're all good and come with ketchup and a tartar sauce. The lobster ravioli is a must get every time and comes with a salsa and queso sauce. From the regular menu, I've tried the grilled oysters and fried oysters ($3.50 each and minimum 6) which were both wonderful. The paella was nothing special so I'd probably pass on that next time but it was overflowing with seafood. As for drinks, I don't think you can't go wrong with any of their options. I've had the flatiron mule, sagarita, and summer breeze sangria which were all very good.The restaurant gets packed around 6pm but I can see why with their HH menu. The only downside is that the service could be more attentive especially if you're seated upstairs with one staff member running back and forth and our water glasses could be filled more regularly. It can get extremely loud and even though there's a full house, we never felt rushed at any point. Definitely loved the atmosphere and nautical feel of the whole place.",0

I think my wife got the Greg Norman burger and I can't remember what I had. (See what I mean, good, but not so good as to be memorable.)The shake was memorable. We got a choco taco shake that was insane. It had an entire choco taco sticking out of the side of an already huge shake.

14406,"Title: Authentic Japanese Flavors at Nippori

Last Wednesday night, my visit to Nippori revealed why it's a favorite among the Japanese locals – a sure sign of authenticity. The restaurant wasn't crowded, yet the air was filled with the buzz of native Japanese conversation. Led there by a friend well-versed in Japan's finest, we dove into the menu with high expectations.

We started with Shishito peppers, a simple dish that did not disappoint in its execution – delightfully tasty. The takoyaki followed, but unfortunately, they didn't hit the same high, being a tad overwhelmed by the sauce.

The star of the show was the Samurai Ramen. Its original ""tonkotsu"" pork bone broth, simmered for 10 hours, boasted a richness and the perfect touch of saltiness that forced me to savor every last drop – a rare occurrence for me. The toppings, from the perfectly cooked egg to the tender charshuu pork, added layers of enjoyment to the dish.

However, the experience was slightly marred by the lackluster service. Despite the sparse occupancy, servers paid us little attention, and we found ourselves flagging them down for orders and refills.

With a little perk of a free beer for Yelp check-ins, Nippori certainly knows how to entice. In the realm of ramen restaurants in the city, Nippori has set a high bar for my future explorations.",1

A friend's recommendation led me to embark on a journey out of the hustle of Midtown to a quaint ramen spot near the Bronx, and I'm pleased to report it was a triumphant venture. Arriving at 5pm sharp for their opening, my party of five was greeted by a burgeoning line, indicative of the restaurant's local renown. Seated promptly despite the crowd, we plunged into their distinctive cocktail menu.

The Pineapple Cocktail was a personal favorite, boasting an impressive presentation, while the Grapefruit Cocktail will be a hit for any aficionado of smoky bourbon flavors.

The star of the evening was the Kyoto ramen, the establishment's crown jewel, featuring a delectable fish-based broth that sets it apart from the sea of ramen offerings in NYC. The ample noodles and well-suited toppings created an orchestra of flavors in a single bowl. Meanwhile, the Yokosuka Curry Mazemen, though a departure from traditional broth-centric ramen, was a delightful nod to curry lovers with its robust taste.

Belying its location, the restaurant's rapid fill-up is a testament to its exceptional fare. The trek may be long, but for a unique twist on ramen paired with innovative cocktails, this spot proves its worth and then some.",1

First they accidentally brought us 2 mojitos and when we said it wasn't ours, they gave it to us for free, which was cool.I had the carnitas tacos. I think the portion size was pretty small so I also had the elotes ($5) which were very delicious. I liked the corn grilled with the mayonnaise type of flavor and cheese. My friend was celebrating her birthday and when we told the waiters, they brought us free tequila shots and a small cake/candle. That was so sweet! With the yelp check in, which took 25 percent off of a bill of $30 or more, our bill which was originally $240 became $180.

My boyfriend and I were treated to a truly exemplary dining experience, thanks in no small part to our fantastic waiter, Grant.

The steak was a marvel of culinary excellence, aged to perfection, and so tender it seemed to dissolve on the tongue. Each bite was a symphony of natural umami and flawless seasoning.

My boyfriend's choice of medium well for his steak hit the mark, revealing a sweet spot of doneness that, admittedly, outshone my medium rare selection. The Canadian bacon appetizer was another triumph; thick, succulent slices of charred belly bacon that exemplified the adage ""fat is flavor."" We complemented our meat feast with a side of crispy Brussels, which, while a tad oily, were quite enjoyable.

For those in search of an authentic New York steak experience, this is the place. The meat is undeniably the star of the show, and you're guaranteed to leave satisfied. Just remember to arrive with an appetite to match the generous portions.",1
19328,"I absolutely adore itsu! It's reasonably price than other sushi Japanese places, the quality of the food is there and it's quick and fast. Most of the items are self-served, they are pre-packaged and ready to go but they are made fresh everday for serving. I've tried the sushi package and the thai coconut veggie soup. The thai coconut veggie soup was packed with flavor served in just the right amount size bowl. The sushi is pretty average and aligns with most competitors but you can't beat the price compared to other places. It seems to be in a hidden path, not that it's hard to find but since there's construction being done within that building, it can be quite easy to miss. The interior and design is great, it's modernize and well though out such as the utensils used for the soup and the compact size cardboard tray filled with the story behind itsu. Within each table you can find a great selection of sauces besides the standard soy sauce. There's so many other dishes I want to try at itsu...the other soup offerings, sides, salads, and rice bowls!",0
3316,"Title: A Gem in LES – Rosie's Mexican Cuisine

I finally checked Rosie's off my must-visit list, and it certainly did not disappoint! Nestled in the Lower East Side, this bustling Mexican eatery provided a delightful dining experience for my group of five on a lively Saturday night.

Without the option for weekend dinner reservations, we were initially concerned about the wait time, but the accommodating staff had us sipping drinks at the bar in no time – the wait flew by. The culinary highlight was the guacamole, a perfect starter for the variety of tacos we shared. Surprisingly, the cactus tacos emerged as the unanimous favorite!

Our servers were the epitome of warmth, extending a friendly vibe from the moment we were greeted. Despite the busy atmosphere, our food arrived swiftly, within a mere 10-15 minutes. Rosie's smartly designed open-air seating accommodates the inside crowd and offers outside dining for those looking to enjoy the warm weather.

In essence, Rosie's is a must-visit for anyone craving authentic Mexican flavors paired with an energetic yet welcoming ambiance. Highly recommend for a night out in the LES!",1
10366,"Lives up to the hype!So down to earth while also upscale, with highly attentive yet not suffocating service. Nicest wait, somm, and bar staff I've ever had the pleasure of encountering! Everyone had such great personality, and seemed to really love their job and want to be there. They knew the menu items through and through - we were particularly impressed with the (young and hip and lady!) sommelier, who has a crazy encyclopedic knowledge of wines and wine regions.The food was delicious, from the pickled veg at the bar, to the shrimp toast appetizers, to the chiang mai sausage and duck meatball entrees, to the enormous sundae dessert - most everything hit a high note!The fisherman's stew was pretty salty, and the calamari toast was a bit lacking in calamari. We were very impressed with the rest of the meal, so we'd give those another shot in the future in the hopes that it was an off night.Thanks again for a top notch dining experience!",0
3552,"This is definitely a hole in the wall feel, with a very small special menu. The Yuza beer was awesome and the small tapas was very tasty. Worth a visit if you want to try something different then the mainstream japanese food.Try to book table in advance since it is really small and might not have availability.",0
1172,"Had a great Monday morning brunch here after my friend and I tried to go to Sweet Chick but it wasn't open yet. I'm so glad we ended up at Miriam as it's so much better anyway. We went on MLK Day which a lot of people had off and while it was crowded, we still got a table. My friend got the shukshuka and raved about it. Prices were fine. I had the eggs Benedict and it was so good. And I'm kind of an eggs Benedict snob. :) Coffee was good. Would definitely go back.",0
11734,"Title: A Delightful Surprise at Go Zen

As a recent patron of Go Zen, I was impressed by their ingenious origin story and strategic location, nestled boldly alongside an established vegan competitor in NYC. This clever positioning surely draws in diners like us; my comedy group and I, initially headed elsewhere, refused a two-hour wait next door and found ourselves welcomed by Go Zen's inviting atmosphere.

The interior of Go Zen struck a nostalgic chord with its '90s R&B backdrop, creating a cozy and swanky ambiance that added to our dining experience. But the true highlight was the menu, a successful amalgamation of signature dishes from the former Zen Palate and Gobo. Each dish was an astonishing delight, masterfully mimicking the textures and flavors of meat. The sweet and sour chicken, chicken tenders, and hot wings were unequivocally ""BOMB"" – indistinguishable from their non-vegan counterparts.

While the golden ball pastry fell short of remarkable, the New England rolls deserved a special mention, adding to the overall positive impression of the meal. Go Zen has secured its spot as a ""must dine at"" venue in the city, not only for its food that defies vegan expectations but also for the smart business acumen that gives it a competitive edge. 

Rating: 4.5/5",1
10263,"All they really had to advertise to get me to dine here was say things like, ""We have beef; we have malbec."" This was exactly the experience I was looking for at an Argentinean restaurant, where even the house malbec was delicious (though that sangria at the adjacent table looked great too). Our beef empanadas were among the best I've ever had, with a softer (as opposed to crispy) crust that was still well done. We ordered the Tabla Des Carnes, which is a great way for 2 to sample lots of cuts of beef and sausages at a reasonable price. Everything came with chimichurri, and the entree came with a ramekin of diced tomato in olive oil as well. These add to the complexity of the taste of the beef. Service was very good, though the salad for our entree (we chose that instead of fries) did come out a few minutes after the meat. They offer a free flan for dessert with your Yelp check-in, but it's only available Sunday through Wednesday nights.",0
14667,"A good date night spot on the upper west side.We had the taboon bread with feta,kebab helabi and leila (semolina cake with malabi cream)All of them were tasty and pretty good service.However i felt the entrees were a bit on the pricier side.",0
12282,"The first photo of this Yelp page is not correct. I believe that this is a picture from their other location. I was a bit confused when I first entered this location and the restaurant was more of a to go spot, where there was only 5 seats or so. The food here is very delicious, everything fresh. I got the Ponzu salmon bowl in the medium size. This bowl has Atlantic Salmon, Wasabi Ponzu, Shiso, Avocado, Tobiko. There was a lot of rice at the bottom and I felt like there wasn't as much salmon as I would have liked for the $15 price point.The flavor was very good and I really enjoyed eating it. I feel like this place is a good place to go if you're craving poke and you're around the area. I don't think I would come back because it is just a bit pricey for what is given.",0
14556,"Title: A Gem for Anniversaries and Broadway Goers

Celebrating our four-year anniversary, we returned to the lovely spot where our romance began. The ambiance was perfect for a romantic dinner, complemented by its prime location for theatre enthusiasts.

My partner enjoyed a three-course prix fixe, raving about the freshness of the yellow snapper, while I indulged in the homemade spaghetti with crab meat — a true testament to their scratch-made philosophy. The flavors did not disappoint.

To top off our meal, we were treated to complimentary mini cookies and a hot coffee. Upon sharing the occasion, our observant server went the extra mile to personalize our dessert, adding a star to my review for such thoughtful service.

We're already planning next year's anniversary dinner at this charming restaurant, and perhaps a few visits in between. Highly recommended!",1
17641,"Title: A Kingly Feast: A Review of King Restaurant

After years of anticipation, I finally dined at King, a gem tucked away in the heart of the city, and it did not disappoint. My visit on Columbus Day was graced by perfect weather, enhancing our decision to sit outside, and was influenced by a glowing Yelp review which promised a culinary adventure.

King prides itself on its fine dining approach, stripping back the unnecessary, leaving diners with beautifully simple yet sophisticated dishes. The restaurant's offerings, a marriage of Italian and French cuisines, avoid the pomp of themed establishments, instead providing a sanctuary for true food aficionados.

Upon arrival, the attention to detail was palpable, from the French-made carving knife to the thick, quality paper that listed the daily specials. This meticulous care translated into its cuisine — both entrees we savored could only be the handiwork of a skilled chef, raising the culinary bar far beyond what one could achieve at home. A set number of dishes are prepared daily, ensuring each plate receives the attention it deserves.

The wine selection elevated our meal even further. At around $15 a glass, the offerings were superior to those at a highly praised wine bar we visited later. Unlike other restaurants where I'm hesitant to venture beyond the house wine, King's selection felt newly opened and worth the investment.

However, not everything met these high standards. The dessert, a simple affair of ice cream with espresso, fell short at $15. Its simplicity, albeit enjoyable, was something easily replicated at home for a fraction of the cost, making it the only element of the meal that didn't feel justified in price.

Service was another highlight; it was both excellent and attentive, countering previous reviews I had come across. The holiday lunch meant we weren't rushed and benefited from the staff's undivided attention.

King is a must-visit for those who value the essence of fine dining, minus any pretense. The restaurant’s understated elegance provides a backdrop for food that speaks for itself, and an ambiance that invites you to observe the city's vibrant tapestry. Despite the dessert's negligible misstep, King reigns supreme in my book.",1

12892,"I recently visited this bar with a group of friends for some post-work unwinding and was incredibly impressed by the entire experience. The bar food, especially the mini tacos and sliders, was outstanding and perfect for sharing among our group of seven. Paired with a few drinks, they definitely set the tone for a great night out. The staff deserves a special mention for their accommodating and welcoming attitude; they seated us swiftly and took our order without any delay. Both our food and drinks arrived promptly, and everything was served to perfection. This is an ideal spot for groups looking to kick-start their evening in a pleasant and hospitable atmosphere. Highly recommended!",1
2199,"I'm a huge fan of Spanish food and was really looking forward for this place to open. I came on a Friday night and the place was packed. Walked around and was really looking forward to having some paella but they only had vegetarian and chicken/duck. When it comes to paella I only like seafood so I was super disappointed. Kept walking and decided to try some tapas which were all great. Had pan con tomate, liquid olives, gambas al ajillo, batatas bravas and churros. I have to say everything was excellent except for the churros, they weren't good at all and will skip them next time.They also have a great wine selection which I was super happy about.The prices aren't cheap at all but hey this is NYC so its just part of eating out.",0
12894,"Cute cafe for a casual lunch/dinner! I love the Parisian-style interior, and the staff are so welcoming. For a group of 4, we did the Botanical Therapy (half portions of 3 bowls of choice) with Vegetable Tajine, Tibetan Mama, and Spicy Chili plus the Superseed Avocado. The Tajine had a pickled, tangy kick to it which I liked. I'd recommend the Tibetan Mama as well, especially if you like sweeter curries. The Spicy Vegan Chili was satisfying, but nothing special. Their half portions are definitely on the smaller side, so I'd order the full thing if you're hungry! Otherwise, this was enough for the table. Overall, I wouldn't say the food is to die for, but it's a great option if you're looking for something healthy and nutritious. You can really taste the freshness of their ingredients, making for a light but hearty meal.",0
19277,"Title: Exceptional Burgers and Service at Local Gem

Upon my first visit, the star of the show was undoubtedly the burger. Even as someone who doesn't regularly crave burgers, I was instantly captivated. It was not just good - it was AMAZING. Every component, including the pickles which I typically avoid, melded together to create a burst of flavor that elevated the entire experience.

The pizza, while not entirely to my taste due to a slightly sour profile, clearly boasted high-quality ingredients reminiscent of gourmet-style offerings. It was a well-crafted dish, though perhaps not the ideal choice for my personal palate.

Special commendation is deserved for the general manager, Shannon, whose exceptional service turned a billing error into a display of professionalism and customer care. After being overcharged due to a simple typo, Shannon promptly handled the situation with aplomb, issuing a same-day refund and offering a sincere apology.

Despite a minor hiccup, the experience was overwhelmingly positive. The combination of superb cuisine and top-notch service ensures that I will be a returning customer.",1
3114,"Title: A Love Affair with ICHIRAN Ramen, from Osaka to the Big Apple

I stumbled upon ICHIRAN's blissful ramen in Osaka at an ungodly hour and, let me tell you, it was serendipity at its finest. Their Dotonbori shop, open 24/7, was a lifesaver. Imagine my joy finding the same culinary delight back home in Williamsburg, and now, conveniently in midtown — a stone's throw away from MSG, perfect for a pre-show dinner.

Their ramen is simply magic in a bowl. Going for the medium richness was spot on, leaving me comfortably full for hours of entertainment. A pro tip? Pair it with a side of white rice for the ultimate palette pleaser, especially after a night out. It's like comfort wrapped in a warm hug for your stomach.

It’s about time we get some of those ordering machines stateside, though. They make the whole experience even slicker. Happy feasting indeed, and a big shoutout to ICHIRAN for keeping the ramen dream alive! #yelplife",1
16324,"I hardly ever give any restaurant 5 stars but everything I had here was amazing. We started with the snapper ceviche and it was one of the best ceviches that I've ever had. We then split the spicy honey pizza and mandilli. The pizza had soppressata, a few different cheeses and spicy honey and the flavor combination was perfect. The crust was also perfect. The mandilli is a folded pasta sheet with pesto, ricotta and tomato sauce. The pasta was so thin and the whole dish was amazing. I would definitely come back and recommend.",0
16477,"Title: A Delightful Evening at Bareburger

I recently visited the Bareburger location for the first time with a friend and was immediately impressed by the prompt seating on a busy Friday night. Our server, possibly named Jason, was exceptional—attentive and patient, allowing us to savor our meal without feeling any rush to vacate our table.

The appetizer, sweet potato fries with their signature and truffle aioli sauces, did not disappoint and maintained the high standard I've come to expect from Bareburger. The standout of the night was the Guadalupe burger; a flavorful black bean veggie patty adorned with guacamole, onions, and alfalfa sprouts. As someone who appreciates vegetarian and vegan options, I was thrilled with the dedicated vegan menu and the quality of my meal.

Indulging further, we ordered milkshakes to cap off the night. My chocolate and peanut butter shake was a thick, luxurious treat, perfectly blended and utterly irresistible. After four years of patronizing Bareburger, this location has certainly won me over, ensuring my repeat visits in the future.",1
16794,"My wife and I enjoyed a late dinner at this traditional Korean BBQ spot where the service truly shone. Staff were exceptionally friendly and hands-on, helping to cook and sometimes cut the meat right at the table, which added a nice touch to the authentic experience.

We indulged in the prime level meat selection, sampling short ribs, ribeye, brisket, and more. The assortment of sides like kimchi and mashed potatoes complemented the meats well. As for drinks, my wife was particularly delighted with her Hwayo Sour, a refreshing concoction reminiscent of a pisco sour.

When it comes to rating, I'm torn. The service undoubtedly merits 5 stars, but the food itself, primarily the meats, were excessively fatty for my taste, which brings down the score to 3 stars. So let's settle at 3.5 stars, with a note to future diners: know your preference for fat content and how you like your meat cooked. On a potential next visit, I'd opt for the bulgogi to see if it better suits my palate. Despite the rich cuts of meat not being entirely to my liking, I cannot fault the service which was top-notch.",1
3455,"Very tedious ordering, but in the end I had a delicious gluten free Mexican inspired bowl. The server was fantastic about running back and forth to the kitchen asking questions about what was safe for me to eat. Apparently they marinate their steak in soy sauce and he advised me not to order the rice. I'm not sure if they were right about the rice, but were probably being cautious. They make their rice with Knorr chicken bouillon. Thankfully they have quinoa so nbd if I can't have the rice. Would be great if they would mark the menu since this as far as I know is unusual for Mexican food.Pictured here is the burrito bowl with quinoa, carnitas, a trio of melted cheese, pumpkin seeds, refried beans, and Pico de gallo.",0
16122,"I recently visited this restaurant and tried the pork souvlaki pita ""Greek style"". While the sandwich was tasty, it didn't quite live up to the gyros I savored daily during my time in Greece. This could be a case of my high expectations, but nonetheless, it was a decent eat. Be warned though, the flavors are quite persistent, lingering long after the meal. On the plus side, the service was speedy with a bustling line that moved efficiently, and I appreciated the convenience of nearby steps for a quick outdoor dining experience.",1
12263,"Title: Brunch Bliss with Room for Improvement

I recently decided to try out brunch at this local spot, taking advantage of a Pulsd deal. First impressions didn't disappoint — the restaurant was cute and cozy, maintaining cleanliness and an enjoyable music ambiance. Dining with my mom, we opted for the chicken and waffles, which we found delicious, although the portion could have been more generous. To complement our meal, we also shared shrimp and grits, which were quite satisfying.

The restaurant boasts a charming outdoor seating area at the back, perfect for a sunny brunch setting, and has one clean bathroom. One of the highlights was the variety of mimosa options available. However, a word of caution for those enjoying the bottomless option: post-drinks headache might suggest the alcohol used isn't top-tier.

Overall, the experience was pleasant with decent service and food. It's a nice place I'd consider revisiting but with adjusted expectations on portion sizes and bottomless drink offerings.",1
14310,"Title: A Culinary Revelation at an Ethiopian Gem

As a newcomer to Ethiopian cuisine, I walked into the unnamed restaurant with no expectations and walked out with a new obsession. The meat platter for two was a revelation, every bite bursting with rich, tantalizing flavors that have left me yearning for more. The experience was heightened by the unique and enjoyable tactile element of the meal, encouraging a hands-on approach to dining that truly allows you to 'dig in.' While the ambiance was slightly on the darker side, it takes a backseat when the food served is nothing short of amazing. I only wish this place were closer to home, so I could become a regular.",1
1696,"Title: A Satisfying, Flavorful Experience at [Restaurant Name]

My recent visit to [Restaurant Name] was a delightful culinary journey that exceeded almost all expectations, landing at a solid 4.5 stars. Service was a standout with attentive and knowledgeable servers who guided us through the menu's highlights with expertise.

We embraced the communal dining spirit, sharing several dishes while indulging in our own. The Roast Duck, with its perfect portion for sharing and non-greasy, well-cooked meat, was a hit despite the skin's lack of crispiness. Meanwhile, the Salted Egg Fish Fillet stole the show with its hot, crispy batter and richly satisfying salted duck egg yolk sauce; a dish I'd eagerly reorder.

The Crab Soup Dumplings presented a wonderful flavor balance with the right meatiness, though a touch more soup would've been the cherry on top. Our dining experience was sweetly rounded off with a complimentary Sticky Rice Pudding from a YELP Check-in – a pleasant dessert that wasn't too sweet, though it was a bit heavy on the stomach.

I eagerly anticipate my next visit to [Restaurant Name] to dive into more of their signature offerings.",1
11986,"Chicken is so yummy and so crispy.  I got to say the is the best Mac and cheese and collard greens in Harlem. The owner was there he is very sweet and you can taste the love in the food. Also the cornbread was sooo good, moist and flavorful.",0

Just like at the real thing, do not expect regular tables and chairs: it is stand up eating (there are long bars where you can place your plates and beverages).I really felt transported back to my hometown Ensenada, the decoration, aromas and flavors are truly a reflection of the real deal.If you like tacos, this place must definitely be on your list.",0

17053,"Ruby's is literally one of my most favorite restaurants in the city and I'm SO happy to see their new location opened in Union Square. This one is so much more spacious than the one in Soho and Murray Hill. Just like these two locations, this spot also doesn't take reservation though. I came on a Saturday night around 7pm and got seated right away at the bar table. Otherwise, we would've had to wait for 30 min. Per usual, I ordered the love of my life bronte burger (must try) and my bf got shrimp pasta (very good option for pasta-- or ragu pasta is also very delicious!). They got my order wrong and instead gave me the Bondi burger. But they just gave it to me on the house and later came out with the right order, which was very nice! I've never tried any burgers on the menu other than the bronte burger, but I was pleasantly surprised at how delicious it was. It's so saucy and has a spicy kick to it, so if you're into that you would love this burger!",0

My pizza had something to be desired... a margherita pizza has always come with tomatoes and plenty of basil, and mine had neither. Someone else in our group help the same and ordered more in the side. Prices were okay (between $12-15 per pizza and small enough that each person should order their own). I wasn't totally wow-ed by this place, especially because it had come so highly recommended. We were also a bit bamboozled by the entrance, because you have to walk DOWN stairs into it from the street (but it was neat regardless). A couple of blocks from Times Square, not far from Rock Center and Central Park so the location is pretty key if you don't want to venture too far away. But, be assured, Little Italy is a 15 minute train ride away and would certainly offer higher quality stuff.",0

11570,"Title: A Park Avenue Gem - Hillstone Surprises

Walking into Hillstone Park Ave South, you may carry the usual skepticism reserved for chain restaurants, but this place shatters those reservations. For years now, it's been my reliable pick for both exceptional food and impeccable service.

The Thai Steak Noodle Salad is a personal favorite, a vibrant and fresh dish that satisfies without weighing you down. For the carnivores, the Campfire Barbecue Pork Ribs are a must-try – so tender they practically melt off the bone.

Burger enthusiasts will find themselves in a delicious dilemma here, torn between the Hillstone and the Upland burgers. Having tried both, my loyalty remains firmly with Hillstone's savory creation. If you venture into their sushi options, you'll find Americanized but tasty rolls – though truthfully, they could drop the 'sushi' label to manage expectations.

The one shortfall of this dining experience is the string fries, which sadly miss the mark. They're often greasy, tough, and underwhelming, a surprising misstep in an otherwise stellar menu.

Price-wise, Hillstone is on the higher end, but rest assured, it's a worthy indulgence. The environment strikes a perfect balance between upscale and relaxed, making it a standout on Park Avenue. The level of professionalism from the staff matches, if not exceeds, some of the finest establishments, including Park Avenue itself. 

Hillstone has mastered the art of chain dining with an independent restaurant's heart. Despite the steep competition, it remains a top recommendation for a fabulous meal in a comfortable yet refined setting.",1

Upon entering the spacious, dual-roomed eatery with a ravenous appetite, I was immediately drawn to the counter showcasing an array of specialty pizza slices. It was the Nonna Maria that commanded my attention – a classic harmony of fresh mozzarella, basil, and tomato sauce.

Minutes later, seated with a warm slice in hand, each bite was a comforting embrace of soft dough and sumptuous, melting cheese. The aromas of olive oil and basil danced in the air, enhancing the experience. Sadly, the slice was devoured all too quickly, but it left a lasting impression as one of the finest I've enjoyed in New York City. A must-visit for any serious pizza aficionado.",1
2090,I used to come here for lunch all the time at my old job but haven't come back since they moved across the street and upgraded the place.  The decor is more modern and sleek.  The space is much larger and there's more seating.  I ordered my usual order: chicken thigh over brown rice and salad with carrot ginger dressing.  The portion was larger than I remembered.  I like that it came in a ceramic bowl instead of a cardboard box like they used to do for dining in.  The chicken thigh had a good char and the ingredients were fresh.  The staff were a bit rude and not too friendly.  I was standing there waiting to order and no one acknowledged me whatsoever.  I would come back if I'm ever in the area but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here.,0
2382,"Title: Unmet Expectations at a Trendy Ramen Spot

I came to this restaurant with high hopes after seeing its glowing reviews, eager to try their unique bone marrow ramen. Unfortunately, the novelty couldn't make up for the lackluster flavors. The noodles lacked the richness I anticipated, and the broth failed to impress. The beef that accompanied the dish was disappointingly dry and bland, leaving much to be desired. With a sparse scattering of other ingredients, I found myself needing to add extras just to enhance the meal.

We also ordered the spicy tantan ramen, which was unremarkable at best. To add to the underwhelming dining experience, the service was less than stellar. Our waitress appeared to be in a constant rush, despite the restaurant not being busy, which made our meal feel hurried and uncomfortable.

Overall, this restaurant seems to bank more on its innovative ideas than on executing the fundamental elements of a satisfying ramen experience. Sadly, I cannot recommend it based on this visit.",1
15663,"Title: Savory Bargain Ramen Experience

I recently visited a no-frills ramen spot that offers pretty impressive bowls for the price. The restaurant boasts a convenient order-at-the-stand system, allowing diners to choose their meal before finding a seat.

I first dropped in just after Halloween last year, armed with a coupon for a complimentary bowl. Interestingly, the staff never collected my coupon, permitting me to enjoy several free bowls before they realized the oversight.

Out of all the options, the chicken ramen stood out as my top pick. However, it's worth noting that the broths here lean towards the saltier side. If you're after a hearty, flavorful ramen that's easy on the pocket, this place is worth a visit—just don't expect your coupon to last forever!",1
16197,"Tucked in the heart of the Lower East Side, this charming spot resonates with downtown cool and has owners who bring a welcome, youthful vibe to the restaurant scene. Unfortunately, my visit was marred by a fundamental misstep - the classic French fry. Lacking the essential crispy exterior and a punch of seasoning, the fries didn't quite hit the mark. That said, their adventurous array of toppings partially redeemed the experience. The Drunk Guy and Mac N Cheese fry options stood out, both indulgent and satisfying. The Pulled Pork fry, however, didn't meet expectations. On a brighter note, the Tater Tots were excellent, and the Curly Fries consistently delivered. In essence, it's the go-to for hearty, comfort food cravings after a night out, serving until the wee hours of 4am.",1
12252,I feel like the chicken is either precooked or perhaps over cooked/charred because it comes off as a little bit dry.  The salad with carrot ginger dressing was really good. Also got some dumplings which were okay since they are deep fried.  The sauce on the dumplings was great since it had a lot of acidity and tartness.,0
19995,"Title: A Sizzling Korean BBQ Experience Worth the Wait

I recently had my first foray into Korean BBQ at this bustling hotspot and was left enamored by the culinary adventure. Opting for the USDA beef, I was treated to meat that was marinated to perfection, boasting flavors that far surpass your standard fare, cooked to absolute perfection without a hint of unwanted fat. 

Sides like the slippery clear noodles and the savory kimchi pancake complemented the main course beautifully. Be warned - popularity comes with a price; a wait time of over an hour on a Saturday and 40 minutes on a Thursday is testament to the quality on offer.

One minor quibble was the subpar smoke ventilation, which left a smoky souvenir in our hair – though, curiously, this was only noticeable on one of my two visits. Nevertheless, this should not deter you. With its delightful food and amiable staff, I heartily recommend a visit to anyone craving an authentic Korean BBQ experience.",1

The portion was generous and I probably could have eaten this for my meal if I hadn't been sharing. We also had the goulash, the veal schnitzel, and the pork knuckle!! The pork knuckle was the most fun to eat, between cutting and shredding and all the dipping sauces. Lingonberry was my favorite sauce. I also really enjoyed the crunchy delicious veal. It was so crunchy it almost hurt the roof of my mouth but I couldn't stop eating it anyway! Service was also really great. Our waitress was so friendly and the owner even came out to meet us and make sure everything turned out well. Their brunch looks great too and I hope to come back for that!

We hadn't visited for months and we were kind of disappointed today. We ordered the large beef combo for 4 people and the portion was good enough to share, 3 different meats with one beef brisket soybean paste stew. However, the quality of meat wasn't as great as what we expected and even worse then AYCE Korea BBQ place. The beef brisket was super dry and overcooked, the prime boneless short rib was braised too salty and greasy. Their sides were decent and as great add-on especially my favorites: steamed egg and cheese corn. As I mentioned in the beginning, there are lots of new options recently opening around Korea town so we won't come back shortly.",0

19133,"Title: My Happy Hour Haven with a Thai Twist

I'm always thrilled to share about this gem of a spot for happy hour enthusiasts like myself! This place sets the bar high with their daily happy hour offerings, including weekends until 8 pm—a rare find in the city. What's more, they serve unbeatable pitchers of mojitos and margaritas at great prices, and they're never stingy with the alcohol.

The food is another highlight. Thai cuisine at very reasonable prices, and the quality is top-notch. I recently savored the Tofu Kee Mao for $14, and it was absolutely delightful with generous portions that guarantee you won't leave hungry.

A word to the wise, though: it's a popular establishment, so reservations are recommended for large groups (they accommodate five or more). While space can be snug for bigger parties, I had a birthday celebration here and the staff were incredibly helpful.

Lastly, its location is perfect for those looking to continue their night with some bar hopping. This place firmly holds its spot as a top choice for a fulfilling dinner and a smooth transition to nighttime fun.",1
2743,"Visiting in town with a friend that lives near by this restaurant. She tells me she always take visitors here and she made an excellent choice. Plenty of indoor seating for couples to groups with bar up front.The interior is a lovely shade of blue and smartly decorated. Clean and modern lines. Inviting as you look inside. Come on it, you will not be disappointed.Spaghetti Bolognese was delicious. While not actually on the menu, they were more than happy to provide to me.We were checked in on my the staff regularly. The lighting was good. As it got dark outside, they reduced the overhead lights by a lot so quickly we were surprised. We mentioned a few times it was far too dark saying jokingly that we were ""not dating"". We all laughed and they adjusted to be a little less dark.",0
20092,"Title: A Unique Culinary Delight Away from the Norm

From the moment we walked in, it was clear this wasn't your average chain dining experience. Dinner at this gem turned into an interactive culinary adventure, much to the delight of everyone at the table, especially the kids who were too fascinated with grilling their own food to even glance at their phones.

We indulged in the graduation special, a smorgasbord of premium meats including the standout Yaki Shabu beef, succulent filet mignon, and rich short rib. Each slice was seasoned to perfection, cut paper-thin, ensuring a swift sizzle to savory goodness on the grill. The vegetables we tossed on the grill complemented the meats brilliantly, making them an instant favorite.

While the bimbimbap deviated from the traditional, leaning towards a fried rice interpretation, it was tasty though unexpected.

One piece of advice: make a reservation. This place is bustling, and you won't want to miss out on the fun and flavor that await here.",1
20878,"Title: A Margarita Haven with a Side of Energy

My visit to this spot was prompted by the rave reviews of their house strawberry margaritas, and let me tell you, they did not disappoint. Those refreshing drinks truly are the stars here; they're perfectly blended and slide down a treat. Pair that with the tinga burrito I tried – a decent choice, if not particularly memorable – and you've got yourself a satisfying meal.

The place pulses with a vibrant Mexican vibe, making it an excellent venue for an hour or two of lively socializing. On the night we dropped by, the crowd was loud and spirited, providing just the right backdrop for our group's animated conversations. If you're looking to blend into a fun crowd and sip on superb margaritas, this is the spot for you.",1
20344,"During my recent visit to a Chinese restaurant catering predominantly to a foreign clientele, the dining experience fell short of expectations on authenticity and value. A high point was the pork rib, which delivered with its meaty texture and a pleasing glaze of sweet sauce. However, the Shredded Beef with Bean Curb was a letdown: its lack of authenticity was evident in its oddly mushy texture and overdone sauce. The Roasted Duck Bun also disappointed, with its meager filling overshadowed by the excessively thick bun. The Fish Filet in Green Pepper Sauce, despite being recommended by our waitress, proved to be a regrettable choice for $27, offering scant fish and a lackluster, lukewarm sauce. The Stir Fry Green Bean, though competently prepared, was not immune to the restaurant's overall trend of steep pricing at $16. In summary, this Upper East Side establishment delivered a mediocre experience with dishes that did not justify their premium prices, especially for those in search of genuine Chinese cuisine.",1

14756,"TLDR: Excellent high-end sushi bar. Impeccable service, Chef Kousaka will deliver you a tasting menu that you will remember and be yearning to come back for more. If you're considering splurging for an omakase, you cannot go wrong.I'm really shocked that I hadn't written this review earlier, especially because this was one of the most memorable meals I had last year. With my experience, the omakase meals that I didn't plan (no special occasion) and decided to go rather haphazardly - turn out to be the best. For me at least.Memorial Day weekend, we decided after work to come back into the city and give Kosaka a shot. We were able to snag a seat with Chef around 9. When we first walked in, I was taken away by the interior design. I just love love love the way this restaurant looks. It's chic, sexy, minimalistic and feels so inviting. You're a relatively close distance to Chef so it's nice to be able to watch him bring each piece together.The service here is superb. Attentive staff, mindful of the little things and that balance of being there when you need them but not hovering over you either.Kosaka has rightfully earned a Michelin star since we last dined. I haven't been able to make it back since but this is a meal that I think of quite frequently. There is also an a la carte ""Aburi"" sushi you can order. I am a total sucker for torched sushi, so the fact that I can have a plate of all torched nigiri - yasssssss.The kama toro he served which is from the collar of the tuna, was just phenomenal. He was fun to converse with too. The discipline he shows and his attention to detail was very memorable. While assembling one add-on piece we ordered, it wasn't quite staying together. You could sense his frustration and he scrapped the whole piece to make sure he delivered it the way he wanted to.I love this place and I know you will too. So if you've been looking through a list of different omakase restaurants to plan that meal, I can tell you this is the right one.",0
14443,"Dined at The Black Ant last weekend for a birthday brunch. The establishment was able to accommodate 16 people with multiple tables pushed together to form a long row. We were seated in the brightly lit patio in the back of the restaurant - so glad we got to dine out there as opposed to the darker alternative in the indoor parts of the restaurant. Really changed up the mood of the placeFOOD:For brunch, I ordered the Steak Rancheros. There were maybe 3 small pieces of steak in there - they weren't too impressive or tasty. Even though there wasn't that much food, I wasn't really feeling the dish, and gave the rest of it away to be finished. Many other people who ordered the Steak Rancheros were still left hungry, so they stepped out for a bit in search of pizza or takoyaki to supplement their meal. The birthday girl ordered the Black Ant Burger - she was able to replace the beef patty with chicken instead, as she doesn't eat beef. The burger buns were black, but same taste as a regular bun (it was only black food coloring or something). My friend said the burger was good but nothing too special. Another guy ordered an omelet for brunch - it was just a regular omelet, looked small and unspectacular. Our food took a really long time to arrive, but he got his meal last out of the 16 of us haha even though it prob takes the shortest amount of time to cook an omelet.DRINKS:From the brunch drinks menu, you're able to choose from a mimosa, bloody maria, traditional margarita, and smoky jalapeno margarita. You have the option of adding flavor to each drink for $1 (flavors include cucumber, mango, passionfruit, and prickly pear). The drinks were strong & the favorite one of the table seemed to be the mango margarita. TL;DRAll in all, the food at The Black Ant was very meh imo. Waited a while for our water cups to be refilled. The drinks and dishes could've came out a bit faster. The waiters were nice, no complaints there. I liked the atmosphere of the patio section of the establishment though!",0
18449,"I recently visited a local restaurant whose culinary offerings were definitely impressive. The Hainanese Chicken was notably smooth, flavorful, and perfectly cooked. The Wok Wok Curry Beef Stew Claypot delighted with its rich, well-spiced sauce. The Seafood Pineapple Fried Rice added a tropical twist to the meal, while the Popcorn Chicken was irresistibly tasty - a must-try item on the menu! My personal favorite, the Four of a Kind Belacan, was a standout with its bold flavors.

Service was attentive and efficient, making the dining experience quite pleasant. An added bonus for Yelp users is a complimentary small Thai Iced Tea when you check in, a sweet perk to the meal.

However, the establishment was let down by its restroom facilities, which were in a dire state and could only be described as traumatizing. A visit there was enough to mar an otherwise enjoyable experience. I urge the management to invest in renovating the restrooms, as it would greatly enhance the overall appeal of the restaurant and ensure that it's not just the food that leaves a lasting, positive impression on the patrons.",1
19381,"Decent brunch place near Herald Square. This was one of the first brunch options that popped up while I was Yelping for a spot nearby. I came on a Friday around 11am. Our table of 3 was seated within 10 minutes. The hostess told us the Yelp waitlist is reserved only for brunch weekends.I opted for the Nova Benny as I am a HUGE fan of egg benedicts. My fiancé got the fried chicken sandwich while my friend got the chicken chilaquiles. The food came out pretty quick. Overall, it was good but definitely not memorable. I've had better egg benedicts before. The prices were on par with city prices but I probably wouldn't go out of my way to come back.",0
1087,"Title: A Delightful Find - Angela's Sandwich Shop

My latest food adventure led me to Angela's Sandwich Shop, a delightful non-chain establishment perfect for a quick bite. Tucked conveniently in the heart of the city, Angela's offers an array of tasty lunch options at affordable prices.

Service here is notably fast and efficient, a real treat for those in a hurry. I indulged in the California Turkey Wrap, which was nothing short of delicious. The wrap boasted a generous serving of fresh avocado and a tangy honey mustard that tied the flavors together beautifully.

While the drink selection was limited to standard bottled options, it didn't overshadow the quality of the meal. Although there's just one restroom requiring a key from the counter, the seating arrangement is quite comfortable and accommodating.

Overall, Angela's Sandwich Shop is a fantastic spot for a satisfying and wallet-friendly meal, with a personal touch that sets it apart from your average eatery. Highly recommended for a quick and tasty lunch!",1

14808,"My 600th review! I've been meaning to come here for a long time and finally found myself here for lunch one day. I made a reservation for 2 the day before and since it was just for lunch, we had no problem doing so. We arrived around 1pm and were seated right away.Upon sitting, our waiter asked ""sparkling or still water?"" We said still. Minutes later, he comes back out with an 800mL bottle of Voss Still Water. What we didn't know is that water isn't included in your order like it is almost everywhere else in NYC. This bottle of water cost ~$9. Not the biggest deal but it would be nice to know that we would be charged for it, because our meals already came with a drink so we didn't even need the water in the first place.For our meals, I got from the ""secret"" Lunch Special Menu which includes the Nusret Burger, fries, a drink, and a slice of Baklava for ~$27. That is a STEAL considering the burger alone is usually ~$30!After 15-20 minutes, our orders were ready. The presentation is beautiful and the wooden board really makes the aesthetic. I also liked the #saltbae toothpicks that kept the burger halves together.The Nusret Burger was great! The beef is super tender and the caramelized onions and cheese enhance the flavor. The french fries were perfect! I read so many mixed reviews on the fries and how they were making many changes to them, but honestly, if this is how they will be from now on, they're solid!After the burger and fries, I was pretty full but there's always room for dessert! For dessert, they brought out their Authentic Pistachio Baklava with Maras Ice Cream. It was absolutely delicious! The ice cream was super creamy and the baklava was flaky, sweet, and the right balance between soft and crunchy.Overall, the meal was delicious and the ambiance was great! The water issue was the only turn off since it was just surprising when the bill came. But now I know for next time. I would definitely come back and it would most likely be for their steaks!",0
10013,"Title: A Late-Night Gem for Korean BBQ Lovers

I recently enjoyed another visit to one of my favorite late-night spots, and I must say, this experience topped them all. Arriving around 2 a.m., we were greeted by an incredibly kind and patient server who took the time to explain the banchan dishes to us, even bringing extra portions of my beloved fish cakes. 

The Korean BBQ, cooked right at our table over sizzling coals, was sublime. Although the meat items were a bit on the pricey side, there were plenty of other affordable options on the menu. Our total bill came to about $170 before tip (over $200 with gratuity), but considering we had an abundance of food to take home, it was well worth it. The soju mixed drink was the perfect accompaniment to our meal.

All staff members we interacted with were friendly and the atmosphere, even in the wee hours, was welcoming. This place is a solid choice for anyone in NYC looking for a delicious and different late-night dining experience.",1
1965,"I recently had the pleasure of dining at this local spot, and I can wholeheartedly say the experience was splendid. The homemade noodles and dumplings delighted with their authenticity, each bite a testament to skilled craftsmanship. A must-try is the hot pot bowl – a warming concoction that captured the essence of comfort food, and the soup dumplings were a deliciously soupy marvel, each one bursting with flavor.

Our server, Jin, elevated the dining experience with his outstanding service. He was attentive and intuitive, surprising my son with a birthday dessert, a thoughtful gesture that added a personal touch to our meal. It's rare to find someone who pays such close attention to their patrons.

My only suggestion to the establishment would be to offer skewers throughout the day to broaden the delectable choices for patrons at any time. Nonetheless, this restaurant is a gastronomic gem, and I recommend it highly for anyone in search of top-notch food and service.",1
13801,"Title: A Culinary Gem Exceeding High Expectations

From the moment I stepped into Wayan, my high expectations were not only met but exceeded. The restaurant presents an authentic Indonesian flavor profile with an innovative twist that tantalizes the taste buds. The open kitchen design added to the immersive dining experience, allowing us to watch in anticipation as each delectable dish was prepared.

Perched next to the service counter, I could witness the culinary magic unfold, each dish appearing more appetizing than the last. It's a feast for the eyes as much as for the palate, ensuring our appetites were well and truly piqued.

Even if you're not normally enticed by sweets, make an exception for Wayan's desserts—they're an unmissable finale to an exquisite dining experience. Moreover, the hospitality is unparalleled; the staff's knowledge, warmth, and friendliness are top-notch, making every guest feel like a VIP.

To fully savor the Wayan experience, I recommend making a reservation, rounding up a group of friends, and trying a broad array of dishes. It's a decision you'll look back on with zero regrets.",1
2749,"A French surname for a Chinese cafe? It is clearly Asian Fusion that targets the American palette.  Located outside the peripheral areas of Chinatown, this is in Harlem where I was en route home bound which enable me for a visit.  I am not afraid of traveling near or far to enjoy good quality food.  Asian Fusion is not my take as I prefer traditional authentic for a very old school approach because food looses its flavor, meaning, taste, seasoning, original ingredients, cultural origins, and significance in the conversion to modernization of Asian Fusion similar to language when translated from its original text to English.  Lost in conversion or lost in translation.  Lacquer chopsticks are provided in sustaining with authentic Asian cuisine dinning utensils.  Ambiance is modern with high ceiling and wall is adorned with black and white photos of pre-war Shanghai.  There is a bowl of Asian candy mints available for distribution at meal's end by the cashier/host table.  Excessively overpriced for outside peripheral areas of Chinatown.  All Chinese dumplings are 6 pieces per order as stated on their menu.  Customer service is efficient and attentive who speak fluent English.  I was able to keep my bill.  Order fulfillment is efficient without waiting an eternity.  Aside from overpriced, my experience was positive.  Facilities are also modern Asian influence and relatively clean.  The bottom of the bill embeds ""suggested tip"" of 15%, 18% and 20% ergo patrons do not have to calculate the arithmetic sequence.My foodie synopsis:Shanghainese soup dumplings 小籠包 xiao long bao (siu2 lung4 baau1) - 6 pcs, $9.95Somewhat juicy and served piping hot.  Average.Shrimp dumplings 蝦 餃 (haa1 gaau2) - 6 pcs, $9.50Fresh and a delight.  These haa1 gaau2 appears non-traditional as it contain vegetable chives.",0

For the amount I got, I think the price should have been $13 or so but it is what it is. The food is a hit or miss. The rice with the beans and the jerk chicken were amazing. Id definitely get those again. The fried chicken wasnt that fresh but after, I bought the fried chicken again and it was MUCH better.I did not like the collard greens or the bbq chicken.

269,"I've been curious how this place was gonna be, it just opened up. The way it works is you go up, select what kind of pasta you want, they cut it in front of you there. After that you select your sauce and toppings. It's kind of like dig inn but for pasta. That being said, i'll give a breakdown.The pasta: The pasta was nice and al dente. It had good flavor. I went with fettucini. They cut it right there in front of me.The sauce: i went with the marinara, the person i'm guessing is the owner had a good attitude and seemed passionate about the food. The sauce itself had a very strong acidity flavor, not very sweet, i think it could have used a touch more sugar. But other than that, it was pretty good and better than some of the nearby places.The service: being that the place just opened, there was not alot of foot traffic. The staff was pretty nice. The cutting of the pasta i think is a great idea and a good niche, however If the place becomes popular i can easily see it will cause lines to be very very long and have trouble scaling. Other: Their choices of addins/ i found a little odd, they have meatballs which is normal and bacon bites which would go ok with a carbonara. However, they had roast chicken, but no sausage? I've never had or would even associate roast chicken with pasta. Imo they should either add sausage also, or replace chicken with sausage. Price: fettucini with tomato sauce came out to be about $10. Not bad.Overall: i'll be back, the place is definitely good.",0
12806,"**Sugar East Cocktail Experience**

Visited Sugar East for a post-dinner cocktail on a Sunday evening. This Upper East Side basement bar boasts a stylish ambiance with its candle-lit decor and a chic entryway, making it an attractive spot for a nightcap. However, the experience was marred by a few downsides.

**Ambiance:** The bar had some cool design elements, including a large screen playing ""Pulp Fiction,"" but the overall atmosphere was let down by a noticeable smell of smoke and uncomfortably warm temperatures.

**Drinks:** The cocktail menu, while creative, failed to impress. Both the Strawberry (a blend of tequila, liqueur, lemon, Champagne, and rose water) and the Toasted Sesame (gin with sesame, rice milk, cinnamon, and lemon) were merely average. The offerings did not inspire a desire for a second round, especially considering the serving size felt scant for the price point.

**Value:** Priced at $16-$18, these cocktails seemed steep, especially given their modest volume.

**Service:** The service was efficient, with the bartender eager to offer happy hour deals as the window was closing—a small silver lining to the visit.

**Crowd:** The bar wasn't bustling, with just a small group present.

**Parking:** A challenge, as expected in this part of Manhattan.

In conclusion, despite its cool aesthetic and prompt service, the negatives of Sugar East—from the subpar cocktails to the smoky and stifling environment—contributed to a less-than-ideal experience, prompting an early departure.",1

16207,"Title: Beware: Overcharging and Refusal to Refund

I'm compelled to share a forewarning to anyone considering visiting City Sandwich: Avoid this establishment due to dishonest practices. Initially enticed by promising reviews and appetizing menu prices displayed outside, we faced our first letdown when the indoor prices were incongruously higher. However, the real issue arose at checkout, where we were overcharged beyond even the indoor prices.

The situation escalated when the owner refused to rectify the overcharge, despite the cashier managing to adjust the bill for another couple with the same complaint. This refusal speaks volumes about the owner's lack of customer service and integrity.

The restaurant itself was desolately empty, which in hindsight, feels like an unheeded warning sign. Culinary-wise, the sandwiches were unremarkable and overpriced, failing to justify their $15-16 price point. The upcharge for ""free-range chicken"" only added insult to injury, as it bore an uncanny resemblance to sub-par gas station fare.

A colleague, who is a catering professional, was equally appalled and has vowed to cease business with City Sandwich. This experience has unequivocally damaged their reputation within the local corporate community.

Be warned and steer clear of City Sandwich, where overcharging and poor customer service are apparently part of the menu.",1

Don't let Pomodoro's unassuming exterior dissuade you; this no-frills Italian eatery is a favorite among locals who often opt for delivery to savor the comfort of home-cooked-style meals.

On the occasion you dine in, the service is notably attentive, enhancing the experience. Prices are easy on the purse strings, with hearty pasta dishes ranging from $10-$15 and light selections like soups and salads from $5-$8.

The dining experience begins with a warm welcome of complimentary bread and butter, with classic condiments on the side. It's a simple yet appreciated gesture.

Standout dishes include the classic Spaghettini & Meatballs and the sumptuous Spaghettini alle Vongole, bursting with seafood in a rich marinara. The Caesar Salad is an absolute must-try and can be boosted with protein for a modest additional cost.

While the soups of the day are always tempting, my staple combination of pasta and Caesar salad is enough to satisfy without venturing into 'too much' territory.

Pomodoro may appear humble, but it's the quality, affordability, and service that will have you returning time and again.",1
11520,"Title: Cozy Evening with Fresh Pasta and Good Vibes

I recently visited this bustling spot at 6:30 pm with four friends to see if it lived up to the hype. The restaurant was quickly filling, setting the scene for a lively evening. We took advantage of the happy hour, selecting two bottles of wine at a special price.

To start, we shared the Pizza d'Abruzzo, a novel yet interesting dish featuring beans, which was good for a try but not a favorite. My main course, the Pappardelle al Pollo, stood out with its unmistakable freshness and the perfect chewiness of the noodles.

When it came to celebrating a birthday, this eatery had a sweet albeit simple workaround — a candle-lit dessert accompanied by a birthday song. The tiramisu was pleasant, with a subtle coffee flavor, while the seasonal pumpkin cheesecake stole the show with its creamy texture and prominent pumpkin flavor.

Prices were fair, especially for fresh pasta in the city, with mains ranging from $14 to $25. The staff's friendliness and attentiveness added to the positive experience. I recommend this place for anyone looking for a relaxed atmosphere, friendly service, and especially for fresh pasta enthusiasts.",1

Bad choice because the man/boy next to me had no regard for anyone other than himself. Talked loud. Cursed. Coughed in my direction with no mouth coverage. (Who does that after age 8?) Did I say curses with the F word about every 3rd word as if to impress, along with regaling the girls he was with of his workout routine so loudly I could've repeated it. Anyway...the food. The entire menu had so many yummy options that I again turned to my bartender for help. She steered me to the sandwich of eggs, bacon, cheese and a sauce that was to die for. The sandwich turned out to be HUGE and cut into 4ths that I took home half. So sad! The Bloody Mary was spicy - and as I drank it I was wishing I would've ordered some of the more interesting cocktails because watching theart of the pour was fascinating! They have some really cool toppers, also! Funny how I can pick a drink based on that - kinda like I pick a horse at the track based on the jockeys colors!?!?

3577,"Title: A Taste of Taiwan in the Heart of Manhattan

As someone who grew up surrounded by a vibrant Taiwanese community, finding authentic Taiwanese fare in Manhattan felt like a quest of epic proportions—until I discovered this gem. I loved it so much that I introduced my family and friends to it on several occasions.

This snug little restaurant transports you straight to Taiwan with its mouth-watering brunch offerings like the freshly made Egg Pancake, which strikes the perfect balance between egg and dough without being overly seasoned, although it's a tad small for sharing. The Rice Roll with Crueller and Pickled Vegetables is impeccable, boasting an ideal mix of ingredients without falling apart. The freshly cooked Turnip Cake avoids common pitfalls—it’s neither undercooked nor over-seasoned and comes perfectly fried. The Salty Soymilk is an acquired taste, featuring a pleasant salt-to-vinegar balance and crispy crueller morsels that are a delightful treat, although a little pickled vegetable could enhance it further.

Dinner is just as impressive. The Braised Beef Noodle Soup has a delicious flavor profile that isn’t too salty, and even though the soup could benefit from a longer braise, it’s gratifying. The Lu Rou Fan is masterfully made—surprisingly non-greasy, perfectly seasoned, and the rice-to-sauce ratio is spot on. Though, I wouldn’t mind a larger serving! The Pickled Cucumbers provide a refreshing contrast to the meat dishes, capturing the essence of the cucumber’s crispness without over-marination.

In a nutshell, this establishment is a slice of Taiwanese heaven, well worth any potential wait due to its popularity. For anyone craving Taiwanese comfort food in Manhattan, this is the place to be. I'll certainly be back for more.",1

We ordered the gyoza and the fried chicken as an appetizer and it was brought out pretty quickly. Both were warm and delicious. For my meal I ordered the chili chicken ramen, and so did two of my coworkers, while one of them ordered the spicy miso ramen. The food did not take very long to come out. The ramen was so flavorful and yummy with the perfect amount of spice. The broth was so delicious that after I finished the noodles I wanted to drink the whole thing but was too full to do so. So yeah, the food was a great portion for the price and was definitely made with love. We also had the lychee mojito which was also tasty. I am definitely going to return again and again!",0
1327,"I recently visited this charming spot taking advantage of a Pulsd dinner deal for two, and it exceeded all expectations. The deal was generous, including six drinks that ranged from bourbon to rosé, and even a dessert drink for each of us. The food was a delightful spread of Southern classics: the deviled eggs and biscuits set the stage for a mouth-watering main of chicken & waffles and creamy mac n cheese, alongside fresh veggies. Dessert didn't disappoint—with both pecan and key lime pies rounding off the meal superbly. The portions were so ample we happily left with leftovers.

Adding to the pleasant experience was the friendly and attentive service, notably from our charming waiter, who, along with the rest of the staff, ensured our dining experience was a delight from start to finish. I'll certainly be back for the delicious food and warm hospitality.",1
17757,"THE BEST KIMCHI STEW I HAVE EVER HAD AT A RESTAURANT (and I've had a lot...) Just a side note, Kimchi STEW and Kimchi SOUP are different so don't expect the more watery/soup version here. Yoon Haeundae Galbi offers Kimchi Stew. The Marinated Galbi, side dishes (very traditional and healthy), and service were also awesome.I came in around 2pm (Wednesday) and it was pretty calm. I'm guessing around 12-1pm it gets super busy. The interior is very spacious (2 floors), clean, and modern.I knew what I wanted so I ordered the Lunch Set Menu as soon as I sat down- the Marinated Short Ribs with Kimchi Stew ($23 before tax/tip). This was a pretty good deal considering Marinated Short Ribs at Korean restaurants are pretty pricey by itself ($20ish+). The meat was a perfect portion for me, but I could see it being not enough food for someone who was hungrier/has a bigger appetite.Do yourself a favor and come here for the Lunch Set! I will definitely be back to try their KBBQ for dinner, which will hopefully be just as good.",0
19158,"Restaurant Review: Ise

Ambiance:
Upon walking into Ise on a busy Saturday noon, the first impression is of a cozy, L-shaped space with a homey blend of light and dark wood decor. The layout, initially presenting a narrow hallway leading to the bar, then opening up to booths and tables, could feel a bit claustrophobic due to the wooden fence-like front window treatment, which gives off a cramped vibe.

Service:
Reservations the night before were not successful due to unclear reasons, but we were offered bar seating upon arrival—a comfortable alternative with wide seats and supportive backing.

Cuisine:
The soba selection is a highlight, with seasonal options that outshine the regular menu. I chose the gyu soba—a beef and mushroom hotpot with sweet, soupy sauce complemented by a zesty yuzu spice. While the saucepot's cozy touch was marred by the flame extinguishing too quickly, leaving the contents to cool down rapidly, the dish was flavorful with generously thick cuts of onion and sufficient beef. My companion's kakiage cha soba was less impressive due to overly oily tempura and inconsistent batter crunchiness, though the seasoned batter was a plus.

Value:
Comparatively, my beef soba was reasonably priced and offered more side ingredients, making it a better value than the shrimp tempura soba.

Miscellaneous:
A minor challenge was the clumping of soba noodles, which defied graceful consumption. The meal ended pleasantly with a serving of hot, strong tea—a small touch that was much appreciated.

Overall, Ise is a restaurant I look forward to exploring further, despite some areas for improvement.",1
17467,"If you're looking for some old school Italian vibes with great food and strong drinks - this is your place! I came here with my parents and fiancé on a Sunday night for dinner and we had such a great meal and overall experience. It's a casual place but you can easily dress up and fit right in. We started off with their bread and butter and ordered the Frutta di Mare - this was a huge hit. For entrees we had Chicken Parm, Penne Vodka, Meatballs, Veal Francese and Forlini's Torteli. We loved everything - so much so that ordered extra meatballs haha. Portions were a nice size but not gigantic which was perfect. For dessert we ordered the Tartufo and then our server gave us a Lemon Sorbet and Spumoni on the house. Everyone loved the desserts of course. I'd highly recommend coming here for any occasion. There is also a back room you can rent out for private parties!",0

10421,"Title: Delightful Reunion, Savory Overload

I recently dined at this establishment for a much-anticipated gathering with friends and family. The attentive staff provided us with the leisurely pace our reunion deserved, never rushing the joy of our catch-up. The wine list offered a thoughtful selection at agreeable prices, though the cocktail menu, while novel, failed to truly captivate my interest.

However, my dining experience was somewhat marred by an overarching theme: an excessive hand with salt. The bread, the grilled octopus dish – which surprised me in its presentation as a stack of overly salted, olive oil-drizzled potato slices rather than a chilled potato salad – and even the sautéed celery were all dominated by saltiness, diminishing my enjoyment of the otherwise beautifully prepared dishes.

Despite this, the lamb ragout pasta was a triumph of flavor – a dish so rich and compelling that it alone would entice me to return, despite only being able to indulge in a fraction of the portion.

From being re-seated by a considerate host away from an intrusive heat vent to the professional, unobtrusive service, the staff excelled at making our dining experience pleasant.

In conclusion, while my palate was tested by the salinity of some dishes, the excellence of the lamb ragout and the high standard of service will see me returning for another chance to further explore their culinary offerings.",1
3542,"Comfort SE food with a large selection on the menu. I like their wok noodles because it has the charred flavor from the old school woks on hot fire. The chao guo teow is great but a bit salty. It also comes with wide flat noodles, which I hear is more authentic than some of the thin noodles at other places. We always get the roti with chicken and potato curry. The curry is a bit spicy but tastes so good you can eat it with any rice or noodles. I also tried the S1, vegetable and tofu stuffed with homemade fish paste, which comes with clear or white curry broth and choice of noodles or rice.We also tried the anchovies minced meat noodle soup, which is an acquired taste. The anchovies do add umami to the soup but isn't a good choice if you don't like the crunchiness of the little fishies.Check in on yelp to get a small thai iced tea with your order of appetizer!",0
16836,"The food was not good... the french fries were okay. I ordered a steak chimi and CHICKEN tacos. I received steak tacos instead of chicken tacos, but I did not send them back because I thought the steak ones would be good anyway. The steak was cheap and flavorless, full of gooey fat pieces (as you can see in the picture). The steak chimi was also disappointing, and flavorless; I do not know what type of steak was used... oh, and how do you serve chimis and no chimi sauce!? The guac literally tasted like mashed avocado; no seasoning. The margaritas were okay. I do not think I would come back!",0
3537,"Title: A Night Out with a Dash of Intrigue at [Restaurant Name]

My recent group dinner at [Restaurant Name] proved to be an enjoyable affair with its unique speakeasy vibe that may not be for everyone, but certainly appealed to my penchant for the whimsical. Despite its clandestine allure, the entrance was well-marked and impossible to miss.

For those arriving early, the front bar offers a cozy spot for a pre-dinner cocktail. Be forewarned, the dining area does lean toward the dim and boisterous side, making it less than ideal for food photography enthusiasts but excellent for convivial tapas-sharing.

Culinary highlights included the innovative grilled cheese tomato soup dumplings that won unanimous praise from my companions, though I found myself partial to the fusion flair of the bulgogi ribeye tacos. 

And before you depart, make a detour to the ladies' restroom – it's more than just a facility but an experience in itself, with whispers of an occasional bartender serving drinks. It was a typical visit during my time, but the novelty wasn't lost on me.

In conclusion, [Restaurant Name] delivers a charismatic and flavorful evening out. Just remember to embrace the noise, the dark, and the delightful quirks.",1
1828,"I recently visited a local ramen spot and had their shoyu ramen. The broth was indeed rich, and the noodles were well-crafted, providing a solid base for the dish. They offer a convenient lunch set where you can add items like gyoza for an additional $3-5, which is a nice touch. However, aside from these aspects, the ramen experience didn't particularly stand out from the crowd. It's a decent option if you're in the area and craving ramen, but don't expect any culinary surprises.",1
18132,"Title: A Hidden Gem Worth Discovering

I recently had the pleasure of dining at a relatively undiscovered spot with a guest from Europe, and I'm convinced this place deserves a spot on everyone's brunch list. Despite some ongoing construction on the street that may initially deter some, stepping inside reveals a stunning interior. With its striking light fixtures, chic support posts, and a vibrant bar, the ambiance perfectly matches the glossy photos you might stumble upon online.

Our experience was made even more delightful by the prompt service – the food arrived swiftly, and it was clear the staff took their responsibilities to heart. Admittedly, there was a slight hiccup with a voucher I intended to use – a minor communication mishap with the hostess, but it was not enough to overshadow the quality of our visit.

All things considered, this place has earned a repeat customer, and I'm already contemplating hosting a small gathering in one of their private dining spaces. If you're in search of a new brunch haunt, I highly suggest joining me next time. Don't miss out on this culinary hideaway!",1

2381,"Title: A Taste of Southeast Asia in the West Village – Rasa Review

My quest for authentic Southeast Asian flavors took a pleasant turn when I stumbled upon Rasa in the West Village. Its presence as a Singaporean/Malay eatery amidst the western locale is both odd and refreshing. On a late Sunday evening, the welcoming staff had me seated in no time.

I zeroed in on the beef rendang with rice, a dish emblematic of Malaysian cuisine and a solid gauge of authenticity. Rasa's version met my cravings, though it fell shy of perfection. The rendang was satisfying but sweeter than traditional rendang, likely tweaked to cater to local palates. It's a gentle nudge to ethnic eateries like Rasa to embrace the richness of their heritage without dilution.

Portion size was the only true letdown – somewhat meager, especially for West Village standards. A bit more rice and curry on the plate would have been appreciated.

Despite these nuances, Rasa is a delightful rarity that brings a much-needed diversity to the area's dining scene, dominated by Italian and French options. Solid four stars for Rasa – where a bit more courage in culinary authenticity could make it a stellar five.",1

At the time when restaurants were only 50% capacity, the wait time was long. Suddenly my dining partner and I received the text and yes, we got seats right away at the counter. The decor is cute to boot with Thai inspired art with 70s retro vibes. I love the seating, countertops to the dish ware. I ordered the Thai Diner egg sandwich, my dining partner chose the George's egg sandwich and we shared the Thai disco fries. My egg sandwich was a bit greasy that I would have liked, but then again it's diner food, bring it on delicious. The disco fries, yes, get those because I'm still counting the months of when I can devour some cheesy goodness again. I would come back again and try some sweet dishes.",0
1479,"Super cozy and delightful!  I was fortunate enough to beat the crowd and snag a seat at the little bar space and had great service. Went with the mini lamb kebabs, some babaganoush, and falafel. The babaganoush came with the absolute most amazing pitas I have ever had. They were like pita clouds! So soft and fresh, and they have ruined regular pitas for me now as these were just too good! And their tahini sauce too. The babaganoush was super smooth. The mini lamb kebabs were more like lamb meat balls, and had a perfect blend of spices and great flavor.  Really lovely place!",0
1149,"Title: A Texan's Take on Mighty Quinn's BBQ in NYC

As a Texan on a quest for authentic BBQ in the Big Apple, my expectations were high when stepping into Mighty Quinn's, lured in by the promise of the legendary brontosaurus rib. The spread my companion and I chose was ambitious – a pound of brisket, sausage, the coveted rib, and a side of beans with burnt ends.

Unfortunately, Mighty Quinn's brisket didn't hit the mark – it was a disappointment with its dryness and lack of tenderness, a stark contrast to the succulent slices I hold dear. The sausage didn't resonate with my traditional BBQ palate either, offering an unfamiliar tang that was merely passable.

However, not all was lost. The brontosaurus rib lived up to its hype, delivering a fall-off-the-bone experience that was both flavorful and filling – a carnivore's delight. Accompanying beans, peppered with burnt ends, added a savory depth to the meal.

While Mighty Quinn's hasn't quite won my Texan heart, it serves as a decent outpost for those craving a taste of BBQ in the city. It may not beckon a return visit for me, but it's good enough if you're in need of a quick meaty fix.",1
20180,"During these challenging pandemic times, Dim Sum Palace has been an oasis for my cravings, offering a delightful reprieve with their impeccable takeout service.

I recommend ringing up about 40 minutes in advance to facilitate a smooth pickup. The care in packing the dishes was evident, preserving the quality and integrity of their sumptuous offerings. Having enjoyed their dine-in experience in the past, I can attest that Dim Sum Palace maintains its high standards, whether you're seated at their tables or savoring their cuisine at home.",1
18647,"Great lunch spot. Restaurant is close to the office and the kitchen is quick. Quality and taste are not compromised. I can easily enjoy lunch with waiter service for a good value. I opted for a rice dish, i.e., brown rice topped with grilled pork and grilled chicken. I couldn't make up my mind which protein I wanted and it was so affordable to add extra protein. I was already impressed brown rice was offered here. Besides that, everything was tasty, including the complimentary fried spring rolls. Vietnamese fried spring rolls and grilled meats are the best.

Meals come with 3 sides good white rice, yellow rice with beans good as well the Moro rice is very good. They plantains both Maduros for a little bit of sweetness or the green fried depending on your taste can't go wrong with either. Salad is a good addition along w the avocado or veggies.

10730,"Cute spot, not sure why it took me so long to try this place. I called at 6pm on a Wednesday asking for a 630pm reservation for two and it was no problem. We were seated by the windows in the front, which is where I wanted to be seated. I will admit, it is very tight in there. The inside décor is very cute and overall nice atmosphere. By 7, there were people standing at the door trying to get a table. I would say always make a reservation. We got: - Prickly pear margarita - Frozen passionfruit margarita (very sweet)- Taquitos platter (includes your choice of four taquitos, chips, guacamole, spicy fries for $22.50.... great deal in my opinion)o Taquitos: short rib, cauliflower, steak chimichurri, fish taco- Crispy eggplant bowlAll of the taquitos were really good. Everything else was just average. Fries were not crispy at all, tasted somewhat stale. Was really expecting more from the eggplant bowl, but they don't mix it for you, so it was sort of hard to eat/ share, especially since we were elbow to elbow with the table next to us. There are so many things on the menu, I would like to come back and give some other items a shot. Overall, good & cute vibes... good spot to grab drinks and food with friends.",0
19918,"Came here for happy hour and would highly recommend that you do the same. I'm not sure how their food is, but during happy hour many of their beers and cocktails are only $4 or $5 and all pretty decent.

It's a bit far from the parts of town where I usually hang out, but I would definitely make the trek out here to show friends sometime.",0
20956,"Title: A Satisfactory Experience at Midtown's Japanese Eatery

Upon craving uni nigiri, a friend and I decided to visit the Midtown branch of a restaurant I frequented in Union Square. Unfortunately, they were out of uni but we managed to enjoy a few of their other offerings.

The Japanese vegetable tempura was the highlight of our meal—each piece of Japanese eggplant, pumpkin, mushroom, and pepper was enveloped in a light, airy batter that managed to be blissfully free of any oily residue. It was truly a delightful dish.

We also sampled the twin tuna crisp roll which presented itself with visual flair. The roll was pretty and colorful, with generous proportions that made for a pleasing plate. However, it didn't quite hit the mark in terms of quality; the rice was mediocre, and the fish lacked the freshness one might expect from a top-tier Japanese restaurant.

Overall, while some aspects of the dining experience didn't live up to the highest standards, the meal was enjoyable enough, especially with the standout tempura. Worth a visit when you're in the area and in the mood for something quick and casual.",1

171,"This is one of the most beautiful dining spaces I've been to in Manhattan. I was here with a friend during the heat wave (100F - though felt much hotter!) who wanted to do a rooftop brunch before she left the city. RH Rooftop was perfect for the occasion, since it's INDOORS (with an outdoor patio if you'd like to have a look). Just keep in mind that table service is inside only.This is a super chic garden-tea-party-ladies-who-lunch kind of place. It would be a great place for a bridal shower, baby shower, or anything really. THEY DO NOT TAKE RESERVATIONS!We arrived right when they opened so we wouldn't have to wait. A few people were already in line since it was a Saturday morning. I ordered the burger, and my friend ordered the avocado toast. Both delicious. It wasn't the best burger I've ever had, but still very good.One thing of note: the eggs are pre-made. Not sure about the other dishes. My friend asked if she could have a hard boiled egg instead of the scrambled egg that comes with her avocado toast, and the waiter said that they could not accommodate. He said the eggs were a soft scramble - she then asked if they could cook it a bit longer since she isn't a fan of soft eggs, but again they couldn't accommodate because it's pre-made. I just thought that was a bit odd for a nice restaurant.Other than that, it was a fabulous experience. Beautiful space, beautiful decor, great service, sturdy table (we've all dined at places with wobbly tables...ugh), delicious food - would definitely recommend. Just hope you're okay with soft scrambled eggs.",0
2433,"Title: A Feast for the Eyes and Palate at Buddakan

From the moment I stepped into Buddakan, I was struck by its grandeur. Navigating the vast space felt akin to exploring an opulent castle, with its high ceilings adorned by majestic chandeliers that bestowed a Venetian elegance upon the main dining area. It's the perfect backdrop for a romantic date or a celebratory gathering with friends or family.

Delving into the menu, I was captivated by several dishes that are absolute must-tries. The Oxtail Dumplings, priced at $18, were a true delight - plump, exceptionally flavorful, and brimming with juiciness. Another standout was the $17 Shrimp Toast, which paired a perfectly crunchy exterior with a zesty spicy mayo topping. But it was the Chili Rock Shrimp, at $24, that stole the show for me – it's a dish I still daydream about!

On to the heartier options, the Mongolian Lamb Chops, though a steeper $38, were a masterclass in tenderness. However, not all that glitters is gold. The Short Rib Scallion Pancake, also $18, was a letdown with an unpleasant aftertaste I'd recommend you pass on. Similarly, the Wild Mushroom Chow Fun, while reasonably priced at $16, suffered from being slightly overcooked.

In summary, Buddakan dazzles with its ambiance and most of its menu, promising a dining experience that's both visually and gastronomically gratifying. Just steer clear of a couple of underwhelming options, and you're in for a memorable epicurean adventure.",1

19299,"Title: A Taste of Authenticity Amidst Trendy Decor

Upon first glance, the modern decorations of this Chinese eatery might lead one to expect a fusion experience, but don't be fooled—the cuisine here is as authentic as it gets. The menu options are impressively solid across the board. While the jook isn't the standout dish, it's still a hearty and satisfying choice.

The real culinary delights began with the Chang Fen. The shrimp and chives variation was succulent, and the egg rendition didn't disappoint either. But the star of the show was undoubtedly the deep-fried bun, an indulgent treat made irresistible when dipped into sweet, creamy condensed milk. Following closely were the Chang Fen for its delightful flavors and the delectable sticky rice.

Service on a bustling Saturday night may have had a few hiccups, with a slight delay in staffing attention requiring some proactive effort to place orders and request the bill. Despite this, the overall experience was positive and left me eager to return on my next visit to the neighborhood.",1

Last night's bustling scene at Sidewalk deterred us, but a return visit this evening proved a wise choice. The immediate greeting and seating were a refreshing start. Our waiter expertly balanced efficiency with warmth, deftly juggling professional service and enjoyable conversation.

The extensive menu posed a delightful challenge, ultimately leading us to choose the fried calamari and the Sidewalk burger. The calamari surpassed the usual, boasting a perfect contrast of crispy exterior and tender, non-rubbery interior. However, the real star was the burger, featuring an over-easy egg that pleasantly erupted with flavor, complemented by a slightly over-crisp bacon and a memorably cheesy, succulent beef patty.

We capped the meal with a S'mores spiked milkshake, a cozy concoction with an authentic roasted marshmallow flavor that packed a satisfying punch. Sidewalk left us thoroughly impressed and eager for a second round. Our rating: an emphatic 11/10.",1

Sipping on a Dutch's Punch, which I must say was flawlessly concocted, I couldn't help but rate it a perfect 10/10. The Sunrise in Lima didn't lag far behind, proving itself as another stellar choice. However, what truly stole the show was the food. The Eggs Benedict, a dish so often mishandled, was executed to perfection here, effortlessly solidifying its classic status. The Tres Leches French Toast, on the other hand, was a wild twist on tradition—and absolutely delectable at that.

15833,"Title: A Flavorful Experience with Room for Improvement

I recently dined at a restaurant where my experience teetered between delight and slight disappointment, ultimately leading me to rate it 3 stars, although if I could, I'd lean towards 3.5. The highlights of the meal were unquestionably the appetizers and sides. The fried chicken wings stood out with their impeccable seasoning, striking the perfect balance between crispy and juicy. The crispy tuna did not disappoint either, and their fresh, hot rolls set a comforting tone for the meal.

The entrees were a bit of a mixed bag. A fellow diner's lamb chops appeared to be the star of the evening, and the coconut sauce accompanying the grilled shrimp left a memorable impression on my palate. My choice, the chicken dish, boasted an authentic Senegalese sauce, which, while flavorful with an abundance of vegetables, lacked the richness of coconut milk that I found so appealing in other dishes.

Dessert maintained the meal's high notes, with a standout molten chocolate dessert reminiscent of the renowned creations at Jean George, which I also enjoy making at home. The crème brûlée and tiramisu were competently executed, with the tiramisu being notably satisfying.

One aspect that detracted from the overall comfort was the restaurant's decision to keep the door open on a hot summer day. Although the internal temperature became more bearable as the meal progressed, a swifter response to the heat would have been appreciated.

The service was good, attentive without being overbearing, which helped smooth over any discomfort caused by the warmth.

In summary, the restaurant delivers on taste and service, but could improve the ambiance and attention to diners' comfort. A solid choice for anyone seeking well-executed dishes with a few areas left to perfect.",1
17346,"my experience - came here on a thursday night at around 10:00 pm after watching wicked across the street. we knew they closed at 11:00 pm so we ordered right away. the food came super quickly! location wise, they have a great spot because they are right across the street from gershwin theater.when we walked in, we were greeted right away and it seemed to be a higher-end japanese restaurant with the dim lights (reminded me of a spot from home!)prices and food - my friend ordered the chirashi which was $25.00 and a pretty average price for what it is. the fish here is quite good, although i am not the biggest fan of raw fish so i cannot give the best opinionfor me, i got the california roll (6 pcs for $6.00) and grilled salmon teriyaki ($25.40) there was nothing too special about the california roll, it is a classic so i am glad they kept it that way. fresh avocado but not sure how fresh the crab meat was but for the price definitely good!for the grilled salmon teriyaki it is something you can share (which i did)they have shittake mushrooms and avocado with teriyaki sauce all over the plate and a bowl of rice on the side. it was super hot when it came out and clearly made fresh. i would say there was about 10 oz of salmon which is plenty for two people. for the price this item was and if you share, it is not too bad especially due to location.overall, give it a try. it's not bad but there was nothing special that caught my eye. prices aren't terrible and you are getting what you pay for. especially because of where it is located, i don't think it is overpriced. come stop by, definitely a great date spot after a show!",0
13481,"I love ramen establishments like these. Small, minimalism, and ramen that looks like it's an artwork in itself. Came here during the Christmas holidays with my parents as part of our annual trip to NYC.Seeing how the chef used to work at Ippudo, a lot of Ippudo's staples are in the menu. My family started with the crab cream croquet, karrage, and pork bun. All were amazingly delicious and definitely worth it.I had the Unami Miso Ramen, and the ramen was probably one of the best I've had. I like my ramen thick, and it was perfectly thick. The broth was delicious but could've been warmer and plentiful though, as the noodles absorbed more of the soup than I wanted. The pork belly was flavourful and the ingredients placement was very well done.Service is order thru counter. Don't expect much interactions otherwise. My dad said he preferred Nakamura a bit more, but also enjoyed here. I personally enjoyed here, and have recommended this place to friends who may visit in the future.",0
10281,"Title: Great Atmosphere, But Food Falls Flat

I recently visited this restaurant for a friend's birthday celebration, attracted by its beautiful decor and reports of excellent service. True to word, the staff was indeed welcoming and incredibly accommodating. However, I find myself compelled to give a modest 3-star rating, primarily due to the food experiences that fell short of expectations.

Our group of seven sampled various appetizers including crab cakes, calamari, and oysters. The crab cakes were unfortunately served cold and lacked flavor, though the accompanying slaw did receive some praise. The calamari and oysters fared better and were generally enjoyed.

My main disappointment was with the mussels in a white wine sauce. The dish was notably bland, requiring a borrowed squeeze of lemon to add some semblance of zest. Additionally, the bread served alongside was disappointingly hard. Other dishes at the table, such as a pasta entrée that arrived cold and underwhelming lamb chops, mirrored this sentiment of culinary letdown.

Despite these setbacks, the visit wasn't without its positives; the drinks I ordered were quite enjoyable. It is with a heavy heart that I reflect on what could have been a delightful dining experience. The exemplary service deserved to be paired with food of equal caliber.",1
18910,"My craving for poke was thoroughly satisfied at this spot! The restaurant offers an impressive array of toppings, each of which I found to my liking. The spicy aioli and ponzu sauce I chose added a delightful kick to my meal, elevating the flavors and leaving me truly content. A great choice for any poke enthusiast!",1

18382,"Title: Mixed Experiences, Unlikely to Return

I've had two delivery experiences from this spot, and neither has justified a third. My initial order, the Biggs Cobb Salad, was a classic mixture of grilled chicken, blue cheese, and other typical Cobb ingredients. Unfortunately, the $15 price tag felt steep for what was ultimately a decent but not extraordinary salad. To my surprise, it didn't come with blue cheese dressing, and the unidentified dressing provided missed the mark for my palate.

My second venture was an attempt at redemption with their chicken fingers. At $9, the description of ""breaded chicken breast tenders with honey mustard"" sounded promising. However, I was met with a mere trio of thin and unappetizingly dry chicken pieces that put my plastic utensil's durability to the test. The only saving grace was the crunch of the breading and the delightful honey mustard sauce, which I did relish.

Despite the honey mustard, I can't overlook the disappointments. I'm afraid I won't be ordering from here again.",1
15324,"Title: A Solid Korean BBQ Experience at 22W 32nd Street

I recently had my first foray into the Korean BBQ scene at an A-graded spot on the second floor of 22W 32nd Street. The service was impeccable; staff members were always on their toes, ready to refill our banchan and clear the table of any dish we were done with.

We opted for the pork platter and yook gejang (spicy beef stew). The pork was cooked tableside on a cast iron grill by our attentive waitress, who took her time to ensure it was done just right. Though I've had more succulent cuts at other restaurants, the portion was generous enough to satisfy our group of three.

The yook gejang packed a spicy punch that was a tad too fiery for my palate, yet I couldn't stop myself from finishing the whole bowl. The stew's heat might not be for everyone, but it's worth a try for those who can handle it.

Cleanliness was top-notch, and the prices didn’t break the bank. Overall, it was a pleasant dining experience that has me considering a second visit for another round of Korean BBQ.",1
20498,Shinshi is one of the few restaurants with tsukemen (dipping ramen) in NYC. It's a good place if you're looking for a bowl of ramen especially if you're tired of the more famous spots like Totto / Ippudo. Shinshi also offers a rewards stamp card  where 6 stamps = 1 free salad and 12 stamps = 1 free ramen. The restaurant is located below ground level so might be a bit difficult to find. I've never had to wait for a table and the restaurant seems like it would be good for small groups. Service is attentive and quick.I usually order the Spicy Miso Ramen or Tsukemen. My main complaint is that the flavor of the broth doesn't thoroughly coat the noodles unlike other tsukemen places that I've been to. I prefer the broth to be thicker for tsukemen and a bit more flavorful for normal ramen. I appreciate that they have a fully vegetarian ramen though.,0
11519,"Been wanting to try Thai Villa for a while now even though they seem like they're mostly known for just their ambiance. It's beautiful when you walk in and a great date spot! They don't take reservations for smaller parties so I put myself on their waitlist via yelp as soon as they opened at 5pm. It was probably 5:15pm and I was already 18th in line, about 1.5hour wait. I checked in around 5:45pm and they offered us bar seating about 15 minutes later. We didn't feel like waiting so we opted for the bar- the view and ambiance isn't as nice but oh well. To start, we had the tom yum wings and coconut fried calamari. Both were really good and I would come back just for the appetizers. For entree, I had the green curry with the crispy duck, per the bartender's recommendation and my partner had the signature pad thai. There are different variations of pad thai and curries so pay attention to whether you are ordering off the signature chef menu or the regular side. I didn't really enjoy the green curry too much, it was my first time having it and it was too coconut-y. The crispy duck was reallly good and they didn't skimp out on meat portions though! The pad thai was pretty good but nothing stand out other than presentation. Would come back just to try more appetizers but not sure if it would be worth the wait for regular seating or the entrees.",0
16411,not bad but not great either after a night out we came her for some drinks and something to bite on the food was ok nothing special we had the mac n cheese with bacon and some fried calamari we all had drinks they were just ok even the house specialty drinks after one drink we decide to call it a night and moved on somewhere else,0
15639,"Title: Charming Brunch and Wine Haven

If you're in search of a spot that offers an exquisite wine selection, scrumptious brunch options, and outstanding service, look no further. This delightful restaurant is an absolute treasure with its appealing interiors, making our book club's weather-induced transition from coffee shop to wine bar a delightful surprise.

As an added treat, a complimentary mimosa or Prosecco accompanies your entree—a generous touch to the dining experience. The menu is moderately priced, yet the dishes arrive with a presentation that rivals upscale eateries and taste every bit as good as they look. The avocado toast, unexpectedly adorned with small radish slices, was a revelation. And the chocolate cake, drizzled with a tart raspberry sauce, was nothing short of divine.

I can't recommend this place enough. Just a small tip: secure your reservations via Yelp, especially for larger groups, to avoid any additional charges that may apply when booking over the phone. Your palate (and your book club) will thank you!",1
1995,"Quick little breakfast spot right across from my hotel! It was raining so we didn't want to walk far, and came across this spot. A bit on the pricey side given the items are fairly basic, for example, $11 for breakfast toast with egg. I got the Spoon Egg Sammie with bacon which happens to be one of the bigger portions, but also on the lighter side. I'm not a big fan of tomatoes whatsoever, but I very much enjoyed these that were mixed in with the egg. Tasted almost like a pasta sauce in each bite of tomato. I would definitely comeback here again, especially for a quick breakfast bite with the family!",0
305,"I recently visited Tonii's, a new noodle spot in Chinatown on Bayard Street, which didn't disappoint. They offer a wide array of steamed noodle dishes, soups, and beverages, with the bonus of self-service condiments to customize your meal. I opted for the Tonii's special rice noodles, a generous and flavorful mix of beef, chicken, and dried shrimp. Also tasting the shrimp rice noodles and the hearty ramen soup with fish balls, I found all the dishes satisfyingly delicious with ample portions at a fair price. A pleasant surprise was their offering of Kam Hing's Famous sponge cake, a beloved local treat. Tonii's has earned a return visit on my next trip to Chinatown.",1
2385,Read the reviews and saw this place was on a list of ramen places so decided to try it out.  Went to their website and found out it was by iron chef Morimoto so the bar might be a bit high in my mind but I'll break it down Decor/atmosphere felt a bit cramped as it was busy.  No surprise there but the wait wasn't terribly long about 30-40 minutes.  but if it wasn't it's pretty nice.l as upon entry you see all the selections of alcohol and looked clean.Staff:  the waiter was nice attentive however there was staff at the end of the meal which felt like we were being rushed.  A little understandable as people were waiting but never like that feeling.  Food:  had ordered the duck taco and the short rib ramen as they only have 20 bowls per day.  When we were there there were 8 left so figure had to try it.  Also the duck ramen was sold out.  The duck taco tasted very good.  Duck tender not dry sauce which was an apricot chili sauce was very good.  A little messy to eat but worth it. The ramen though didn't very meet my expectations.  Noodles were wavy so it captured the broth well the soup base tasted a bit bland but when I finished it apparently the black pepper sank to the bottom.  The braised short rib very tender.  Fell off the bone however didn't very much taste like anything.  Added the pork belly as a topping and thank god I did.  Went from beef little to no flavor to pork belly a lot of flavor.  Easily best part of the ramen.  The egg cooked great just the texture I liked gooey.Overall good to try once.  Don't know if I'd come back though.,0
12445,"I've visited several branches of this restaurant, and I'm happy to report the food quality is reliably excellent across the board. That said, I couldn't help but notice the portions at this location are a tad smaller compared to their generous servings in the Financial District, where I'm accustomed to a plate brimming with broccoli. But even if my appetite desires a bit more, I'm always pleased by the restaurant's cleanliness and the undeniable freshness of their meals. It's a safe bet for a good dining experience.",1
10110,"Title: A Sunday Brunch to Remember at Friedman's

I'm delighted to share my recent brunch experience at Friedman's, which turned out to be nothing short of fantastic. Thanks to the Yelp app, my friend and I effortlessly added our names to the waitlist on a bustling Sunday, navigating an hour-long queue with ease. Even with my slightly late arrival, the staff graciously seated us within a generous five-minute window, averting an additional lengthy wait.

Our server, Will, exuded warmth and attentiveness from the get-go, making us feel welcome amidst the packed setting. His prompt service and genuine concern for dietary preferences, which I particularly valued as a vegetarian, truly enhanced our dining experience.

The meal itself was served with remarkable speed, beginning with a perfectly balanced chai latte, boasting a delightful harmony of sweetness and spice. My choice of the mushroom toast was met with an equally impressive execution - savory, lightly-seasoned mushrooms atop crispy toast, accompanied by the rich flavors of fried egg and creamy burrata.

The thoughtful addition of a special bread knife was a small but appreciated touch, ensuring convenience in savoring each delicious bite. My companion's crispy chicken sandwich also earned her high praise.

Throughout the meal, Will's consistent check-ins maintained the feeling of care we'd come to appreciate, never diminishing even after the bill was settled. We parted from Friedman's with the contentment of a fulfilling meal, unhurried despite the ongoing demand for seats.

For those in quest of a stellar brunch experience, Friedman's easily earns my hearty recommendation.",1
10845,"We came here for brunch with a group of 6. Service was excellent I must say and perhaps the reason for the 4 star review more than the food. They truly did not rush our group and let us linger through our meal and length conversation. The food was average, nothing to write home about. We had baked eggs and polenta with coffee and cocktails. But the company was great and we all had a good time.",0
3364,"Upon spotting this eatery on a roundup of New York's affordable dining spots, my hopes of discovering a hidden gem were high. However, the experience fell short. With each bun priced around $6, I expected more than the small portions received. Sadly, the food itself didn't redeem the size; both the fried chicken and pork belly buns lacked the flavorful punch I had anticipated. Additionally, the eatery's limited seating posed a challenge. Overall, this place didn't quite meet the expectations set by its 'good cheap eats' reputation.",1
19098,"My experience at the Cantonese restaurant left much to be desired, particularly when it came to value. Celebrating my father's 80th birthday, my family reserved a table for 15, looking forward to the special King Crab dish. The restaurant presented us with a sizable 12lb crab, prepared three delightful ways: fried, sautéed with garlic over noodles, and in fried rice. While the flavors were commendable, the price was exorbitant at $850, equating to $70 per pound, significantly higher than the usual $50 per pound maximum at other establishments. Despite the culinary satisfaction, the overall experience was marred by the steep cost, totaling an oppressive $1800, which I felt was an unfair overcharge for a family celebration.",1
12146,Indulgence that it's finest. I've never been to Eataly before so a friend and I decided to go in and indulge. I particularly love pasta so I went straight for that I decided I'm not eating any pizza the pasta was cooked superbly. The staff was great and courteous and all the food came out on time and came piping hot. I was being greedy so I decided to eat all my pasta at that point in time but everything was really great and I definitely would go back. The fig and goat cheese bruschetta was the bomb and my pasta was cooked perfectly with just a right amount of cheese!,0
20558,"I recently ordered the Spandex bowl from this restaurant via UberEats and while the taste was satisfactory, I was disappointed by the portion size. The bowl arrived with a scant serving that barely covered half the container, consisting of a single egg, a couple avocado slices, a handful of shredded carrots, and a modest amount of quinoa. To make matters worse, the quinoa was excessively oily. Unfortunately, the meal didn't come close to being filling, which was particularly disheartening considering the cost. Overall, I was left underwhelmed by the experience.",1
17727,"Decent taco spot. From the outside looking in, the orange letters are pretty hard to miss. The interior gives you a relaxed vibe with the limited seating and complete view of the kitchen. Stopping by on a Tuesday and given the name, it was pretty hard not to get tacos. Tacos were $3 which isn't bad considering the fresh to made meats and decent portions. Overall, the meats in the taco were a little salty, but overall the tacos weren't too bad. Will come back another Tuesday and snag the $2 Taco Tuesday Beer special!",0
11192,"One of the better burgers I have had in NYC. I ordered the Frank Lucas burger and the Upper Westsider a turkey burger.

Will definitely be back",0
15851,"Came here during Restaurant Week but was so upset when I realized they didn't have a dinner menu for it. My best friend and I wanted to try it so we decided to stay and order food anyways. We ordered the filet mignon and added truffle to it. It was amazing, I have no complaints. The truffle fries were so good, crunchy just how I like it. The chicken we ordered was probably one of the best ones I've had. The skin was so crunchy, the meat was so flavored and not dry at all. I would definitely recommend trying this place but be aware, it is super pricey but worth it.",0
13963,"Title: A Hidden Gem Finally Discovered!

After years on the scene, I finally visited this local establishment at 7 PM on a quiet Saturday. Instant seating was a plus, and I kicked off the experience with their signature cocktail, 'Driving Miss Maizey.' A word of caution: it packs a spicy punch! I soon swapped it for a wine that was more to my palate.

The appetizer, bone marrow, required a 25-minute wait, but it was worth every second. Rich, buttery, garlicky goodness spread over toast, with a side of sweet balsamic glaze—truly delightful. My main, the braised beef ravioli, was tender and complemented by a creamy ricotta spread. We also nibbled on truffle fries, which, while average, did not disappoint.

But the night's unexpected star was the homemade donut holes—irresistible and devoured enthusiastically despite our full bellies. These gooey, sugary delights come highly recommended.

Accompanied by attentive service and reasonable pricing, this place has secured a spot on my 'must-return' list, with their gnocchi up next for tasting. A splendid dining experience awaits anyone who visits.",1
16188,"Title: A Local's Favorite: Dos Caminos in Times Square

As a seasoned New Yorker with a penchant for Mexican cuisine, I've explored Dos Caminos across the city, yet the Times Square location truly stands out. Despite my initial skepticism given the tourist-heavy area, this spot has won over my local's heart.

Membership in the Loyalty Service Club (LSC) enhances my experiences here, providing exceptional service that's consistent and personal, with the manager often stopping by to ensure our satisfaction—even during a casual happy hour.

The restaurant's layout boasts a lively yet cozy ambiance, with the lower level housing a vibrant bar scene perfect for after-work relaxation or pre-show libations. From Monday to Friday, the happy hour offers unbeatable deals from 3-6pm and again from 9pm until closing. The bar area, well-appointed with comfortable seating options, is an ideal setting to enjoy their specials.

During my latest visit before catching a Broadway show, my server William was the epitome of hospitable, going the extra mile with personalized touches like bringing extra servings of our favored salsa verde. Their complimentary chips and dip set the stage for a culinary treat, with mouthwatering margaritas. The house margarita is flavorful, while the prickly pear is refreshingly juice-like—a steal at $8.50 during happy hour.

For small bites, the guacamole reigns supreme—appearing modest in size but ample for sharing, it's a delectable bargain at $7. While I've indulged in their generous dinner portions on other occasions, Dos Caminos is my top choice for happy hour, providing quality and value that's simply unbeatable in the Big Apple.",1
21115,"Went here a couple weeks ago with my boyfriend and it was absolutely delicious. The waiters were very friendly and it was a lovely place for a date night. I had the gnocchi which was delicious, melt in your mouth gnocchi. My boyfriend had the cannelloni, which I loved more than him. He liked my gnocchi more since he wasn't a huge fan of the bechamel sauce but I loved his dish too. It's about preference, because he couldn't lie and say the flavors weren't fantastic. The bread was yum that went great with like an olive pate, and I don't like olives but it was tasty. As for our appetizers we got the pick 3, and I'm so glad we did. The meatballs were delicious, but the octopus was my favorite. The shrimp and zucchini were good as well but the other two I enjoyed more.",0
18387,"Title: A Gem of a Place, Despite the Decibels!

Upon entering the restaurant, the first impressions were overwhelmingly positive, thanks to the delightful atmosphere that radiates a homey charm. It's a venue where the joy is palpable—patrons are visibly savoring their time here.

Let's talk about Marvin, our server; his name deserves to be in lights! Marvin's enthusiasm and genuine concern for our dining experience were nothing short of stellar. In a world where service can often be perfunctory, Marvin's positive energy and attentiveness earned him, and the establishment, a resounding five stars.

On to the crux of any restaurant review—the cuisine. The Egg Foo Young I ordered was a revelation. The flavors were vibrant, and the dish had a freshness to it that was both unexpected and delightful. The accompanying soft rice served as the perfect substrate for the well-executed entree.

Two minor quibbles: the prices are on the higher side, and the ambient noise level could give a bustling marketplace a run for its money. However, these are but small blemishes on an otherwise superb dining canvas.

In sum, despite the strain on the wallet and ears, the overall experience was excellent, with delectable food to match the high spirits of the environment. Would I return? Absolutely—and I'd request Marvin's section again!",1
10051,"I came here for dinner for my mom's birthday. Upon walking in, I had noticed that the restaurant is very small. There were maybe 10 tables and 15 bar stools. The tables were very close, so we got to know our neighbors well. All the dishes are Spanish tapas. However, the price would suggest the the meals were regular entree sizes. This is not the place for someone who has a large appetite but I did leave feeling satisfied. The four of us shared 7 tapas and a dessert. Our waiter suggested to us that we order a bunch of tapas at once We had the skirt steak, oxtail stuffed peppers, lamp chops, duck breast, patatas bravas, pork meatballs, and I cannot remember the last dish. And for dessert, we had the bread pudding.We were given bread at the table with olive oil. All of the tapas were delicious. However, the sauces that came with them were very salty. I felt like it was missing a carb to absorb the extra salt. I used the bread at the table and dipped it in the sauce and that made it more tolerable. I would recommend this restaurant, if I know that the people are not big eaters.",0
12633,"Recently, I took advantage of a fantastic offer at a local restaurant that included 2 meals and 4 drinks at a tantalizing price, considerably less than usual. The quality of the food and drinks did not disappoint. The mac and cheese burger stood out for its flavor, though it was served lukewarm which meant the cheese lacked that alluring meltiness. Similarly, the steak didn't arrive hot, but the accompanying brussel sprouts were a delightful contrast, served piping hot with tasty bits of bacon and almonds. The cocktail selection was impressive, with particular mention to a jalapeno tequila drink that packed quite the punch - perhaps too spicy for some. The bourbon concoction was good, though it would benefit from a slight tweak, perhaps a touch more lemon or honey to balance the flavors. Despite the minor setbacks with temperature, the overall experience was enjoyable and the offer made it well worth a visit.",1
2508,"High hopes for Nino's 46 based on past reviews, however, the food fell flat.My husband and I have been using Friday date nights to try new restaurants in our neighborhood and we came across Nino's 46. The restaurant is in a good location and the overall ambience is quaint.We made a reservation for 10:15 p.m. and we're super stoked to try the food based on the menu we saw online.We arrived right on time and were sat immediately. There was only one other couple in the restaurant which we thought was very ofd for a Friday night. We ordered two glasses of wine to start and placed our food order. For an appetizer we ordered the truffled mac & cheese bites which were fantastic and full of flavor; unfortunately this is where the buck stops. For our main courses I had the spinach gnudi which could be good if it did not taste like play-doh. The spinach made the dish very dry and the almonds did nothing for the dish overall. My husband had the lasagnette and was very unimpressed, he stated that the cold ricotta clumped on the top of the dish was very unappetizing and made it hard to stomach.The service was just mediocre and the waitress seemed like she was checked out for the evening.Overall I would not recommend dining at Nino's 46. Had it not been for the Mac & cheese bites this would be a two star review.",0
15091,"During a recent visit from Baltimore, I had the pleasure of dining at this gem of a restaurant, and it lived up to every expectation. The interior, with its charming walls, caught my eye immediately, adding to the overall aesthetic that I simply adored. Efficiency is key here, as the speed of service is remarkable, ensuring that delicious food lands on your table in no time.

While there's a bit of call noise, the volume remains at a comfortable level, allowing for easy conversation. The clever design of three small menus hanging at the table is a thoughtful touch, providing options without cluttering the space. It's a thoughtful consideration that speaks volumes about the restaurant's attention to customer experience.

In summary, this establishment offers a delightful atmosphere paired with prompt service, making it an irresistible spot I'm eager to revisit. It's a venue that makes you feel right at home without any sense of being overwhelmed—a rare find indeed.",1

3630,"Title: A Late-Night Gem for Post-Broadway Bites

Finding a spot for a late meal in the city can be a challenge, but this restaurant is a dazzling exception that stays open until the wee hours of 4am. Tucked away near Broadway, it was a welcome discovery after a 10pm show when much of the neighborhood had closed up shop. Despite its medium size, the buzz inside made it feel like the peak of lunch hour.

The menu had a delightful range of selections, and we opted for the lo mein omelette and the agodashi ramen. As a ramen aficionado, I found the pork broth to be rich and immensely satisfying, complemented perfectly by tender pork and a skillfully prepared seasoned egg. The noodles were also spot-on – not too soft, not too firm.

For those who prefer a non-noodle dish, the lo mein omelette offers an interesting twist, blending classic flavors in an innovative way. It's worth a try for omelette enthusiasts.

An unexpected but appreciated touch was the complimentary hot tea, served at the meal's end, which was the perfect capstone to the dining experience. This unassuming spot delivered both on ambiance and flavor, making it a great find for any night owl with a post-theater appetite.",1
12657,"Price is superb for this area! Great deal and service is very nice!Came here for quick dinner one night and ordered the sashimi and sushi combo for $25. For this area it's such a deal. The sashimi was thick and even though it was not a super high cut, it was very fresh. The rolls that comes with the combo is really tasty. I was full after eating the combo. I also got an avocado appetizer complimentary of the chef that tasted really good. Ordered the uni sashimi and that was not great. Would not order that again.Service was very nice and attentive. Sushi chefs were all very nice and efficient. Overall very pleasant experience.",0
12299,We went on a Saturday evening without a reservation and we ha to wait almost 80 minutes to get a table. Please reserve if you want a table and they do not take reservations if you are 2 people. We had the hot pot and it was delicious. The choice of veggies and meat were excellent. Try their potato pancakes. If you have a big group and its an amazing place to hangout and share food. The service was good and we enjoyed the experience. The hot pot is $25 per person+tax. Finally you can get a scoop of free ice cream too. The ambience of the place is excellent. It might get a bit loud a bit if the restaurant is full.,0
12788,"Title: Hidden Gem for Authentic Ramen

If you’re in search of a genuine ramen spot with Japanese staff and ample space to dine without the dread of long lines, then you’ve hit the jackpot with this place. On our visit, the starters set a high bar, with the seaweed salad and karaage pleasing our taste buds, the edamame a reliable standby, and the pork belly bun being the only average performer.

The main event, the ramen, was memorable. My Bow Chili ramen, despite its non-spicy nature, had a broth rich in flavor. Pro tip: don't overindulge in appetizers; the generous noodle serving is a challenge to finish. A return visit had me trying the Tan Tan Men, which hands down stole the show and came highly recommended over the Bow Chili. The vegetarian Tan Tan ramen, enhanced by a mushroom broth, won over my friend, while the classic tonkotsu satisfied another.

We couldn’t leave without trying the takoyaki, surprisingly delightful, even for someone who's not a fan. The sweet ending came courtesy of the staff, who sang a birthday tune and presented a candle-lit dessert upon request, making our celebration even more special.

Bottom line: This restaurant offers a winning combo of standout food, attentive service, and comfortable ambiance. Just remember, keep this treasure on the down-low!",1
10659,"I stopped for a quick lunch at this local spot and it didn't disappoint. The yellow rice on my plate was notably fluffy and seasoned to perfection. Paired with generous chunks of chicken that struck the perfect balance between tenderness and crispiness, it was a mouthwatering combination. While the dish included the standard fare of iceberg lettuce and tomatoes, what really set it apart were the delicious black beans. They aren't something you typically find at halal carts, but they truly completed the meal, making it not just satisfying but memorable.",1
1297,"I recently dined at a local seafood restaurant and had a pleasant overall experience. The Snow Crab and shrimp boil, paired with their signature Boil sauce, was delicious and generous in portion – so much so that I couldn't finish it in one go. However, the Crab Cake, priced at $15, was a letdown due to its lack of flavor and being a solitary piece. Also, a heads-up for future patrons: the establishment is cash-only, something I wish I knew before attempting to settle the bill with my card.",1
20333,"I recently stumbled upon a quaint little spot that might easily be overlooked, but I'm glad I didn't pass it by. The food at this unassuming hole in the wall was a delightful surprise. I chose the Carne Asada plate – a decision I'd make again in a heartbeat. The meat was tender, each bite bursting with robust flavor. In short, don't let the size of this place fool you; the food speaks volumes.",1
15455,"I may be easily swayed since I'm a broke postgrad student who would jump at the chance to eat at a steakhouse, but Benjamin Prime truly blew me away. It's a sister to Benjamin Steakhouse, but this restaurant is slightly more modern and offers more variety of dishes beyond steak. TL;DR: Everything was amazing and I'm salivating just thinking about the food Porterhouse for 2 - We ordered medium-rare and it was absolutely delicious; probably one of my favorite steaks ever ordered at a restaurant. The texture had a slight chew, but very tender and juicy. The fattier portions of the porterhouse were beyond savory. Tuna Tartare - Even though it's a steakhouse, the tartare was done extraordinarily well! Half of the side was tuna, the other side was salmon. The tartare mixture was slightly tart but well balanced with small crostini. Brussel Sprouts - The best brussel sprouts in a restaurant, ever. They were slightly charred but generously glazed with honey. I would honestly be fine eating a meal with just this side dish. Prime Home Fries - One of the few times home fries were done so well that I didn't need any additional salt or condiments.Service and restaurant ambiance were stellar.",0
10878,"Title: Decent Vietnamese Fare Amidst Limited New York Options

If you're navigating the New York dining scene with a Vietnamese food craving, this spot can provide a satisfactory, though not remarkable, experience. As a Californian accustomed to a plethora of Vietnamese options, I found this establishment to fall short of the Golden State's standards.

The meal kicked off on a promising note with the egg rolls, which were commendably crispy, but the fillings didn't pack the punch I was hoping for. They were served with the typical accompaniment of herbs and veggies, which met expectations. 

However, my anticipation for the banh xeo was met with disappointment. In what is typically a delightfully crispy affair, I was instead greeted by a mushy rendition that failed to maintain its exterior texture. Despite being generously served with vegetables, an overabundance of lettuce and cucumbers made for a rather unbalanced dish.

Service proved to be sluggish, particularly during the bustling lunch rush, which could be a deterrent for those with limited time.

In summary, while this spot won't wow the discerning palate, it offers a serviceable Vietnamese option in a city with fewer choices in this cuisine.",1

2189,Hidden little gem tucked away on a small quiet street in New York. Walked in and had a reservation that my guy friend had planned already but we were a little early- but the waitstaff was friendly and looked through his schedule to see where he could fit us- he sat us right away. He sat us right smack in between two tables which was a little strange cause we were so close together- but it was a small place and everyone was close together. My friend was raving about some burger they are known for and I thought the pizza sounded good. Chicago style is sorta like pan pizza and I know I like pan pizza so I went with the grammy which is basically a cheese pizza- he got the burger and fries which was one of their best sellers. I noticed everyone in the spot had pizza on their tables so I think my choice was a good one. My friend said it was national pizza day- so it makes sense to have it. The food came quickly and the waitress was fast and friendly. His burger was huge and juicy and came with a ton of curly fries. My pizza was crispy and cheesy and so flavorful. I was so happy and my stomach was happy. This was the first time in weeks I felt like finally showing my new guy friend I can eat like a beast-- and I did- I ended up eating about 3 slices of the pizza cause it was so damn good. The prices were a bit high then I'm used too but for the taste of the pizza and how satisfying it was it was worth it. My guy was also saying that he loved his burger and it was so juicy. I'd definitely come back another day if I'm ever in that area.,0
20573,"Really yummy but super pricey! Make sure you make a reservation here because there are always lines going out the door. You get to choose your seafood and your toppings and then you get to eat it like any other seafood place. They give you gloves and bib so you don't get anything dirty. The reason I love this place over others is the freshness of the food. The sauces are also SO good and they definitely don't skimp out. Also pro tip: this place is cash only so make sure you bring cash with you. If it wasn't as pricey, I would be coming back once a week but for special occasions, I would come again.Price: 2/5 Food: 5/5Service: 5/5",0
20571,"Title: A New Year's Day Delight at Lil Frankie's

My visit to Lil Frankie's on New Year's Day was an absolute treat. This snug, likely family-owned gem provided a warm welcome with a complimentary glass of champagne to celebrate the new year, setting the tone for a memorable dining experience.

The lemon pasta and margarita pizza were nothing short of spectacular, with each bite boasting the freshness and quality that would leave any food lover yearning for more. Indeed, sitting here recounting that lemon pasta has my taste buds longing for a return visit.

A peek at their brunch menu hinted at further tantalizing options, perhaps a future visit is in order. Take note, though: Lil Frankie's operates as a cash-only establishment. While they conveniently host an ATM on-site, I recommend coming prepared with cash in hand to streamline your experience.

In summary, Lil Frankie's is a must-visit for anyone craving authentic, delectable fare in a cozy, welcoming atmosphere. Just don't forget to swing by the cash machine first!",1
12204,"Title: A Community Vibe and Tasty Bites at Sidewalk Cafe

I recently attended an afternoon lunch event at Sidewalk Cafe to support a non-profit for the homeless. Though my visit was event-specific, I couldn't help but notice the welcoming East Village essence that permeated the place. The Sidewalk Cafe exudes a 'be yourself' atmosphere where regulars and newcomers alike blend into a convivial tapestry.

Having been there twice before, the familiar faces among the staff added a sense of community. On a bustling September Sunday, the bar brimmed with lively patrons, the kind of crowd you'd want to join for a drink, even if you're not inclined to imbibe.

Post-show, the seamless shift of energy from the backroom to the front indicated the patrons' appreciation for the venue. As for the food, the Caesar salad with chicken and seven spices tuna did not disappoint and warrant a return visit on their own.

In summary, Sidewalk Cafe is the perfect spot to gather friends for good tunes, laughs, scrumptious meals, and to simply unwind. It's an engaging space that invites you to stay, relax, and enjoy.",1

18268,"I recently indulged in a Lobster Roll for lunch delivered directly to my doorstep, and it was nothing short of delicious! Admittedly, the roll was a bit on the smaller side considering it was the standard size offered. However, what it lacked in size, it more than compensated for with a burst of delightful flavors. The blend of seasoning and fresh lobster was so captivating that I completely overlooked the addition of butter. Although I'm not an avid lobster roll eater and thus have limited comparisons, the experience was so enjoyable that I'm certainly inclined to order it again. Highly recommended for a flavor-packed seafood treat!",1
16925,"Title: A Sizzling and Enjoyable Experience at the Hotpot & BBQ Joint

My brother and I ventured into the world of hotpot and BBQ dining for lunch yesterday and came out delighted by the experience. The hotpot was a first for us, and the servers couldn't have been more accommodating, guiding us through the process with warmth and enthusiasm.

We indulged in an array of meats, finding ourselves gravitating more toward the BBQ side of things. The original soup base left our taste buds wanting, while the spicy variant added the kick we were looking for. Among the hotpot selections, the unexpected stars were the spam and fishballs, which turned out to be surprisingly satisfying.

However, the grill took center stage for us; the shrimp, mussels, and squid, lightly kissed with butter and garlic, were standouts. The flavors were spot on, and those items will be my go-to on future visits. The scallion pancake was another hit, particularly with the fun of mixing our own dipping sauces.

Admittedly, the steak and pork cuts weren't top-shelf, but they were more than adequate considering the reasonable price point. Value-wise, this place is a winner for a communal feast with loved ones.

I wholeheartedly recommend making a reservation to avoid the wait at this bustling spot. Next time, I'll be skipping the hotpot in favor of a full-on grill session, homing in on those delectable shrimp, mussels, and squid. A great deal for a merry gathering!",1
10921,"Title: An Impromptu Delight at The Boil

Last-minute dinner plans brought us to The Boil, fully prepared for a wait, but to our delight, we were swiftly seated behind the bar without any delay. Starving and eager, we opted for Dogfish Head IPA - a fantastic choice to soothe the heat from our main event, the shrimp boil.

Accompanying our spicy feast were Cajun fries and white rice, both excellent for tempering the boil's vigorous spice levels. The aromatic wave of butter and Old Bay was intoxicating as the waiter presented our meal in a bag brimming with succulent shrimp, potatoes, and corn, all basking in a garlic-rich sauce. Its sweet and spicy profile was expertly balanced, coating each shrimp perfectly.

Dining at The Boil is hands-on - no flatware, just plastic bibs, surgeon gloves, and a clear bag of shrimp to prevent any damage to our clothing. This tactile experience added to the enjoyment, making the meal memorable and fun.

In a nutshell, The Boil offers a fantastic dining experience with a superb beer selection and amiable staff. While I'd recommend visiting a location where reservations are an option for a more organized evening, I am already looking forward to my next visit.",1

The Happy Hour prices truly are unbeatable, making it a wise choice for budget-conscious diners looking to indulge. Arriving early ensured a cozy spot at the bar, and a table in the quieter area at the back. Accompanied by a variety of tasty appetizers, the affordable drinks provided a fantastic start to our night out. Highly recommended for a great vibe and even greater value.",1
17854,"While staying down by Wall Street we were looking for a spot for dinner close by. We found this place and decided to check it out. They have two massive bank vaults on both sides of the restaurant. They are quite impressive and have the history on them. The restaurant has a great ambience too. You can tell it's a happy hour spot that turns into a great dinner spot later. They have a regular full menu but also a great bar menu. Note that the bar menu is in the drink menu (we did not notice it at first). All the sliders are excellent, they're bite size so get a few. The steak tartare and burrata were excellent highly recommend them. The empanada is very good too. They also have great music playing in the background making it a fun atmosphere.",0

Price was marked as market price. It ended up $30 for me. It was mostly sour and slightly spicy curry with some soft shell crab. You can eat the soft shell crab completely without having to put the effort to break open the shell. I took fried bao on the side. Bao had a nice consistency and texture. For appetizer I went for murtabak. It was really good. It was roti stuffed with ground beef and egg, served with a side of curry.",0

I'm not the biggest fan of their soup, so always go with the salad. You'll be full after the lunch special, so make sure you come hungry.",0
18596,"Title: Basic Bites in Chinatown’s New Veggie Spot

During a leisurely stroll through Chinatown, my vegetarian companion and I were drawn to a new, brightly lit restaurant. Much to our surprise, it was not as new as it appeared, having opened its doors a few months prior. With reasonable pricing and a sizable menu, the establishment radiated welcome from the friendly staff.

However, this isn't your traditional culinary experience. The kitchen here seems almost unnecessary, as the menu largely consists of simple dishes that appear to be assembled rather than cooked—think minimal heat and a reliance on microwaves. The versatility of the menu comes from the mix-and-match approach with a common pool of ingredients.

Opting for a server's suggestion, I tried the vegan BBQ ribs. Complemented with brown rice, cashews, and steamed greens, the plate was a decent meal for about $8. My friend enjoyed the vegetarian dumplings, which were predictably fried and satisfying.

If you're seeking uncomplicated vegetarian or vegan fare, this spot offers a straightforward, nutritious meal without hurting your wallet. The use of processed vegan meat substitutes is notable, and while not a deal-breaker, let's just say curiosity lingers over their composition. They also offer vegan ice cream, though I didn't sample it.

In summary, this establishment is a solid choice for simple plant-based meals. However, for those craving innovative and authentically cooked dishes, it may fall short. A greater focus on fresh, original cooking rather than processed alternatives could elevate their game.",1
1556,"I visited Ippudo with high hopes for a great ramen experience but came away feeling that it was merely average, especially considering the price. I opted for the Akamaru Ramen at $16 and was disappointed to find it lacked an egg, which I consider essential to a good ramen dish. The noodles were adequately chewy, but frankly unremarkable. While the broth packed a flavorful punch, it verged on being excessively salty. The serving size didn't quite match up to the cost, and toppings were scant, consisting of just two slices of meat. In a city with a wealth of ramen offerings, I believe there are more satisfying options available.",1
20125,"Chef's Table proved to be the perfect choice for a special occasion. As anticipated with its three-star reputation, the culinary journey I embarked on was nothing short of extraordinary. Each dish provided a unique experience, with standouts like the sumptuous caviar, rich sea urchin, succulent langoustine, and the most tender Wagyu beef I have ever tasted. The frozen soufflé was an exceptional finale to the indulgent 14-course feast. Frequent visitors can take solace in the constancy of the signatures amidst the ever-changing menu. For those seeking an unforgettable dining adventure, Chef's Table certainly delivers.",1
12043,"Title: A Symphony of Flavors Complemented by Jazz at Local Gem

I recently discovered an extraordinary dining spot that I had been passing by for years, and now I can't believe I waited so long to step inside. From the moment I walked in, I was enveloped in a symphony of smooth jazz, the clink of wine glasses, and the buzz of happy diners—creating an ambiance that is as delightful as it is lively.

The salads at this establishment are a revelation—fresh, vibrant, and sourced from a farm in upstate New York. The divine combination of sweet, hydrating beets dressed in a simple vinaigrette is something I would recommend without hesitation, even to those who, like me, usually reserve salads for home meals.

For starters, the mussels were a hit, bathed in a luxurious sauce infused with garlic and shallots—an ideal appetizer to share. Although the menu is seasonal and these may not be a permanent fixture, their current presence is a testament to the kitchen’s commitment to freshness.

The entrees continued to impress. The salmon, which even won over my friend who typically shies away from stronger-flavored fish, was tender and complemented by a fragrant medley of sautéed onions and vegetables. The duck, a dish often avoided for its gamey reputation, was a savory masterpiece here, expertly cooked and reminiscent of a fine steak—sans the gamey taste.

Presentation throughout the meal was impeccable, a clear sign of a chef fully in command of their art. While the vibrant jazz backdrop may not suit everyone, I'd recommend this restaurant for romantic dates, a girls' night out, or an impressive spot for out-of-towners seeking a taste of local flair. Just a note: for those sensitive to noise, the live music may be a bit much, but for everyone else, it's pitch-perfect.",1

If there's a go-to spot for all-day British breakfast and lunch, this charming eatery is it. The ambiance immediately sets the stage for a unique culinary experience, with an atmosphere that's as delightful as the food. Their smashed avocado toast is a masterpiece; the rustic European toast provides the perfect canvas for the creamy avocado, punctuated with crunch from pistachios, tangy feta, and a perfectly poached egg. Simply put, it's divine. The Winter Breakfast also caught my eye, but the avocado smash shone as the star of the morning. And let's not forget the cappuccinos, which were executed with perfection. To cap it off, the ceiling mirrors add an unexpected but fantastic touch. In summary, this place is a must-visit where amazing seems to be the standard. Delicious, indeed!",1
11006,"I recently visited Vanessa's after returning from China, and my experience was deeply disappointing. The restaurant itself was cramped and unclean, making seating a frustrating endeavor. The bathroom conditions were especially appalling.

As for the food, it thoroughly underwhelmed me. The beef pancake resembled plastic, the edamame was smothered in an excessive amount of salt, and the dumplings, while passable, failed to live up to their spotlight on the menu. Additionally, the mango shake was overwhelmingly sweet and artificial in flavor.

Moreover, service was slow, taking over half an hour to receive a simple order of dumplings and edamame – an unacceptable wait time for such basic fare. With a plethora of superior dining options available in Chinatown for a similar cost, I would advise skipping Vanessa's despite its renown.",1
17399,"Title: A Culinary Tradition at Raclette

Every visit from my best friend warrants a celebration, and Raclette has become our go-to spot. The Mornay Mac & Cheese initiated our feast, striking the perfect balance between indulgence and portion size, ideal as an appetizer or a light entrée. Panko breadcrumbs added a gratifying texture to its exquisite taste.

The main course, Parisienne, featured a 7 oz pan-seared skirt steak, flawlessly cooked to medium rare, highlighting truffle cheese that elevated the dish to new heights. Accompanied by sautéed mushrooms, roasted asparagus, and potatoes, it was a symphony of flavors.

Our sweet indulgence included two desserts. The Deconstructed Crème Brulee with its lemon custard and mixed berries presented a refreshing twist on a classic, while the Blackberry-Thyme Cheesecake, a staple in my Raclette dining experience, remained consistently divine.

Raclette is more than a restaurant; it's an experience I eagerly anticipate. I'll continue dining here and recommend that you reserve your table in advance to avoid disappointment. It's a culinary gem that's not to be missed.",1

Finding this place was a little tricky, but once you found the right doorway and up the elevator you're going to find yourself in a Korean styled bar, full of wondrous food and drink. Came here with a reservation at 5pm for 3 people, bar just opened then so we got seated to our table. Our table ordered the following: bulgogi pentaco, spicy gojuchang fried chicken, passion fruit soju, apple mule, smoke manhattan, lychee martini (we ordered about 3 cocktails for each of us cant remember the specific names, not including the soju). Total bill came about just short of $150 tax and tip included, what a steal for a KoreaTown happy hour gem!Tip: come here 5pm-8pm, they have happy hour everyday! Do make a reservation on their website or through Resy, cause i could imagine this would be really popular among bar hoppers and korean food lovers!AMBIANCE:The bar was quiet when we came in since they just opened to customers, but the ambiance is nice. Love the vibes here and a chill atmosphere. Lots of tables and seating, love the decor. Entrance is kind of a hole in a wall place, and a little hard to find.PROS:Drinks were so good! Passion fruit soju was definitely unique since I haven't had that in other pochas or bars on the block. The drinks veer more towards the fruitier side, so do keep that in mind if that is more of your thing. Smoked Manhattan was really strong. Like really really strong of whiskey. You can tell they didn't water down their drinks. Lychee martini was fantastic, and they serve in a giant martini glass with big chunks of lychees to indulge in. Its a fantastic drink to get fancy with! Apple mule was also made really well.I LOVE the selection of drinks you can have, I counted at least 30+ drinks, cocktails, beers etc you can order on their happy hour menu, definitely one of the most generous in terms of selections you can have. Food wise there is maybe just as much!Fried chicken had a great heat and spice to it - it's a little bit saucier for my taste, but the chicken was well seasoned, moist, and incredibly tasty. There was a lot of chicken on this order, and they definitely did not skimp out on portions for their chicken. Pentaco was great too, and we opted for the beef bulgogi pentaco. The five tacos werer incredibly cute and pretty! Loved the touch of micro greens, and the sour onions and pickled vegetables paired really well with the beef bulgogi. Definitely recommend!

14575,"Stopped by on a Tuesday night to have dinner with friends and it was totally unplanned. As soon as you walk in you can't help to notice the ambiance and the beautifully lit bar area. We were immediately greeted and seated (party of 3). What I first loved about this place is that the hostess yells out (what I believe to be in Japanese) ""welcome!"" as he is seating us; which is followed by the rest of the staff responding ""welcome"" altogether. (One of the waiters explained this to us).As for the food, I got the chicken ramen. It was FULL of flavor; I could eat the broth alone if I had to! One of my friends got the same thing but swapped out the chicken for tofu; she enjoyed hers as well. There aren't many vegetarian/vegan options. All of the broths are either chicken or pork based.

11241,"Title: A Seafood Gem Just Steps from Times Square – Oceana Delivers

From the heart of the city’s excitement, a stone's throw away from Time Square, hides a culinary oasis known as Oceana. The restaurant promises a special dining experience and does not disappoint.

We arrived for our reservation and were promptly seated, immediately attended to by a waiter whose attentiveness made us feel truly valued. We commenced our meal with Alaskan King Crab legs, presented with an array of sauces; however, the cocktail sauce alone sufficed, accentuating the crab's intrinsic flavors within its generous portion.

Our mains included the Halibut and their signature burger. The Halibut, tender and delicately flaky, was elegantly simple. Requesting a substitution for the typical sides, I paired my fish with fries. The waiter, sensing an opportunity to enhance my dish, provided a complementary oil-based sauce—a pairing that proved to be a culinary triumph.

Not to be overshadowed, the burger was a revelation. Oceana is clearly dedicated to excellence across its menu, ensuring even non-seafood lovers leave impressed.

Oceana is not just a meal, it's an event—one that I wholeheartedly recommend. For those seeking a standout dining experience in NYC, Oceana is a must-visit. My gratitude abounds for this gastronomic pleasure, and I am eager to return.",1
12124,"During my recent visit to the grill-focused restaurant, the food quality was quite satisfactory. The five meats featured on the grill were notably fresh and cooked well, though the flavors were only moderately impressive. Accompanying the meat were decent side offerings including salad, buns, and rice balls, which nicely complemented the main course. Service deserves a positive mention—attentive and efficient throughout the meal.

Unfortunately, options for those who favor a diverse selection of vegetables were limited, as the focus is clearly on meats. Moreover, the pricing felt somewhat steep considering the quantity of meat served. It's worth noting that this establishment welcomes reservations for groups of four or more, which is convenient for planned outings. While the experience was generally good, the value proposition might be a concern for some diners.",1

Review:
I recently had the pleasure of visiting what I now consider the pinnacle of pizza perfection in NYC. As a fervent pizza enthusiast, I was blown away by the exceptional New York-style pie, characterized by its ultra-thin, delightfully crunchy crust that is a dream come true for crunch aficionados.

Celebrating Valentine's Day at this eatery was made extra special with their charming heart-shaped pizzas, a thoughtful and unique touch that truly set the mood. The opportunity to personalize our pizza with fresh herbs picked right from in-house planters elevated the experience and added a lovely burst of flavor.

The pizza here is a gastronomic revelation; it's not just about the cheese but rather a symphony of flavors, clearly the result of their masterfully crafted seasoning. The warm and engaging staff contributed to an overall stellar dining experience.

And to top it off, the efficiency was astounding—our pizza arrived in under 10 minutes, a feat that didn't sacrifice quality or taste. This place is a must-visit for anyone seeking a flavorful pizza adventure in the heart of New York City.",1
15572,We came here for my birthday dinner and it was absolutely delicious. The bread and dips they give you in the beginning are homemade and great.

There was a $42/pp restaurant week menu option but we decided to go a la carte because there were dishes we wanted to try not listed in the restaurant week option.MUST ORDER/EXCELLENT:1. Coconut rice - I genuinely think that was my favorite part of the dinner. As someone who loves Thai food I've had a lot of coconut rice in my lifetime but this one was unlike any other. So fragrant and so sweet! 2. Sizzling Sisig - I've had sisig once before and wanted to try it again. I thought the addition of the egg was nice and the meat had a great crisp and was flavored well. Be sure to take bites with the meat, egg and red pepper!3. Pork Belly Adobo - though the portion is relatively smaller than the other plates, this was probably my favorite bite (besides the coconut rice of course). The crisp of the skin is insane compared with the tenderness of the pork belly itself. And the poached egg works well to make a creamy sauce.GOOD BUT COULD SKIP:1. Green Papaya Salad - definitely wasn't bad but nothing stood out. tasted like a typical papaya salad2. Khao Soi - a traditional red curry noodle, I liked the crunchy noodles and the meat was tender but it wasn't a very unique dish. You can definitely get red curry with noodles elsewhere.Total per person came out to around $40Overall definitely going to go back again (I want to order more coconut rice!!)",0
18546,"Title: A Delectable KBBQ Experience at Love BBQ

As an aficionado of Korean BBQ, I've visited renowned spots like Jongro and Baekjong, but Love BBQ steals the crown as my current top pick. A Saturday night visit at prime dinner time, and to my delight, no wait – a testament to their spacious three-floor layout.

The ambiance impressed me right off the bat with a remarkably smoke-free environment, thanks to their ingenious side vented grills. My dining experience kicked off with a Cheese Dukbokki appetizer and a well-priced Pork Combo Set for two. Although the Dukbokki was missing a few menu-listed items, the gooey mozzarella topping more than made up for it.

The banchan spread was a delightful prelude, complete with an unexpected treat: a truffle-steamed egg that won over my usually indifferent palate. The pork jowl and belly were mouthwatering highlights, though the pork collar's leanness fell short on juiciness.

A slightly sweet kimchi stew added variety, differing from the typical sour tang yet remaining enjoyable. Service was a high point – attentive to the brink of excess. Our server managed the grilling with precision and politeness, without urging us to the next course. The table layout posed a minor challenge for personal space when meat was being cooked, but it was more a quirk of the setting than a flaw.

In summary, Love BBQ delivers on taste and service, distinguishing itself as a superior KBBQ destination. Definitely a place I'll be returning to and recommending.",1
17666,"The pizza was pretty decent however the service is top notch! This is the perfect place to go when you're in the area at a bar and need to 'Irish exit' for some quick grub. The gentlemen behind the counter are friendly, polite and hilarious. I ordered me a plain slice and a beef patty with cheese (New Year New Me diet starting soon). The dough was a bit thin for my personal taste but the sauce and cheese were plentiful. The beef patty was the classic New York beef patty and I probably would have ate two more if I wasn't pressed for time. If you're at the Gem, My Friend Duke, or just in the area and hangry for a slice, this is your spot.",0
17361,"I wanted to check this place out since I heard they were on the list for restaurant week. I came here for dinner expecting Becco it to be a pasta filled Italian restaurant - well do not expect that! They have a lot of delicious options on the many, however, very few of them are pasta. I have never been to an Italian place that only has 3 pasta dishes on the menu. Regardless my experience was still good! I started off with a glass of sav blanc and some delicious bread box. Their bread they give you right as you sit at the table is AMAZE! The bread sticks were my personal favorite. The bread is served with olives and an olive oil tomato hummus that was TO DIE FOR. Upon realizing this Italian place did not offer many pasta dishes, I searched for seafood or poultry options. I decided to go with the lamb for my meal. I also ordered the breaded shrimp with the spicy marinara sauce. I hate when restaurants list items as ""spicy"" and then when you eat it, it turns out to not be spicy at all - well this sauce was a pleasant surprise because it actually had a bit of a kick to it and it paired perfectly with the filet shrimp. I will definitely come back here after a great meal!",0
16323,"CASH ONLY!  When you think of NYC style pizza, Joe's Pizza is a staple spot to come hit the craving.  Most of the time, there is a line, but it moves pretty quickly.For $3, you can get yourself a tasty plain slice.  The pizza crust here is very thin and crispy -- yet the slice is chewy enough to savor that melted cheese over saucy perfection.There is limited seating inside with only a few barstools and counter top tables.  There's also no bathrooms available.  If you're looking to enjoy your pizza with a larger group, there's several parks nearby with benches.Come carb-o-load at Joe's.  It's a classic NY spot that everyone should try at least once!",0
16672,"Title: A Delightful Culinary Adventure at Atoboy

I recently visited Atoboy after catching wind of its rave reviews at a KCON panel, and the experience did not disappoint. Although the restaurant is on the cozier side and seating at the bar is less than ideal for a solo diner like me, the encounter with two fellow diners - a local food enthusiast and a South African yacht chef - enriched the evening with engaging conversation and bonus dining recommendations.

Opting for the three-dish menu at $46, I had mixed feelings about the leek with black truffle, cheddar, and buckwheat. While it was satisfactory, I heard whispers of an upcoming menu update for this particular dish, which might just elevate it to the standard of the other offerings. Conversely, the egg dish, served with rice and seaweed chips, was a delightful blend of rich flavors that truly hit the spot.

However, the kimchi side dishes weren't quite to my liking. But all was redeemed with the octopus dish – a standout creation featuring tender octopus with a sweet mango twist, all complemented by a tangy mojo verde and fermented dubu. It exemplified the innovative and progressive culinary spirit that Atoboy prides itself on.

Overall, Atoboy is a must-visit for the adventurous food lover. With each dish delivering a unique and memorable experience, I highly recommend this place with enthusiasm.",1
15342,"Title: A Quick Bite at the Green Falafel Bowl Spot

My first encounter with this eatery came via MealPal, and the green falafel bowl was my introduction. The dish presents a decent lunch option: falafel shaped into demispheres accompanied by tangy pickled onions and charred sweet potatoes, all sitting atop a bed of long-grain rice. The falafel itself leans towards the dry side, and while the sauce carries an intriguing hint of coconut, the kitchen tends to be heavy-handed with it, overshadowing the other components.

On the beverage front, the organic sparkling tea is a winner, especially the lime hibiscus flavor which outshines the tropical green tea—refreshing with zero calories. Despite some missteps with the sauce-to-bowl ratio, the restaurant certainly warrants a visit for those seeking a quick, health-conscious meal.",1
20071,"5 star brunch spot!  There's a solid selection of food and drinks, which changes thru the year.  Recently I got the fried chicken sandwich, which did not disappoint!  It's topped with jalapeño slaw, and for anyone worried-- it's not spicy at all.  We also had the pesto kale salad and the burratta-- both were amazing.  In addition to excellent food, the service is 1st class.  The server even brought us an extra order of circle fries to share!We plan on going back the next time we are in the city!",0
11775,"Title: Mixed Impressions at a Steakhouse

During my recent visit to a local steakhouse, I was greeted with exceptional service. The server stood out for their attentiveness and polite demeanor, adding to the pleasant atmosphere of the dining area, which I found both nice and spacious.

Among the starters, the oysters, served in a half dozen, were notably fresh and delectable, a real treat complemented by the classic pairing of bacon bits with crisp lettuce and tomatoes. However, my anticipation for the bread was met with disappointment as it arrived cold.

The entrée experience was a tale of two steaks. The Porterhouse, ordered medium rare, regrettably fell short of expectations; it lacked the succulence and juiciness that one looks forward to in a high-quality steak. Meanwhile, the Ribeye, though a step up, still did not deliver the depth of flavor I desired. The accompanying Pinot noir proved to be a decent selection, neither detracting from nor elevating the meal.

Reflecting on the experience and considering the competitive landscape of fine steakhouses, I am hesitant to return. The memory of a superior Porterhouse at Peter Luger—a restaurant I do not particularly favor—cast a shadow over Wolfgang's rendition. With so many options available, my quest for the perfect steak experience will likely lead me elsewhere.",1
17195,All the pastries look so warm and fluffy and fresh. It's hard to choose  just one because they all look so good. The options were simple. I also got a Matcha Latte and was a bland but not the worst Matcha I've had. Would try if you're in Chelsea Market!,0
12463,"I LOVE this place!! I'm a big fan of thin crust pizza, and Spunto does not disappoint, both on quality and taste. Don't get me started on the flavor and amount of toppings! I love that you're able to customize and order two different style pies as one (so half and half). I always get annoyed when pizza places barely cover their pies with toppings, but Spunto has outdone themselves, look at all those mushrooms! As for the taste, my new favorite has to be the Parma. Prosciutto chips AND their bacon, I've never tasted a pizza like this! It was a mix of sweet and savory, so so good! Hate to say it, but this definitely outshines John's of Bleeker St. Highly recommend a stop here if you're in the area!",0
16727,Outstanding service and staff. My family and I got seated right away (with reservations) and our waiter took our orders and the food arrived very quickly and all was delicious! The margarita was great and so were all the salads. The interior was beautifully decorated! Definitely recommend going here if you're in the area. So close to rooftop bars where you can go after for a great view of the city. Highly recommend this place although it is pretty pricey!,0
2635,"Discovering a new ramen haven in the StuyTown area was an unexpected delight. The exterior may deceive with its modest appearance, but step inside, and you're greeted with ample seating – a spacious retreat from the bustling cityscape.

At heart, this place celebrates ramen in its most exquisite form – no fuss, no unnecessary frills. I opted for a traditional bowl and was not disappointed. The broth was a revelation; clarity and depth in each spoonful, while the noodles had the kind of faultless texture that only true masters of the craft can consistently produce.

A pro tip for fellow ramen aficionados: elevate your experience by adding the egg. It's a small embellishment that enriches the whole bowl with its creamy, savory essence. This spot is a real gem for those in pursuit of ramen purity.",1
2978,I remember coming here ages ago and the place looked different so i think they must have had a revamp? Made a Friday night reservation via Seated which gave us additional perks. The process was pretty straightforward. We got here just before 7pm. Unfortunately we were not able to take advantage of the happy hour as we were not seated at the bar. They were nice enough to offer a seat at the bar but we declined as we were comfortable where we were. The happy hour is $1 oyster and also $7 wines although I was told you can only choose one or the other.  Either way we did not take advantage of it as we weren't able to. We ordered 3 pastas: Cacio e Pepe (came with the cheese wheel); truffle mushroom and their special of the day - black ink pasta with prawns. We also ordered eggplant parmigiana. We thoroughly enjoyed each dish and ate everything. That pasta was fresh and cooked just right. Bread and pesto was also provided before the meals came. All of this and two glasses of wine ended up costing $55 p/p and we received additional cashback via Seated app. Not a bad Friday night out to catch up with friends!,0
20161,"Title: A Taco Stand Above the Rest

I recently discovered a gem of a taco spot that has set a new standard for street tacos in my book. The carne asada and adobada tacos I tried were both exceptional – larger in size and bursting with savory flavors that tantalize the taste buds.

Despite the crowd and the queue stretching out the door, the experience was worth the wait. The ordering process is straightforward: you make your selection at the front, get your ticket, and pass it to the industrious cooks who prepare your meal right in front of you. Each taco is generously topped with the classic fixings – fresh cilantro, crisp onions, punchy salsa, creamy guacamole sauce, and for the adobada, a sweet touch of pineapple.

The ambiance is energetic, matching the quick pace of the service. Dining is a stand-up affair here, which keeps the vibe casual and the focus squarely on the delicious fare.

For anyone craving authentic street tacos that pack a punch and are satisfying in size, this is the place. Just be prepared to possibly line up for seconds – these tacos are addictive!",1
11617,"Title: Vegan Paradise at Bareburger

If you're on the prowl for a top-notch burger joint that caters wonderfully to vegans, look no further than Bareburger. With not one but five vegan patties, including Impossible and Beyond Meat, there's a mouth-watering option for every preference. I sunk my teeth into the Impossible Burger and was blown away by its flavor and satisfying heartiness – a true feast that left me perfectly sated.

The side of fries and a vegan shake complemented the meal beautifully, further elevating the dining experience. And the vegan delights didn't stop there – the all-vegan menu side is a testament to Bareburger's commitment to variety. From Tempeh Bacon to JustEgg, and an impressive selection of vegan cheeses, the choices are boundless. They've even added vegan hotdogs to their repertoire!

Pogibear and I were thrilled with the diversity and quality of the vegan offerings. It's refreshing to see a chain give such attention to plant-based items. Bareburger is quickly climbing the ranks in my book, and I'm already looking forward to my next visit.",1
2704,"Title: Prompt Service and Tasty Brunch with a Minor Mishap

I popped into this establishment looking to avoid the daunting 1-2 hour wait times prevalent during the three-day weekend rush. To my delight, seating was immediate, and the staff welcomed me with exceptional kindness. My taste buds were tantalized by the lobster eggs benedict paired with country potatoes - a truly savory delight. However, the experience was slightly marred when I crunched on an errant piece of lobster shell, momentarily mistaking it for a stone. While the departure process lagged due to the holiday crowd, the meal was, on the whole, satisfying. Despite the brief wait when settling the bill, I would recommend this spot for anyone seeking prompt service and a gratifying meal.",1
18010,"Title: A Hearty Start to the Day at a Bustling Brunch Spot

After placing our names on the waitlist—reservations aren’t part of the equation here—we were pleasantly surprised by the generous portions served at this bustling breakfast and brunch haven. The highlight for me was the avocado toast topped with a flawlessly poached egg, a dish that truly hit the spot. Accompanying my meal with a rich and satisfying matcha latte only added to the heartiness of the experience.

Service shone through with our waitress's warm and attentive demeanor, contributing to the overall positive ambiance. However, not everything was impeccable; our plain pancake fell short, presenting a disappointingly dry and bland experience that its fluffy appearance could not redeem. Perhaps another variety may have yielded a tastier outcome, but it remained the lone shadow on an otherwise delightful visit. Nonetheless, the overall satisfaction from the meal confirms this spot as an awesome choice for breakfast or brunch enthusiasts.",1
13920,"Title: A Slice of Heaven at Una Pizza Napoletana

As a self-proclaimed pizza connoisseur, I've scoured the city for the top slices, and my latest discovery—Una Pizza Napoletana on the Lower East Side—is a game-changer. This isn't just a pizza place; it's a temple to the art of the Neapolitan pie.

The ambiance strikes the perfect balance, boasting a clean, white interior with subtle lighting—elevating your focus to the culinary spectacle before you. At the heart of it all is a gleaming marble bar, but the true magic happens at the back. There you’ll find the master and owner, skillfully crafting each pizza with a dedication visible to every patron in the room.

Upon the first bite, it's clear that each ingredient is chosen for its quality and ability to harmonize with the others—the tomatoes burst with freshness, the salt is sprinkled with precision, and the cheese is nothing short of exceptional. But the star of the show is the crust: a perfectly soft chew that imprints the experience in your memory.

In a city brimming with pizza options, Una Pizza Napoletana stands out as a luxurious indulgence, one that is well worth the expense for those who are serious about their pizza game. If you haven't been, you're not just missing out on a pizza; you're missing out on a masterpiece.",1
16097,"My two friends and I just left here from having lunch. We've been here before around the time they first opened, and the service was good - food delish. This time around, I had the steak frites - friends had the club sandwich and BH burger. My steak was extremely chewy this time around, which is surprising because when I was here last - it was perfect. Friends said their food was good. Their fries are awesome - I love them. Although this time around, our server (think her name is Elena - dark hair in a ponytail served us upstairs) was horrible. Inattentive, attitude when we asked about our drinks that we ordered 15mins prior, and never came to check on us. As a matter of fact, after she brought said drinks, we never saw her again. We had to get a different server to bring it. I'm sure we'll be back - just won't sit upstairs I guess?",0
10853,"Title: A Unique Slice of History at Sparks

After an invigorating hike up Bear Mountain, my appetite led me to Sparks, a stone's throw from where the bus dropped me off. Anticipating a touch of history as much as a meal, this storied establishment did not disappoint. Sparks eschews the modern flair of its mid-town counterparts for a traditionalist charm—think subdued lighting, porcelain, and comforting pastoral scenes adorning the walls, all punctuated by the unexpected vibrancy of sports broadcasting from twin TVs at the bar.

The staff at Sparks brings a personable edge to the upscale dining experience, blending the professionalism of a high-end steakhouse with the casual banter synonymous with a local dive bar—although witnessing staff squabbles over orders was more entertainment than expected!

The cuisine is certainly up to par, with highlights including a sumptuous Sirloin Steak and a delectable cheesecake. However, prices are steep, and the value proposition becomes hazy, especially when a $60 steak or a $100+ bottle of wine is on the line.

Sparks provided the memorable experience I craved, rich with a distinct character and historical ambiance. Nevertheless, the premium cost is a deterrent for future visits, reserving this venue for the occasional indulgence rather than a regular haunt.",1
2016,"**Title: A Spicy Surprise Without the Burn - A Lunch to Remember**

As a self-proclaimed spice wimp, I approached the renowned authentic Indian restaurant my colleagues raved about with a mix of curiosity and trepidation. But my culinary caution was unfounded in the best possible way. This gem offers a diverse lunch buffet that caters to all palates - from spice aficionados to those like me, who prefer to keep it mild.

The variety was stunning – over 15 trays of mouth-watering options, plus extras served as we dined. The cuisine was an uncharted yet delightful territory for my taste buds; each dish was a revelation. While I cannot recount the names of these treats, the spread included choices for vegans, vegetarians, meat-eaters, gluten-free diets, and both heat-seekers and avoiders alike.

Aside from the exceptional food, the service was equally impressive. The staff's warmth and dedication to ensuring our lunch was memorable shone through with every interaction.

As I look forward to my next visit, I’m determined to familiarize myself with the dish names to do justice to this culinary experience in future reviews. For now, suffice it to say, this place is a must-visit - your stomach will thank you, and your taste buds will applaud your bravery.",1
11229,"My friend grabbed reservations for Atoboy about a week in advance. He described it as Korean inspired banchan. I didn't think this did Atoboy justice. While I did not have high expectations going in, each successive course blew me away. I've had my fair share of Korean food when living in Southern California. Atoboy's dishes are far from standard Korean dishes.  The interior of Atoboy is pretty minimalist with rustic dining tables. That same philosophy is in their menu which consists of 3 sections with 5 dishes each for $46/person. Each person gets a choice of white rice or special rice (extra charge). Each person can choose 1 selection from each section. If you're hungry, you can also add from the a la carte menu. You will want to eat family style here. We had a party of three so we only got to try a few of the dishes in each section. Ideally, come with four to try most of the dishes. We got the following: 1) Cabbage, Crab, Yellow Tail2) Sunchoke, Pork & Shrimp, Egg w/ Uni3) Skate, Pork Belly, GalbiDessert) Sujeonggwa Granita, Pumpkin Cheesecake We were served seaweed chips as a snack to go with our appetizers. All three in section 1 were light and refreshing to start the meal but my favorite was combining the crab with the seaweed chips! In section 2 I would definitely recommend the egg w/ uni and the sunchoke, which is an oyster mushroom w/ black truffle and orange. The pork & shrimp is pretty standard - good but you can get that elsewhere. In section 3, we I would recommend the skate and the pork belly as a close second. The galbi dish you can also get elsewhere. Skip if you need to. The gochugaru flakes really add flavor to the otherwise neutral-tasting skate. The black bean is a nice touch on top. The pork belly was extremely tender and went well with the enoki mushrooms. While I normally don't order dessert at a restaurant, we ended up getting some here. The Sujeonggwa granita, a Korean drink transformed into a granita over burrata and walnut, was a great finish to a fantastic meal. Refreshing, not too sweet and yet another unique dish at Atoboy. This is a must-try even if you're not big on desserts. I would go back just for the granita. If you can't tell, I highly recommend this spot! Great for dates or small groups.",0

15574,"My visit to La Mela was nothing short of delightful. Arriving at 9pm on a Thursday, we were immediately seated without a wait. The service was efficient yet brisk, providing us with prompt attention. The culinary highlights included a succulent NY Strip Steak and a perfectly prepared Eggplant Parm. Our meal was made even more memorable by the surprise appearance of a band serenading us with festive Christmas tunes as we finished dining. Overall, it was a fantastic dining experience that I would highly recommend.",1
13595,"Title: A Reliable Spot with Perks and Celebrity Sightings

I recently revisited an old favorite that has been a local mainstay for years, which speaks volumes about its reputation. Although prices lean towards the higher end, the food portions and sharing options make it manageable for a tighter budget. My daughter and I enjoyed splitting a hearty chicken salad, and she couldn't resist adding a side of bacon – her favorite!

The ambiance was pleasant, especially at our window-side table which allowed for some people-watching and added to the experience. Service could have been a tad more attentive; we struggled to catch our waiter’s eye and ultimately had to bring in the manager to assist us. However, this hiccup was somewhat offset by the rewarding online program – sign up with your credit card for some worthwhile perks.

An added thrill to our meal was noticing Meghan Kelly casually dining in the corner, reminding us just how cool New York can be with its nonchalant celebrity presence. Despite the slight service snag, this place maintains its charm and dependability.",1
11316,"During my recent visit to a local Vietnamese restaurant, my experience was a mixed bag. On the plus side, the spring roll vermicelli was quite satisfactory – it offered the flavors you'd expect and came paired with the customary fish sauce, although I must admit that I'm not the biggest advocate for the sauce.

My eagerness to enjoy their offerings was slightly dampened by the catfish, which was sadly lacking in freshness. It had that unmistakable texture that suggested it had been stored in a refrigerator for too long, resulting in a rubbery disappointment.

In terms of the atmosphere, the restaurant certainly attracts a crowd, but I couldn't help but notice that the service did not exude the warmth and friendliness typically associated with Vietnamese eateries I've frequented. 

I'd rate my overall experience at a fair 3.5 out of 5. While the vermicelli was a hit, the catfish missed the mark, and the service could use a touch of hospitality to elevate the dining experience.",1
20676,"Choosing an Afternoon Tea in New York can be a task. Only because there are so many place in the city that offer Afternoon Tea at different varieties. Now if you know me, you know that I LOVE having tea and have done so in places such as The Ritz in London, Balmoral in Edinburgh and other spectacular places. I am also a fan of a 'Palm Court'. There are not many left in the world besides the two I just named in London, Edinburgh as well as The Plaza in NYC. Choosing to have Afternoon Tea inside the Palm Court at The Plaza was a no brainer.This was a special Tea as it was a Congratulation Tea for my daughter, as she had just graduated college. It is also a personal experience that I have shared with her for a decade or so. The Plaza did not disappoint with the Tea Service, the attentive staff and the little special touches. Yes it is pricey, especially if you do the Champange Tea which we did but you cannot put a price on experiences like this. Having Tea in locations such as The Plaza you expect those little touches that take it up a couple notches.From the time we were seated until the time we left, having tea with all the lovely little bits was wonderful. The champagne offered with tea is Veuve Cliquot which is a great way to upgrade! There are many different teas to choose from and if you have questions, they are there to help you select. As for the food, everything was great- the scones, the variety of savories and the delicious sweets at the end. We really enjoyed everything!The thoughtfulness of The Plaza was the Congratulations Macaron Plate that was brought out for my daughter. She was surprised as well as myself, lovely touch! We were also each gifted with a slice of their fruit cake in a gold take away box, The Plaza pens and souvenir post cards. I would most definitely have Afternoon Tea here again... and again!",0
3410,"This experience was a solid 3.5 stars for me but their service was weird and nonexistent at certain points which is why I'm giving it three stars. My family and I came in for dinner recently. We ordered many items from the menu, a lot of which were pretty good (the tuna was excellent, as was the beet tortilla) and others which were not (crab was a total miss). The duck is their signature dish and for good reason. It is excellent and a huge portion. This was enough for the entire table and we had five people. We also ordered a fish entree and the quail. I liked the quail but the fish was forgettable. In terms of dessert, the corn merengue is surprisingly tasty. It might be the best merengue I've ever tasted. We also ordered the chocolate dessert which I liked the most, since I love all things chocolate. We also got a complimentary fruit cake which was one of the most disguising things I've ever tasted. I know that is harsh but I couldn't even swallow it. It was a weird combination of flavors. If the owners are reading this and contemplating putting this on the menu, please don't. The service was lackluster and our waiter basically disappeared after the appetizers and came back half an hour later with our entrees. They didn't do a great job at explaining what the dishes consisted of and weren't very friendly either. I would come back for brunch, I think, and hopefully raise my rating.",0

I recently visited this downtown Manhattan eatery for a brunch gathering with friends and was charmed by its cozy ambiance and the bonus of live music near the bar which elevated the experience. The service was attentive and courteous, making us feel well taken care of throughout the meal.

The French toast I ordered was delectably sweet and hit the right notes for my taste buds. However, it was a bit light on portion size, leaving me a tad hungry afterward. Despite that, the overall experience was enjoyable, and the place left a good impression.

I'm intrigued by their Happy Hour and would definitely consider coming back to try it out next time I'm in the city. For now, I'm off to satisfy my remaining hunger with some noodle soup. Highly recommend for a relaxed brunch spot with good vibes and music!",1

I came with a group of 5 and was told the wait would be around 45 minutes to an hour on a Saturday night around 8pm. We went to a bar across the street while we waited so we wouldn't be bored since the restaurant is small and there's no waiting area.We were finally seated close to 9PM. I ordered the Niku Udon, which consists of beef short ribs and honeycomb tripe. The broth was light, a little sweet with a good amount of saltiness - super flavorful; short ribs were SOOOO tender; noodles were soft and chewy; and the tripe was slow-cooked perfectly. Raku needs to have an establishment in California because their udons are perfect for cold days. Otherwise, I will definitely be back! **CASH ONLY**",0

Review:

Despite the bustling line and chic crowd at this trendy café, the dining experience fell short of expectations, especially considering the steep prices. The ambiance is undeniably attractive with an open, airy atmosphere that undoubtedly charms the social media enthusiasts.

On to the crucial part - the food. Both the BLAT and the mozzarella-pesto sandwich that my sister and I tried were decent, yet they didn't leave a lasting impression to justify the $14 price tag. As for the $10 banana bread, it arrived as a thinly sliced disappointment, garnished with an odd-tasting spread that failed to impress.

In summary, the cost doesn't mirror the quality of the offerings. I believe in getting value for my money, and unfortunately, this restaurant doesn't make the cut. A return visit isn't on the table.",1
18337,"Some of the most lackluster, bland korean food ive ever eaten in my life, why the high rating of this place? Ill never know yelp......ill never know......maybe cause its the only korean option around this neck of the woods? Or maybe the masses around here have never eaten korean food before. Anyway i ordered the short rib bibimbop. The gochuchang was sour and tasted spoiled for some reason, the short rib did not have any taste to it and tasted incredibly cheap and tough for the premium i paid for it. The dish was not memorable at all and didnt warrant the price i paid for it. This place is not a good example of what korean food should taste like.",0
2652,"Title: A Brunch Haven in Chelsea - Not to be Missed!

I am in complete adoration of this delightful brunch spot, which earns a solid 4.5 out of 5 stars in my book. A true testament to its excellence is how often it’s bustling with patrons; reservations are a must, so thank the culinary gods for OpenTable.

The menu sings with freshness, embodying a farm-to-table philosophy that translates to every bite. The orange and ricotta pancakes, priced at $20, are the crown jewels of breakfast sweets - ethereally light, mildly sweet, and absolutely worth sharing. Equally impressive are the whole wheat steak wrap and the super greens egg white omelette, each at $19 and $20 respectively, both satisfying in portion and taste.

A gem among the baked goods is the $7 pistachio and cardamom bread, a unique and memorable treat. Prices may tip towards the higher end, with entrees averaging $18-20, but the value speaks in the quality and flavor of the food.

Service never falters, maintaining its 5-star quality even when the place is packed. The decor complements the dining experience with a 4.5 rating, creating a perfect brunch atmosphere.

From the phenomenal dishes to the impeccable service, this Chelsea hotspot deserves the highest recommendation for brunch enthusiasts.",1
18651,Found this place due to yelp of course! Met a friend here for drinks and dessert. This spot is super instagramable/ influencer spot.

I'd come back to try other items.,0
1260,"Title: A Mixed Experience with a Vegan Twist

Upon a trusted vegan friend's recommendation, my curiosity led me to this quaint little spot I'd been eager to try. Its size was unexpectedly modest, but the personal touch of table service added a cozy flair. The ambience was set to the smooth tunes of artists like Khalid, which I thoroughly enjoyed.

Our server was a highlight, exuding warmth and attentiveness without hovering too close. The vacant nature of the restaurant meant our meal arrived with haste – a pleasant bonus. Our shared choice, the Sweet Tree sushi, was a definite hit. Each piece was a melt-in-your-mouth delight, and it alone merits a return visit.

However, not all was impeccable. The adventure continued with our noodle soups – Miso and Coconut Curry. Opting for the recommended ramen option, we were met with overcooked noodles that lacked the desired bite. My miso broth ventured too far into the salty spectrum, overshadowing its potential umami charm. Both our bowls remained unfinished, a testament to our dissatisfaction.

In summary, while the noodle soups were a letdown, the impeccable service and sublime sushi earned the restaurant four stars in my book. A return trip is on the horizon, but I'll be steering clear of the soups next time around.",1
1572,"I recently visited this gem of a spot with friends after work and what a delight it was! The highlight was certainly the flight of five top-notch beers, though the massive steins – yes, up to 2 liters, even in the shape of a boot! – were quite the conversation starters. The happy hour deal, with the Original 1L beer at half price starting at 7 PM, was a steal.

Adding to the charm was the live music and swing dancing that kicked off just before 7, making Mondays here extra special. It's more than just a meal; it's a show. The interior is tastefully decorated, complete with a stunning sunroof that brightens the atmosphere.

Though it was too chilly to enjoy the deck this time around, it looked inviting, and I'm already planning a return visit once the weather warms up. Whether you're here for the beer, the dancing, or just a lively evening out, this place is sure to surprise and entertain.",1
16979,"During our visit for the Restaurant Week, we opted to try both the advertised lunch deal ($26) and the slightly pricier Prix Fixe menu ($32). The latter proved to be the standout choice, offering superior value for the cost.

Our meal commenced with delightfully fresh, warm bread paired with exceptionally creamy butter. For starters, the lobster bisque was a highlight with its rich flavor, the spicy shrimp with garlic was notably satisfying, and the steak house salad was plentiful enough to share.

Both the petite fillet and the 12oz New York strip were stellar entrees—perfectly cooked, well-seasoned, and oozing with juiciness. However, the side dishes of sweet potato and creamed spinach fell short; the sweetness of the potato was a tad overpowering and the spinach lacked the anticipated creaminess.

The meal ended on a positive note with a modest but enjoyable serving of bread pudding. Despite the minor setbacks with the sides, the overall experience was delightful enough that we'd readily return for the Prix Fixe menu, albeit with different expectations for Restaurant Week offerings.",1
18099,"This is a charming, one of a kind place! The gypsy river mocktail is hands down one of the best I have ever tasted. Also the Cubano is also a great sandwich to pick!

15707,"Interesting food - Asian Tapas is what I would call it. Lots of small dishes to be shred while you are drinking good booze. This is what to do here.Staff is very friendly, they let us hang out and drain our bottle of sake in the vestibule under the EXIT sign while we wait for space at the bar.Kimchi Paella definitely hits the mark, Eel Taco is a riot of flavor, Korean Popcorn Chicken goes well with beer,a the Soft Shell Crab is pretty hard to screw up. This is what I remember - it was a real boozy night. Good prices for Sake and Wine.There were few tourists trying to score some really weird alcoholic drink that looks like bubble tea. Apparently it's a thing.",0
14090,"TLDR: Flatiron Italian seafood restaurant. This is the more casual restaurant of Chef Michael White of Ai Fiori and Marea. Perfect for that glass of wine and a bowl of pasta that just whisks you away.This is a very pretty restaurant. It reminded me a bit of Upland but more chic and less country. Anyhoo, it's very easy to book a table here - just hop on Resy.The crudo items are excellent but the pastas are definitely what stood out to me. This was also true at Ai Fiori and Marea. I love that they have unique pasta shapes here, not just the standard spaghetti/linguini. What they're probably most known for is the Malfaldine Scampi. Starchy ribbons of pasta tossed in read crumbs, savory shrimp, garlic and oh - just so lovely. My other favorite is the Lumache which is kind of like a curved mezzi rigatoni. Their iteration is a razor clam pesto which is very unique but so so good. I've also had the branzino which was perfect, tender flakiness with that crispy skin.All in all, Scampi is a welcome addition to the area which is already full of great options.",0
14230,"Title: A Reassuring Return to Areppas Gramercy

I recently gave Areppas another chance, this time at their Gramercy location, and I'm glad I did. My initial experience at their Upper East Side spot left much to be desired, but the staff at Gramercy went above and beyond to enhance my experience.

The tequeños were a warm welcome back, oozing with cheese and served at the perfect temperature for that satisfying cheese pull. As for the arepas, I ordered a trio, including the Brooklyn, Reina Pepiada, and the Downtown. The Brooklyn was a repeat order, this time for my vegetarian friend, who thoroughly enjoyed its flavors.

The Reina Pepiada resembled a delightful chicken salad housed within a fresh arepa—a savory treat. Meanwhile, the Downtown arepa made a comeback from my previous disappointment, arriving hot with flavorful meat, completely turning my opinion around.

I found myself quite full, happily packing the leftovers for my mom. The quality and freshness of the food this time were in line with what you'd expect from a top-notch restaurant. I'm already looking forward to my next visit to Areppas in Gramercy.",1

1142,"Title: Authentic Tacos in a Lively Atmosphere!

My friends and I recently visited this little gem in search of authentic tacos and, trust me, we were not let down! Each taco was bursting with authentic flavors that had our palates dancing. We'd have loved to explore more of the menu, but our appetites were somewhat sated from a prior stop.

The vibe of the place is a party in itself—boisterous music, a merry cluster of TVs, and vibrant decor that adds to the festiveness. It's a small spot, so there's a heads-up: you might encounter a wait during peak times. Luck was on our side, and we snagged a table without delay.

I'm already looking forward to returning for another fun night of tacos paired with drinks. It's the ideal spot for a group hangout, where the food and the atmosphere promise a great time. Highly recommended!",1
19634,I always want to like this place but every single time they drop the ball. The food is always 3/10. Let me also add that they charged us $4 for a spicy rim on our spicy margarita - not to mention he didn't even tell us it was and extra charge? Ruben could have done better. Come here if you're drunk and can't taste anything I guess.,0
1293,"We came to Ocean Prime back on the first week of December to celebrate my boyfriends birthday. We did not have a reservation, and a lot of companies were having their holiday parties in multiple steakhouses so we were lucky to have ate here. I told the hostess I did not have a reservation and told me I would have to wait at least 40 mins but at least it was not a no- so we waited by the bar, got a drink and within 15 mins, we got seated! We sat on the upper level outside a larger party room and the level where the bathroom was- despite all the people walking back and forth, I didn't mind it. It was still more quiet than the main dining room. I was pretty hungry so I was ready to order- for appetizer we got a surf n turf to share which came with two seared scallops, braised short ribs and mashed potatoes. It was pretttty good. For mains, my boyfriend got the surf n turf which comes with lobster tail, 8 oz filet mignon and some sides. I wanted ribeye and decided to get 16 oz which I couldnt finish. My ribeye was pretty delicious- I asked for medium and I ate close to half before I started feeling full. The surf n turf I think is where I'd take a star away- the lobster tail was taken off the shell and looked unappetizing. Taste I guess was okay but for something so costly, I'd imagine the presentation to be as nice as possible as well. For the sides, we had creamed spinach and the texture of this was not what I am used to. It was less creamy than what I had in the past but it wasn't bad. Probably won't order this again but it was nice to try. We also got a side of truffle fries which was pretty good. Overall, the food was pretty decent. Service was okay. This restaurant is definitely on the expensive side but considering the location (rockerfeller) it was worth the experience and try.",0
19022,"Tucked just around the corner from the office, my coworker and I decided to grab lunch at this bustling spot. Despite the long queue that formed shortly after we were seated, the wait was worth it. Their Crab soup dumplings stood out with robust flavor and a resilient skin that held the generous amount of soup splendidly. The Scallion pancake with beef was another highlight, served fresh, hot, and perfectly crisp, while the thin layer of bean paste complemented the beef impeccably.

We also tried the Chive and egg pocket, which was both tasty and juicy—a simple but satisfying choice. For those who can handle a bit of heat, the Beef hotpot bowl is a must-try; the spicy option provided a zesty kick without being overpowering, and the bowl itself was hearty, with a pleasing mix of clear noodles, vegetables, tofu, and tender, fatty beef.

The Pan fried pork dumplings, however, fell short of expectations with their overly thick skin and lack of crispiness, despite the tasty filling.

Service faltered slightly under the lunchtime rush; bowl requests were forgotten, and flagging down staff for the bill proved challenging. Be aware that a 15% service fee is automatically included in the bill, a detail not to be overlooked. Overall, this spot is worth the visit for its standout dishes and convenient location.",1
14015,"I recently visited this spot for a poke bowl and was thoroughly impressed. The variety of options was fantastic, allowing for a tailored meal to suit any preference. The counter service was friendly and efficient, making for an easy dining experience. The portions were generous, providing good value for the price. I left satisfied and would definitely return for another meal. Highly recommended for poke lovers!",1
20342,"The only reasons I'm giving this 4 stars is because I wasn't really a fan of the sauce on my chilaquiles in comparison to other sauces I've had (although I imagine it was probably more authentic) and there was just too much ladled on there and the food took a while to make. Other than that it was delicious. It is a $10 minimum for credit cards but if you get a fresh squeezed juice, you will make up the difference with whatever meal you get. I HIGHLY recommend the sobrepeso juice (cactus, pineapple, something else). Holy crap, The was the best thing I've ever tasted. I could've had that alone and been happy. It completely made up for the chilaquiles and they squeeze the juice fast. You should try it!",0

16504,"Pretty basic menu (and service). We were originally seated right next to the bussing station, even though the place was relatively empty, and had to yell over the sound of plates/utensils being thrown into the bin.

And even after I showed her where we were going to move, we still had to flag down our waiter with our food and drinks afterwards. My onion soup was good, my moms omelette was good but cold.

17642,"Title: Unforgettable Ramen Experience at Ichiran!

If you're scouring New York for the ultimate ramen bowl, your search ends at Ichiran. This isn't just food; it's a culinary revelation. Their Recommended Set is a gateway to bliss, but for the adventurous soul, customizing your bowl adds intrigue.

Food is a solid 10/10. With noodles that strike the perfect balance between firm and tender, along with the transformative Hiden no Tare sauce, Ichiran delivers complexity in a bowl.

In terms of price and portion, I'd say 8/10. It might tip the scale slightly heavier on your wallet compared to other local joints, but the unparalleled quality and overall experience more than justify the cost.

Service at Ichiran stands out with a 9/10. It's all about you and your ramen in that personal booth. Simple button presses summon swift service without the usual chatter—ideal for the noodle enthusiast who prefers minimal distraction.

The ambience? Another 9/10. It's apparent that Ichiran values the dining experience. The setup ensures that each visitor can savor every slurp in peace, making the food the undisputed star of the show.

1530,"I'm a little shocked to see how many people are saying this is a racist and homophobic bar. The four of us (all asian) came here and couldn't be happier with our experience. Our friends are gay and were not discriminated in any way during our visit here. The bouncer was friendly and checked our IDs with no problems before letting us in. I found it funny and interesting that the sign outside this bar is of ""Psychic"" instead... Our friend took us here impromptu with no background information. So when our uber pulled over and I saw we were heading to a psychic, at first I thought my friend was just being funny by taking us to a palm reader of some kind. He just acted cool even when we entered the establishment and the first thing we saw was the psychic lady with her crystal ball. She was just finishing up with another client and looked very convincing, so I really thought we were going to see a psychic for fun and there was a built-up excitement in me to be honest.Alas, an attractive woman walked up to us and told us that we should head to the dining area at the back since the bar was full and standing room only. We agreed and sat in the quaint dining area. They had to move tables around since the space was tight. We really love the interior and the decoration! The waitresses have that beautiful-gypsy attire and carry a mysterious but charming aura with them. They were very sweet and attentive to us. My husband and our friends were sure happy checking the girls out. We ordered the Bone Marrow Poppers (yummy!) and my husband got the Duck Confit which I took a few bites of.. it was delicious, but a little fishy (just like some duck meats do) and the portion was small for the price. Each of us got 2-3 rounds of drinks. Drinks were quite good and refreshing. We really enjoyed our time there. A lot of couples on a romantic date too around us. It was an enjoyable and chic atmosphere, very pleasant visit. And oh yeah forgot to mention, there are some nude photos of women with a classy spin in the bathroom too.",0
10001,"I recently visited a local restaurant keen on sampling a variety of dishes through their 3 mezze option. Unfortunately, what should have been a flavorful exploration turned into a rather bland disappointment. First up was the Jaffa Hummus, which, while served with deliciously fresh bread, featured full chickpeas that resulted in a grainy texture and a hummus devoid of much-needed zest. Then there was the Roasted Cauliflower - not quite the freshly roasted delight one would expect, but rather a lukewarm dish that seemed pre-made and merely dressed up with tahini and nuts before serving. The cauliflower itself was underwhelming. Lastly, the Roasted Avocado could only be described as uninspired: half an avocado plainly roasted with a drizzle of olive oil, serving up more yawns than yum. If the mezze were meant to be a teaser of their culinary skills, the main courses—by extrapolation—might not be worth the gamble. In all, a forgettable meal with a distinct absence of the robust flavors I had anticipated.",1
13195,"During a bustling Valentine's weekend, we were seated within 30 minutes at the restaurant, despite a bit of awkward loitering by the entrance. The staff radiated warmth and friendliness even though their communication with the kitchen seemed slightly off-kilter.

We chose the Omakase experience at the bar, which did not disappoint. It was a culinary journey, made even sweeter by an unexpected dessert finale. The highlight was the personalized touch from the chef, who delighted us with a complimentary sushi, enhancing the sense of occasion.

The standout dish, a sublime blend of uni, toro, and caviar, left a lasting impression. This dining experience, punctuated by unexpected generosity and exceptional flavors, was a Valentine's to remember.",1

The spring roll hit the mark, but the chicken pho didn’t quite live up to my expectations—it lacked the rich flavor profile I was hoping for. Meanwhile, my coworker was quite satisfied with their beef pho, suggesting it might be the better choice here. I’m torn between a solid three and a four-star rating, wishing for a 3.5 to accurately reflect my experience. There's potential for a revisit, as I’m curious to see if the beef pho can elevate my opinion of the place.",1
12296,"It's been a while since I've had kbbq and I couldn't justify eating all the calories I can have in a day on one meal. Prior to my reservation, I did a heck lot of cardio and wow was this restaurant worth it. Everything I ordered was up to par and I couldn't ask for it to be any better. Their ban chans were great and of course, refilled without us asking. The food came out quickly and they cooked it perfectly in front of us. Our water cups never reached nearly empty and they kept refilling it after we finished our meal. We were a group of 10 and they split us into two tables. For 4, we ordered a meat set, tofu stew, and their house pancake. Their pancake was very different compared to all the Korean pancakes where it was eggier and less doughy. It was a very unique blend of an omelette and pancake.  As for the stew, this is probably the first time I enjoyed it on the same day. I usually don't appreciate the taste of the stew until the following day but this stew did not just taste like red pepper paste. It actually had a perfect blend of meat and seafood taste. As for the meats, of course, the amount of meat is the rate-limiting factor but that is actually a good thing because that frees up space in your belly to try more items instead of blowing it on expensive red meat. An interesting observation is that they don't serve the meat with a bunch of greens to make wraps. Overall, great meal.",0
18248,"Title: A Delightful Splurge at Uluh

My recent visit to Uluh, an upscale Chinese restaurant, was an exquisite experience that is well worth the splurge. The menu was a delightful journey through Chinese culinary artistry. We indulged in a variety of dishes, including pig trotters, beautifully seasoned eggplants laced with cilantro—my personal favorite—alongside cumin beef and irresistibly flaky scallion pancakes topped with sliced beef. The star of the evening, however, could have been the Peking duck with its perfectly crispy skin, a twist on the traditional recipe that still managed to impress our palates.

Admittedly, this level of quality and ambiance does come at a premium, with our group of four each paying approximately $40-50. However, for those seeking an evening of indulgence, the price is justified by the exceptional flavors and elegant setting. 

To top off the experience, we were seated without delay even during a busy dinner service—a rare convenience that might change as word spreads about this gem. And for those who appreciate a touch of modern luxury, the fancy Japanese bidet toilets in their spacious restrooms add an extra touch of comfort to the whole experience.

In conclusion, Uluh is a must-visit for anyone looking to treat themselves to an upscale take on Chinese cuisine in a beautiful and accommodating environment.",1

Needed a knife to cut it apart but good luck figuring out where to cut.For ramen I got the spicy miso since they were out of the milk and hops ramen.

15484,"Title: A Spicy Delight for Ramen Aficionados

If you're in NY searching for exceptional ramen without breaking the bank, look no further. This gem offers a sublime bowl of Kimchi Ramen that will satisfy any spicy food enthusiast. The flavors are intense, the savory notes hit just the right spot, and at $14 a bowl, it's a steal in the city's ramen scene.

My companion opted for the tsukemen and a side of tuna salad. While he found the pork in the tsukemen on the tougher side, the broth was spot-on, and the salad was refreshing and well-priced at about $12, earning his recommendation.

A word of caution: this place buzzes with energy and noise at lunchtime, so if you prefer a quieter dining experience, plan accordingly. Despite the din, it remains a top spot for a hearty and delicious ramen fix.",1
16248,"Title: A Sustainable Symphony of Flavors

From the moment we walked in, the restaurant captivated us with its commitment to sustainability, offering a menu brimming with sustainably sourced fish. But it wasn't just the eco-conscious approach that impressed us — it was the transformation of these ingredients into extraordinary culinary creations that truly took our breath away.

The chefs here are artisans of flavor, carefully selecting ingredients and pairing them in ways that elevate the dining experience to the realm of the sublime. Even the fish dishes that typically linger at the bottom of my preference list blossomed into new favorites, astonishing my palate and leaving me craving for more.

The sashimi was, without a hint of exaggeration, the best I've ever savored. Each slice was a testament to the chef's mastery, as well as to the restaurant's dedication to the quality and freshness of their fare.

Speaking of the chef, his geniality added a special touch to our evening. Coupled with a server who anticipated every need with seamless precision, the duo ensured that our experience was nothing short of exceptional. Despite each dish being prepared meticulously to order, service was prompt, making the wait a part of the pleasure.

This establishment is more than a restaurant; it's a culinary haven where every minute and penny is justified. An intimate atmosphere and a profound connection to the food are what you'll find here, an experience that resonates long after the last course is devoured. Thank you for an unforgettable dining journey.",1

12366,"Title: Bistango - A Mixed Bag Just Blocks Away

I recently decided to try delivery from Bistango, a local spot just two blocks from my home. My girlfriend's choice, the Pizzette Bianco Zucchini Corn ($18.00), though flavorful with ricotta, corn, zucchini, and mozzarella, was disappointingly petite. In fact, it was so small she had to order a second one. Her dessert, the Flourless Chocolate Cake ($10.00), was a letdown for me, but that's a matter of taste.

My Eggplant Parmigiano ($18.00) was deceptively filling and had a great lasagna-like layering of eggplant, ricotta, and mozzarella. Yet, it arrived tepid, which took away from the experience. The side of Roasted Brussels Sprouts ($9.00) with butternut squash and cranberries, however, was delicious and well worth it.

My main gripe? The food temperature. For the price and the proximity, there's no excuse for the meal not to arrive hot. The almost-cold eggplant and hardened cheese were a letdown. The quality of the food is undeniable, but the execution fell short. I'm giving Bistango three stars, with hopes warmer weather might bring a warmer meal.",1

Accidental fish- it comes with only 3 shrimps which were very less. and they charge $22 bucks for this. taste-wise, it was not that great.  well, you're paying for the ambiance, experience too.They have done a marvelous job.

19081,"Title: A National Burger Day Treat at [Restaurant Name]

Review:

From the much-anticipated opening to our first bite, [Restaurant Name] didn't just meet our expectations on National Burger Day—it soared right past them. The All American Burger plate, a complimentary delight for the first 100 visitors, was a mouthwatering experience. I savored my burger cooked to medium-rare perfection, accompanied by a hefty portion of crispy fries and a fresh side of lettuce and tomato, not to mention the tangy half pickle that added just the right zing.

The indulgence didn't stop there; the Churro milkshake was a decadent affair. Even when split three ways, it was more than satisfying, with its warm, crispy churro and the ingenious addition of Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal for an extra bit of crunch.

Kudos to the presentation, which was as top-notch as the flavors, and the customer service was nothing short of spectacular. A shoutout to Matt, our waiter, whose attentiveness and sparkling personality only enhanced our experience.

Seduced by the day's offerings, I'm already planning my next visit for a Churro milkshake encore and to dive into the intriguing flavors of their kimchi shrimp burger. [Restaurant Name] has definitely won over this burger aficionado.",1

Everything about this place feels special (tbh, the price reflects it). Our waitress was super knowledgeable and was very good at up selling the food. Tbh, I thought the popovers were just ok. The scallops were amazing. My friends enjoyed their meal. They got the pot luck special (soup and salad combo) and I got the mandarin orange soufflé w chicken salad. The soufflé was very gelatinous- but paired well with the chicken salad. Would definitely love to come back for tea and try new things!",0

15289,"Title: A Dream Destination for Noodle & Dumpling Lovers

I cannot contain my enthusiasm for this gem of a restaurant—hands down, a haven for noodle and dumpling aficionados! The portions are generous, and the prices? Unbeatable. Their recent interior revamp has elevated the ambiance, making the space incredibly welcoming.

But let's talk about the star of the show—the sweet and sour lamb dumplings. They're an explosive flavor bomb, packing that perfect spicy punch that tingles the taste buds delightfully. A fair heads-up to those shy of spice: tread carefully, as even their 'mild' noodles carry a heat that sneaks up on you.

Overall, an exquisite dining experience that leaves me counting down the days until my next visit. If you crave delectable noods and dumplings that haunt your dreams for all the right reasons, this is your spot.",1
1439,"Title: Happy Hour Heaven with a Hint of Attitude at Pinch

As a connoisseur of happy hours, I can't help but rave about the experience at Pinch. The atmosphere is electric starting at 5pm, building to a buzzing crowd by 6. Their dollar dumplings steal the spotlight; the pork soup dumplings are exceptional with their delicate, thin wrappers and mouthwatering soup—a contender for the best in the city.

Spicy wontons deliver a pleasing warmth without overpowering the palate, while the sweet Sichuan wings will tantalize any spice-lover's taste buds; their crispy skin coupled with a sweet and spicy sauce achieves a comforting balance that makes them a standout dish.

The drink specials, priced between $6 and $9, are a steal. However, not everything is perfect. Despite mostly great service, a recent encounter with a less-than-friendly bartender left a sour taste. Unpleasant interactions and idle gossip about colleagues within earshot of customers are simply unacceptable.

Despite this hiccup, the allure of the food is irresistible. Pinch will see me again, their culinary delights more than making up for any service slip-ups.",1

10543,"Title: A Top-Tier Burger Experience in NYC

I ventured into this bustling spot, lured by the acclaim of their charbroiled burger, and left more than satisfied. It may not have claimed the title of the absolute best burger I've ever eaten, but it proudly holds its ground in my top three. The secret? A superb quality of meat that sets the foundation for a truly delicious burger experience. The cheese topping was a tad overwhelming for my taste, occasionally overshadowing the meat's natural flavors. Accompanying the burger, the fries were commendable and rounded out the meal nicely.

The drink selection deserves a shout-out for potency - a buzz complementing the lively atmosphere with a bar that attracted patrons throughout the night. A word to the wise: reservations are a smart move. We faced a 45-minute wait without one, a testament to the place's popularity. Overall, while the wait was a bit long, the meal itself was a delight.",1
15463,"Title: A Pre-Opera Dinner with a View at The Smith

Last night, before an enchanting evening at La Boheme at the Metropolitan Opera, my friend and I dined at The Smith, conveniently located just across the street. Upon my arrival, my friend, who had been seated in a stuffy and cramped back room, suggested we move. We opted for the outdoor seating, which proved to be a wise choice, allowing us more space and a lovely view; I faced the MET, and she enjoyed the bustling scene of the restaurant.

For dinner, I savored the sea bass oreganato, served over a bed of black rice laced with a delicate sauce and diced carrots. The fish, with its crispy skin, was a delight to the palate. It's a must-try for seafood aficionados – a dish I would certainly revisit. My friend's filet mignon, accompanied by an ample serving of brussels sprouts, was tasty, though not the standout of the meal.

The service was average; our waiter, unfortunately, lacked attentiveness, failing to check in on us post-serving. While not completely wowed by the experience, the well-prepared sea bass alone is a reason to return or to try at another The Smith location in the future.",1
20921,Great fresh and tasty seafood boil! I would highly recommend the Ghost street flavor boil! The taste is very authentic with a mix of Sichuan into the Cajun flavor! The food here was very fresh and the salty egg Dungeness  crab was off the charts! Other than that I loved the popcorn chicken! I would highly recommend it as one of ur choices with the super combo!,0
3635,"We wrapped up our evening at Chelsea Market here. We decided to get one last sandwich and the grilled peanut butter and jelly sounded good. You order at the counter, take a number, and then find a seat. We didn't have to wait too long for our food. When our food arrived, they handed me a tray that was so hot I dropped it immediately before it burned my hands. Given how hot the tray was and the fact that our sandwich was grilled, I figured our sandwich would be warm. I was wrong. It was maybe room temperature. Pretty much just a regular PB&J. It was fine but not what was ordered. I wouldn't come back again. There are much better places at Chelsea Market.",0
14439,"Was it the best ramen? No. Lol, I saw another review and had to copy that person. 3.5 stars probs. Unfotunately, they don't post their menu anywhere online, so I can only tell you the exact name of my bowl of ramen. The Spicy Miso was not bad. It was spicy, but the noodle texture was wrong. It didn't carry the broth. Soup was a little bland towards the end. Overall, was alright. The drinks were alright too. Got a lemony vodka thing, and it was average. Friend got a Green Matcha Drink, and the presentation was cool. Both drinks are pretty strong though.Prices are average for ramen like ~$16. And drinks were like ~$10 each. Would recommend maybe trying once but def not the best option out there.",0
18452,"I actually dropped in yesterday for a quick bite to eat. After a few minutes of being there, I left wondering how I could ever have skipped this place. I've been walking by for so long but have never been inside.Let me start by saying that everything here looks amazing. I was left with so many options that I had trouble making a choice on what to eat next. I actually grabbed the salmon salad and tangerine juice. Now when I came in, I diddnt know how this worked and I ended up grabbing a pre made salad thinking I would be able to sit in the dining area and eat it. To my surprise, this was not how it worked. The dining area is actually a sit down resturant. They were nice enough to let me sit and eat. Then I actually found out that they have French onion soup there. So I ate some I ordered some of that as well. The food all had a unique amazing and extremely fresh taste to it.The servers were amazingly friendly and everything was perfect. I was very pleased with evetything about this place. I will be back often as I live around the corner.",0
15473,"This is probably one of the best peruvian chicken placed Ive ever been to. The food is fresh and extremely good. As soon as we walked in, my group was seated and served. We didnt need much time with the menu because it was only a page and we also yelped the place before we arrived..We ordered the Matador combo, which is their whole chicken, saffron rice and beans, fries and their hotdog slices, avocado salad, and plantains chips(?). They serve the entire thing with two sauces, which really enhance the flavor. The food came out in about 10 minutes or less, the chicken was still juicy and hot, and the rice was super fluffy. There was not one thing that we didnt devour. All of this came to about 45$ + tip. Which is honestly a steal because we had leftovers that could feed us for dinner. The servers were quick and efficient, constantly filling out waters and checking on us, but not overbearing either. The place was packed but we never felt rushed. Highly recommend this place, everything from the food to the service was fantastic.",0
17122,"Title: A Hidden Gem That Shouldn't Stay Hidden

Last Friday evening, a whimsical dining experience unveiled itself as my friends and I stepped into what can only be described as a hidden gem. Greeted by a modest front, we were swiftly transported to a serene oasis, adorned with plush blue couches and delicate flowers, exuding relaxation and romance.

The attentive and paced service harmonized perfectly with the atmosphere. Although tempted by the 6-course tasting feast, we chose à la carte to accommodate dietary needs. To accompany our meal, a wine flight offered generous pours that exceeded value expectations.

The culinary journey began with a delectable fish board, featuring an array of fresh fish paired with a tantalizing sour cream and roe sauce. The crepes were a delightful canvas for the flavorsome fish. Meanwhile, the borscht received nods of approval. The main course introduced us to a tender beef stroganoff and aromatic mushrooms, though the latter's portion size left us wanting.

The grand finale, a table-mixed khachapuri, was the showstopper — an irresistible, cheesy treasure that promises to linger in my memory.

As a first-time explorer of modern European/Russian cuisine, the experience was nothing short of impressive. For those seeking new culinary horizons within an enchanting setting, this restaurant demands your attention. I eagerly anticipate my next visit.",1

16167,"Justino's in NYC is a must-visit for anyone in search of a quick, satisfying pizza fix. This no-frills spot is ideal for a late-night slice or a convenient bite during a bustling city day. They offer an impressive selection, from timeless classics to intriguing twists like buffalo chicken with blue cheese and a standout bacon chicken ranch. Even more adventurous options like vodka pizza and other non-pizza items tempt the taste buds. The slices are generously sized and get a quick oven reheat for that perfect crispness. With substantial portions, most will find a single slice ample. Justino's setup is simple – a small ordering space at the front, with pizza to go.

12334,"Title: Disappointing Caribbean Cuisine with a Saving Grace

Rating: ★☆☆☆☆

My recent visit to this Caribbean spot was underwhelming, to say the least. The redeeming feature of the meal was the quality of the drinks, which were well-crafted and refreshing. Unfortunately, the food did not live up to expectations. The cabbage, along with the rice and peas, was remarkably devoid of flavor, lacking the seasoning one anticipates in Caribbean fare. While my oxtails were tender enough, they too suffered from a severe lack of seasoning, making the dish unremarkable.

My dining companion had an even less enjoyable experience with their oxtails, likening the texture to rubber and noting that the meat seemed merely coated with browning instead of being infused with traditional spices and flavors. Surprisingly, the plantains emerged as the highlight of our brunch. They were the best-executed item on the table.

The ambiance hinted at the experience to come, with the near-empty restaurant lacking the vibrant buzz one associates with a popular brunch spot. I believe that a little culinary attention to the seasoning and sauce could vastly improve the dishes here. If you find yourself considering this restaurant, I suggest stopping in for a drink but seeking your meal elsewhere.",1
12493,Came here with my team for lunch and honestly the food here was great and delicious. They make the food to order so you know it's just cooked and not pre-made or frozen.

I stumbled upon Thai Market during a quest for a swift lunch stop and it didn't disappoint. Arriving at peak time (12 pm), service was expectedly brisk, with a short wait before my order was taken. The lunch special, gra prow kai dow, a delectable mix of chicken, rice, peppers, topped with a perfectly fried egg, hit the spot. Accompanied by a side of heavenly steamed Thai dumplings that boasted a delightful hint of sweetness, my taste buds were in nirvana. Despite a 15-20 minute wait for food, the generous portions more than made up for it. This spot has earned my future patronage, perfect for takeout with its delicious offerings.",1
12959,"Title: A Fresh Take on Fast Casual at Summer Salt

If you ever find yourself in Flatiron looking for a fast casual lunch option that strikes the perfect balance between speed and quality, look no further than Summer Salt. It's quickly become a recurring destination for myself and my coworkers, testament enough to its appeal.

The menu features staples like tacos and bowls, but the bowl is my personal favorite. It's a hearty foundation of rice, beans, cheese, and your choice of meat, customizable with a selection of toppings that include an exceptionally fresh pico de gallo—a rarity for this genre of eatery.

Their protein options have yet to disappoint, with both the chicken and steak hitting high marks. The fish, available grilled or fried, is next on my list. And for the more adventurous, you can even tuck fries into your burrito—a novel twist I'm excited to try.

But perhaps the most surprising offering at Summer Salt is their selection of alcoholic beverages, including Patron shots and slushies—a fun and welcome addition that makes me eager to schedule my next visit for a post-work treat. Summer Salt isn't just doing fast casual right; they're redefining what it can be.",1
12618,"My friends and I stopped by this bar for a drink while waiting for our table at Attaboy, but our experience was just mediocre. The drinks menu failed to impress, serving up rather average concoctions that didn't stand out from any typical bar fare. Additionally, the seating layout left much to be desired, as certain spots were subject to a blast of hot air from an inconveniently placed heating fan, making our stay less comfortable than anticipated.",1
20848,"Title: Dimmed Delights at a Hyped NYC Eatery

I recently visited a much-hyped restaurant in NYC, lured in by the shimmering allure of its lighting. Unfortunately, the sparkle ended there. The Lamb Vindaloo was the sole standout, worthy of praise for its authentic flavors. However, the Tandoori Chicken was a letdown, parched to the point of being inedible. The Tikki Masala could hardly compete with the convenience of a frozen meal from Trader Joe’s. And the Naan Bread? A case of mistaken identity, as we were undoubtedly served pita instead.

Don’t let the luminous promise of this spot fool you – it’s anything but lit in the culinary department. The service was average at best, and while the prices might appeal to a college student’s wallet, the experience certainly doesn’t justify the cost. Cramped but casual, the ambiance might suit a group looking for fun, but for anyone in pursuit of a memorable meal, I’d suggest looking elsewhere.

17855,We absolutely needed a slice of pizza and this place did the trick. A slice of regular and a slice with pepperoni! It totally hit the spot!

14193,"Great place to go for people with different tastes! So much variety and options. Buffet items are charged by the pound,  which made it more expensive for what we got. But, everything was delicious! We went there shortly after landing in NYC and got breakfast,  several different omelets,  breakfast meats, potatoes and fresh fruit. But they had so much more! Quesadilla station, sandwich, salad, and more and more! Small seating area inside, but really designed for busy new Yorkers to grab and go. I would love to come back with my family some time. We stayed near by at the Westin. If we were there longer we would have gone several times , no doubt",0
19244,"Title: A Mixed Bag at a Bustling Saturday Spot

My friend and I chanced upon this eatery at 6 PM on a Saturday, prepared for a busy scene but enticed by the prospect of a good meal. The host promptly informed us of a 30-40 minute wait, but the option to linger at the back bar softened the blow. The bar experience started off rocky, with some self-service tidying and a bit of a wait for the bartender's attention. Once we ordered, both drinks and food didn't hasten to our side, but we were patient patrons that evening.

When the food arrived, the tzatziki, though thicker than typical, had a palatable flavor, complemented by excellent bread. The roasted lemon potatoes, while well-cooked, missed the mark with unbalanced flavors, tipping the scales too far into lemon territory for my taste. The moussaka stood out as the highlight in terms of taste – rich and substantial enough to recommend for sharing, despite not topping my list of favorites.

Ambiance-wise, prepare for an energetic and potentially overwhelming atmosphere; the space felt cramped and the noise level was elevated, thanks to the combination of chatty diners, ambient sounds, and loud music that seemed to be part of the restaurant's character.

In summary, while the restaurant served as a convenient stop to sate our hunger, it didn't dazzle us. It's a place to fill up and experience the buzz of a busy night out, but it might not make it onto the list of top dining experiences.",1
17328,"Title: Timeless Delights at Our Go-To Spot

After another visit to this culinary gem in February 2020, I am happy to report that the quality has remained impeccable, if not improved. The carbonara continues to impress, perfectly prepared with a silky raw egg yolk that enriches the pasta in the traditional manner. The fritto misto was a symphony of crispy, golden-fried seafood, including tender squid and plump shrimp, all tasting incredibly fresh.

A highlight of the meal was the Caesar salad, which was refreshingly authentic. The slight anchovy flavor paired with a sparing use of cheese resulted in a well-balanced, classical rendition of the dish that steers clear of unnecessary modern twists.

While my visit was a brief lunch in the midst of a busy day, the experience left me eager to return for a more leisurely dinner. I must commend the staff for their consistent excellence, from the welcoming front desk to the attentive service throughout the meal. This restaurant remains a must-visit for anyone who appreciates time-honored cuisine executed to perfection.",1

Review:
My colleagues and I at the local rehabilitation facility were recently treated to an unexpected delight courtesy of Sauce Pizzeria. Amidst the grueling pandemic, Sauce generously donated 15 of their fabulous pizzas to our hardworking team. More than just a meal, it was a gesture of kindness that truly lifted our spirits. Each bite was a reminder of the community support we've received during these tough times. The pizzas were nothing short of fantastic, brimming with flavor and perfectly cooked. A huge thank you to Sauce for their thoughtfulness and incredible food that helped us through. Highly recommended for anyone craving a slice of heartfelt care baked into every pizza.",1

Opting for the large duck meal at just $6, the value was undeniable, offering a serving so generous I split it between lunch and a late-night snack. Accompanied by cooked cabbage and rice drenched in savory meat juices, it was the definition of a hearty meal. While the street brimmed with similar eateries, this quaint establishment's charm and quality stood out. I'd be inclined to try its neighbors too, in a show of support for small businesses, should I find myself back in the area. Remember to bring cash when you visit – it's the only currency they trade in for their culinary delights.",1
13102,"Tucked away at the corner of 104th Street and Broadway, this gem of a restaurant offers a delightful takeout experience. My recent visit involved a seamless order of Chicken Rendang with coconut rice, a hearty dish priced at a reasonable $13.60. Despite it being a calm Sunday afternoon around 4 PM with only a few tables occupied, service was quick, taking a mere 20 minutes from order to pick-up.

Payment is a breeze as they accept credit cards. The staff's proficiency in Cantonese/Chinese adds an authentic touch to the experience. The food itself was outstanding: the Rendang - a flavorful Malaysian style curry with tender chicken, green beans, and potato - packed just the right amount of heat. If you're sensitive to spice, proceed with caution.

The coconut rice was a standout, its fragrant aroma complementing the robust curry perfectly. With other options like white and brown rice available, rice lovers are well catered to. Based on a recommendation, their noodles are also a must-try.

Eager to explore their extensive menu further, I'm already planning my next visit. This spot is a must for anyone in search of an authentic, delicious meal.",1
1048,Let me start by saying that I love this place from jump. Nakamura is a ramen spot that must be enjoyed by all ramen lovers in New York and beyond. The spot is small but many of the restaurants in the area are small. The size of the restaurant is perfect for date night or perhaps a group of four. I enjoyed my delicious bowl of  ramen solo and that's ok too. The decor of the restaurant is pretty basic but bright and inviting. The staff is very friendly and from the very beginning they made sure to inform me of their specials and additions.  I'm one of those people who like spice and they delivered. My bowl of ramen had me sweating bullets by the end. I truly enjoyed my meal and I'm so looking forward to return in the next few days. Do yourself a favor and head over to Nakamura for what I promise will be a guaranteed treat.,0

15326,"Title: A Delightful Surprise at the Chicken and Waffle Haven

From the moment I stepped into this quaint eatery, my dining experience soared beyond my initial expectations. The star of the show was undoubtedly the chicken and waffles, a dish that married crispy, well-seasoned poultry with perfectly cooked waffles. The inventive selection of flavored butters, especially the strawberry and lemon, brought each bite to life, though the rosemary variety was not to my liking.

The true revelation, however, was the Mac and cheese. Despite feeling full, I found myself drawn to its rich, creamy texture and the satisfying crunch of bread crumbs over tender shell pasta—a dish I'd gladly indulge in again.

While the drinks left something to be desired—I found the Bellini rather ordinary and am curious about the mimosa for next time—the service was efficient with quick seating, although not particularly memorable.

The ambiance of the space, with its cozy window seats ideal for two, added to the charm of the restaurant. Although slightly tight in the back, it wasn't an issue for someone of a smaller stature like myself.

In summary, my palate was pleasantly surprised, and I am eager to return and explore more of what the menu has to offer.",1
17792,"Title: A Mixed Bag at Shinagawa – Room for Improvement

My recent visit to Shinagawa in Murray Hill left me with mixed feelings, prompting me to give it a 3-star rating. While lured in by numerous glowing Yelp reviews, my dining experience didn’t quite hit that 4.5-star expectation.

I went for the Sushi Shinagawa dinner entree, a generous spread for $35. The miso soup was a highlight but the appetizer sampler didn't hit the mark, finding each dish a tad over-seasoned or overly sweet. The sushi assortment featured generally fresh cuts, yet the Maine uni left an unpleasant aftertaste that was hard to ignore.

My friend's experience was similarly patchy; the hamachi yuzu was overwhelmed by salt, but the ikura nigiri and salmon avocado roll were enjoyable. Unfortunately, several desired items were unavailable, which was disappointing.

On the upside, the service was amiable and the environment surpassed expectations in cleanliness and ambiance.

While not fully convinced by Shinagawa, the value proposition of their happy hour – with attractive discounts on drinks and oysters – might just warrant another visit. Here's hoping for a more consistent round two.",1

16556,"This ramen spot is located right around 34th street by the empire state building. My partner and I decided to go there after visiting the Empire State Building. The decor is stylish and nice. On the fancier scale to make it look modern. When we arrived the place had almost every table sat. Luckily, we did not have to wait.      We had the Koku medium spicy ramen and the kimchi tan tan ramen. I had the Koku Ramen which was very nice and savory. The broth was truly the highlight of this ramen. The noodles were thinner than I am accustomed to, but still tasted amazing. The pork belly had a nice portions of meat vs. fat allowing the broth to really be absorbed into it. The pork belly was on the sweeter side so the broth allowed a very nice bittersweet blend. Great dish! Might go spicier next time.     My partner had the Kimchi Tan Tan Ramen which was a taste you'd have to acquire. It was the first time either of us had kimchi so it was quite the experience. Could probably say we are not kimchi people but it did not take away from the savory flavors of this ramen. The noodles were thicker and the broth was spicier then the Koku. Something that caught us completely off guard was the peanut butter in the broth. Yes, peanut butter. It wasn't something we expected in a good way but still it was an experience. Perfect for any peanut butter lover that wants a fun adventure on the palate.     Last but not least, the service was superb. We never ran out of water and all of our needs were met in a very timely manner. One of the best services we have received in a while. Overall five star establishment! Great experience.",0
16649,"This restaurant is pretty new and close to Columbia University. The night my friend and I visited is probably one of the coldest day of the year. One suggestion to the restaurant is that maybe they should put a wind shield plastic door outside of their door so that when other customers enter, the tables around the door area won't be so cold. ColdThe food is truly amazing! Since there is nothing else around Columbia, this place stands out for sure! I have ordered the fisherman combo, which comes with 1lb of shrimp and 1lb of snow crab. The bag also come with potato and corns. I added half pound of mussel in it. I did not see any sausage or jelly noodle (mo yu) to add in, maybe could be some other choices to add to the menu. I have choose the mighty sauce medium, and warning. It is spicy! I ended have to ask the owner whether they can recook the boil a bit with the garlic sauce, since it's way too spicy for me. They have extremely good service, and willing to help us recook everything. So maybe a mild or a garlic flavor will be preferred if you can't eat that spicy. The portion of the food is huge! I had so much shrimp and crab! They are quite fresh and firm, definitely some good quality seafood. The corn is really sweet and the potato is well cooked! We have also order fried oyster and sweet potato fries. The fried oyster comes with French fries, and the oyster is good since the flour coating isn't too thick. My friend had lobster tail, which I got to try a little, it's really tender! Overall the food is delicious! During the time we were there, there are some people order take out, but due to the cold weather, the restaurant was pretty empty. There is only one lady was there with us the whole time. Definitely can do a walk in. I would suggest you give a try if you are around the area, worth the price!",0
16913,"Title: A Pleasant Surprise at Casa Nonna

I recently dined at Casa Nonna with a party of six and was met with a seamless experience. Snagging a last-minute reservation proved to be no hassle, and their accommodating nature shined when some of our group arrived fashionably late.

The service was notably amiable, setting a warm atmosphere from the get-go. While waiting, I sampled their dessert wine—their sole offering—which was a delightful precursor to the meal.

Culinary speaking, my spaghetti was impressive in texture, albeit not extraordinary in flavor. The dish was slightly overwhelmed by its abundant, salty sauce. Meanwhile, the chicken parm our table tried was generous in size but received lukewarm reviews in taste. It seems exploring their menu further could yield better results.

In conclusion, while Casa Nonna may not top my list of Manhattan Italian eateries, its service and ambience make it worthy of a visit for those nearby.",1

We shared four biscuits among us, and they were a highlight - buttery, flaky, and downright amazing. The fries didn't disappoint either; their shoestring crunchiness was on point. I'm already looking forward to our next visit to explore more of their breakfast offerings. Definitely a place to come back to!",1

Despite the high demand, which often translates into daunting lines, service remains remarkably prompt. The quick turnaround from order to table means you’re diving into your meal before the anticipation can turn to impatience.

Yin Jin Chang Fen stands out as a very solid choice for anyone in Chinatown looking to indulge in some tasty and authentic cuisine. Just be prepared for a wait—it's well worth it!",1
12776,The refinery rooftop is located inside the refinery HotelWe were waiting for a table at the Parker and Quinn restaurant which is covered under a separate reviewThe host recommended that we wait upstairs and it was absolutely brilliant suggestionGiven it was a Sunday morning we enjoyed a deconstructed Mamosa that included a full bottle of Prosecco with a generous side bottle of a peach purée that allowed you to dose your drinks to each individual likingThe bartender was a pro and put on a nice presentation with all of the drinks that he served. We were perched at the bar and had a front row viewing of his performance while we waitedI will be back to the refinery rooftop in the future and actually plan to go prior to a brunch it was that good!,0
2377,"Not a big mussels person but I liked Flex a lot. I love all seafood but mussels just aren't at the top of my list of shellfish. But if you're a diehard bivalve fan, you would love Flex - so many varieties of a massive tub, along with crusty bread to dip into the leftover broth. I tried a few from the Maine one with lobster and the combination was delicious. Everything was a touch on the pricey side. Having enjoyed my way through so many $1 oyster HH deals in the city, I can't condone paying almost $4 per oyster, even though the two I grudgingly ordered were nice and juicy and ... somewhere on the West Coast? And how much do mussels go at the supermarket's seafood counter?  Lobster roll came with gratifying chunks of lobster but, I mean, once you've had a roll from a tiny roadside shack in Maine, nothing else quite compares. This one had diced celery and a bit of mayo but the bun could have used some more oil and crispiness. Fries were delicious. The star of the show is the donut flight. Do NOT forget the donuts. They come out piping hot with a layer of sugar crystals and I could have seriously eaten two or three more. Donuts beat mussels. Worth coming here just for these.",0
18385,"I recently dined at this charming eatery that's ideal for a midday meal or some laid-back after-work libations. The standout for me was the Berza Salad – a delightful vegan option featuring tender Tuscan kale, zesty grapefruit, creamy avocado, crunchy pine nuts, sweet golden raisins, and fragrant dill, all rounded out with the hearty addition of chickpeas. This entrée-sized salad impressed me with its harmonious flavor balance and the kale's pleasingly soft texture, a far cry from the typically coarse greens one might expect. The dressing was a winner too: light yet packed full of taste.

Additionally, the Pan con Tomate provided a simple yet satisfying accompaniment, adding to the meal's enjoyment. The atmosphere of the place added to the experience – it's lively and inviting, making it a fine choice for a casual meal or a relaxing drink after work.",1
19375,"TLDR: Khao Soi.I don't really quite remember how we ended up here but somehow we did. The interior kind of reminds me of Bunker (the original location) but on to the food. They offer both Filipino and Thai dishes here so it's kind of a mixed menu.Personally, I really like the Khao Soi here. The noodles are nicely separated, it's easy to eat, the chicken is shredded (not traditional - I know) and it just has so much flavor. The toppings come assembled already unlike most Khao Soi(s) I've had but I really liked this. When we think of Khao Soi, our minds divert to Pig & Khao.The Chili Pan Mee is solid too. It's more of a dryer noodle. Ramen, crispy anchovies, spicy pork - more of a spicy theme. The Sisig is decent but as others have noted, not the best I've had. I noticed it's a bit on the drier side.We haven't really tried their other dishes and we may some day. We just really dig the Khao Soi here in case you haven't guessed.It is on the pricier side. We're talking $16+ for a bowl of noodles.",0
13597,"Im not a pizza connoisseur, i'm from California where good pizza is Pizza Hut and Domino's. So my review may or may not be valid haha. But since it's my first and only NY pizza experience, it's my favorite.My family and I shared the infamous Artichoke slice, Crab, Vodka, and Meat Lover's.In all honesty, the artichoke pizza was not my favorite. To me it was just a big heavy bite of cream sauce so I wasn't really impressed.My favorite is hands down the Crab Pizza. They pack in the crab and it's not overly saucy in comparison to the artichoke and vodka pizza. My mom (who actually hates pizza) also raves about the Crab Slice.Can't go wrong with the Meat Lover's slice. The bottom crust is so crispy, which ive never had but i totally dig it.Totally worth the hype.",0
10500,"Title: Valentine's Day Dinner Experience

My partner and I visited this restaurant for their Valentine's Day special menu. The food quality was satisfactory, with the tuna tartar standing out as particularly excellent—both fresh and flavorful, it left us impressed and without any concerns for food safety. Their squid ink pasta also added a unique touch to the meal. Despite the busy holiday evening, service was prompt, and the staff managed to be both kind and attentive.

However, the dining experience was dampened by the overly loud atmosphere. With tables crammed together and booming live music, intimate conversation was challenging unless seated at the most remote part of the restaurant. While the energy was high, those looking for a quieter, more personal evening might find it less suitable.

In summary, the restaurant delivered on good food and service, but the noise level could be a deterrent for those seeking a more subdued dining environment.",1
12507,"Title: Timeless Flavors at a Historic Spot

After a delightful movie experience at Angelika theater, my companion and I were drawn to a venerable eatery, a stone's throw away, steeped in history since 1847. The ambiance of the past whispered as we stepped inside, securing a table without delay.

Our server, with the poise of a model, expertly guided us through the menu, leading to an unexpected unanimous decision: the veggie burger. Skepticism gave way to intrigue, and soon after, to satisfaction as the savory burger, adorned with a flavorful pesto, graced our palates. Accompanied by a fresh side salad, even the typically unappealing burger bread won my begrudging approval.

The dish was devoured with gusto, and while the burger couldn't sing its own praises, I am more than willing to extol its virtues. Despite the bustling atmosphere, the service was attentive and prompt, ensuring we felt seen and cared for.

Would I return? Absolutely, perhaps as a delicious encore to my next Angelika theater outing.",1
10819,"I'm disappointed because the photos look better than what the food actually was. If you don't like cumin, this is definitely not the place for you because most dishes are flavored with heavy cumin and the smell is strong. Worst of all - I ordered the stir fry noodle but it came out as regular noodles with tomato sauce (wasn't what I expected).I will say the third star is for their friendly staffs - I called last minute and asked if they can save a seat for a group of 8 and they were super accommodating and saved the seat for me immediately as I rushed over. So thank you so much for that hospitality! But I don't think I loved the food that much, sorry :/",0
18345,"I had the pleasure of sampling Oath Pizza for the first time during a Yelp event yesterday, and I've become a complete fan. Their signature avocado oil crust is exceptional, possibly the best I've ever tasted - sheer perfection in every bite. I tried a variety of their offerings, including the Muffled Trushroom, Classic Cheese, and Bella, and each was delightful in its own right. For those who love customization, Oath Pizza also offers a 'make your own pizza' option with a tempting selection of fresh toppings and sauces. I heartily recommend giving this place a try. Even if you're not typically a pizza enthusiast, Oath Pizza might just convert you.",1
2116,"Title: A Satisfying Noon Feast at a Local Gem

I recently dined at this establishment on a calm Saturday noon, right as their doors swung open. The service was notably quick and admirably attentive, which made the meal even more enjoyable. The restaurant was quieter than expected, but that may just be due to the weekend timing.

The food impressed with its quality; the dry pot bursting with bold flavors and a spice level that's spot-on for the average diner. However, spice enthusiasts like myself should consider upping the ante for that authentic fiery kick. A word to the cilantro-averse: the dry pot comes generously garnished with it, so make your preferences clear to avoid any green surprises.

The braised pork was the star of the show—succulent, rich, and served in a generous helping that promised contentment in every bite. The peppered chicken, while leaning towards the Americanized palate, was still a delectable choice. Each dish left us satisfied and eager for a return visit.",1
14984,"From the moment we stepped into the restaurant, we were smitten with its offerings. Each dish we sampled was a delightful experience, tempting us to return for a complete exploration of their menu. The staff deserves applause for their impeccable service, enhancing our already exceptional visit.

Sharing is the way to go here, as you'll inevitably find yourself yearning for a taste from your companion's plate—with every dish seemingly as appetizing as the next. And let me offer one piece of advice: the gnocchi is divine, no matter the variation. In truth, it appears you can't go wrong with any choice at this establishment. I eagerly anticipate my next visit to continue the culinary journey.",1
15262,"Title: A Fried Chicken Joint with a Sweet Twist

If your craving leads you toward crispy, succulent fried chicken, look no further. This local gem, known for its poultry prowess, has once again captured my foodie heart – not with its famed main course this time, but with its delightful pie cups, especially on Pi Day when these little treasures are a steal at $3.14 each.

In the spirit of the occasion, I was faced with an enviable dilemma: choosing from the array of flavors like Apple Strudel, Double Cherry, Whiskey Buttermilk, Bourbon Pecans, and the intriguing Pie of the Month, Cowboy. Unable to settle on just one, I indulged in both the Apple Strudel, which was nothing short of perfection, and the Cowboy – a harmonious blend of sweet and savory that caters to the indecisive.

While an employee's recommendation of the Sweet Potato Pie Cup tugged at my curiosity, I decided to save that experience for another day. And let's not gloss over the Strawberry Milkshake – a creamy, dreamy concoction that alone justifies the trip.

In summary, whether you are here for the chicken or a sweet treat, you're in for a delight. Next time you're in the mood for something that satisfies both your savory cravings and sweet tooth, give this place a try. You won't regret it.",1
18520,"I love a good happy hour and this place definitely did not disappoint! I came here on a Thursday with a few friends and it was reasonably busy. The set up of this place is that you order at the counter and they bring your food to your table. I found that to be a good and bad thing. Good because you don't have to be constantly hounded by a waiter or waiting forever for the waiter to come back to your table before you can place your order. Bad because if you come at a busy time, you could easily not find a table. When we first arrived, there were no seats available so we had to wait a while before we finally found a table for our group of four. Being proactive is a necessary trait for finding a seat during happy hour at this place (*think the parking lot search at a mall on Black Friday*). The tables are also kinda tiny, but this is NYC so that's expected lol.After finding a seat, we ordered our food from the counter. The Happy Hour prices are somewhat more reasonable than the regular menu (although I was confused about the pricing for the mini tacos...$17 for 10 mini tacos????). For me the main attraction was the $6 frozen margaritas. I was definitely pleased to find a place in the city that offers that. I also ordered the loaded chicken nachos. It wasn't like typical nachos and I do think they could have added more chicken to it as I felt i was eating mostly chips and peppers. The service there is also great! Even though there is no designated waiter, I still felt attended to. I ordered 2 margaritas, but only received 1 because they forgot to add the second one to my tab. Once they realized the error, they offered me the second one on the house, which I thought was incredibly sweet. Overall I'd give it a plus for the atmosphere, the staff, and the margaritas (the margaritas alone deserve 5 stars). But I'd knock off a star because of the seating situation and I wasn't 100% satisfied with the food.",0
17058,"A wonderful experience all around. Came here for my birthday it's a beautiful restaurant. The owner was very kind, and the waitress was attentive, funny, and warm. Everything we ordered was great! Some things that stood out include the crab appetizer. I never eat crab because I find that it can be fishy, but this was smooth and had a Smokey flavor almost. The scallops were also wonderful, and huge! For my main I got one of the shrimp dishes, which was served in a coconut with coconut sauce and mustard seeds. It was incredible, my brother agreed it was the best dish. Highly recommend this place if you want a nice dinner with different food.",0
10042,"I recently tried ordering from DimSum28, an extension of Chef28, through Seamless. Despite offering convenient features like Order Ahead, my experience was undermined by poor service. I had scheduled delivery for 7:30 pm on a Thursday, but after a delay and no communication from the restaurant, I reached out only to encounter rudeness. The staff member who answered was unhelpful and abruptly hung up—making it a very unpleasant interaction.

As for the food, it was fairly average. The Beef Chow Fun had a generous portion of both noodles and beef, and the Shrimp Dumplings (ha gow) were satisfactory, meriting a 3-star rating purely based on taste and portion size. Unfortunately, the negative customer service experience overshadowed the meal, deterring me from returning.",1
19088,"Title: A Meat Lover's Delight at Wah Fung No 1

Wah Fung No 1 is a gem in Chinatown that absolutely lives up to its reputation. My recent visit saw me indulging in their renowned Roasted Duck and Pork. The meat was succulent, striking a perfect balance between salty and sweet. Served atop rice that had soaked up all the meaty goodness, this dish was devoured within moments—testament to its deliciousness.

This spot is no-frills, essentially a tiny nook where culinary magic happens. The efficiency of the staff ensures each order is freshly made and piping hot, despite the frantic pace and cramped space that hardly fits a small crowd.

Due to the lack of seating, we took our flavorful feast to a nearby bench, which did not detract from the experience. For anyone in or visiting the Chinatown area, Wah Fung No 1 is a must. It's an unmissable experience for those seeking authentic and mouthwatering Chinese roasted meats.",1
13207,"The food was bland to me.  All these awesome reviews did not measure up to the experience.  Portions are teeny, and the service was average.  The price however was very high in my opinion.  $20 for eggs benedict that does not fill you up and $17 for a plate of eggs with avocado again that doesn't fill you up - wasn't great to me.  I like the location, west village and the concept of unique combinations like apple and eggs and wild mushrooms.  The other thing is only wine and beer served.  On a hang over day, this is not your place.",0
20295,"Title: A Whimsical Dim Sum Delight with Room for Improvement

My friends and I ventured into a dim sum feast this weekend, excited by the creative offerings on the menu. The Hello Kitty buns, filled with creamy custard, burst with sweetness upon first bite, though I craved a softer touch to the bun's texture. Conversely, the Piggy buns' airy softness perfectly complemented the rich red bean filling.

The Five Senses XLB intrigued us with its variety: onion, veggie, truffle oil, spicy, and sweet onion. Unfortunately, the skins proved a tad too thick for my liking, but the truffle oil XLB stood out with its luxurious flavor. The Matcha roast pork buns married a traditional pineapple bun's texture with the novel twist of matcha - a delectable combination.

However, not all dishes hit the mark. The pan-fried pork dumplings raised concerns with its somewhat pink center, suggesting undercooking. The pork spare ribs, braised chicken feet, and pan-fried turnip cake, while not offensive, were simply unremarkable.

A sweet surprise - leveraging the Yelp app snagged us an additional helping of the Hello Kitty buns, a charming bonus to our culinary adventure.

Overall, the restaurant offered a fusion of playful and classic dim sum, though some traditional elements fell short. 3/5 stars.",1
14148,"After a recent visit, I feel that awarding Brazil Brazil a solid three-star rating is just about right. While the establishment didn't quite hit the mark in terms of ambiance to push it into the four-star territory, the dining experience still had its merits.

As a newcomer to Brazilian cuisine, I was pleasantly surprised by the mussels with marinara sauce; they were simply excellent. My companions, both well-acquainted with their native country's fare, opted for the traditional Brazilian steak and a mixed seafood dish boasting clams, shrimp, and mussels. Though I only feasted with my eyes on the latter, it certainly looked appetizing, and the steak received high praise from my friends.

Service-wise, while amiable and efficient, the pacing was a bit sluggish, with our food taking longer than expected to arrive. Nonetheless, the quality of the dishes was worth the wait, ensuring that the evening was, on the whole, a positive experience.",1
13875,"I came here on a Saturday night as a party of two - the place was pretty empty so we were seated immediately. We had a 30% Crave deal so we figured why not try this place out. The thing that stands out the most here is the service. The kind and attentive staff really made this place memorable. Some of the bests service I've experienced on a dining adventure in the city, honestly. There's basically AYCE veggies and an assortment of items such as fish balls and fish cakes. I think their selection of veggies was super great. I definitely ate more veggies than I normally did. Even tried a few vegetables that I've never had before! There is also a sauce station - it was a lot of fun putting together different sauces, scallions, cilantros, etc. and trying my hot pot food items with my concoctions.You pay separately for the meat trays - we got quite a few, including beef and lamb. If you're getting meat, this can definitely add up on the bill. The place was clean with simple designs.I would give a 3/5 for food quality. However, the service was 5/5 and bumps this review up.",0

From the moment I walked in, amazing aromas filled the air, promising a delightful sensory experience. And it didn't stop there—the food was as good as it smelled! Each dish was a feast for the eyes and the taste buds alike. To top it off, the service was impeccable, with attentive and friendly staff making the entire meal even more enjoyable. If you're in the city and looking for an outstanding culinary adventure, this place is a must-visit!",1
19735,"Tucked away in the Upper East Side, this charming and homey dining spot serves up a delightful mix of Mexican cuisine, mouth-watering burgers, and well-priced drinks. Opting for the Bacon Burger, a savory choice served with fries, I found the value unbeatable—the burger was genuinely satisfying. Service was warm and attentive, a refreshing touch on a Saturday afternoon when one might expect a crowded scene. Their red sangria, a steal at $6, was the perfect accompaniment, blending refreshment with a kick. My visit left me eager to return and explore their wider Mexican offerings. This establishment is a solid choice for anyone seeking a casual and quick bite.",1
13697,"I absolutely adore this place for what I consider the best unlimited mimosa brunch around! The real deal – they serve you an entire bottle of champagne with juice on the side, ensuring your glass never stays empty for long. And just like that, when one bottle is gone, another appears. All within a blissful 90-minute all-you-can-drink window. On top of that, the waitstaff are exceptionally cool.

The offerings from the kitchen are no slouch either. I've indulged in both the steak and eggs and the Bedford burger (keto-style, no bun), and they didn't disappoint. The only hiccup in an otherwise stellar experience was the last-minute swap of a vibrant mesculin blend for a lackluster iceberg salad – a decision I hope they'll reconsider.

One more note – a slightly off-putting observation of a female kitchen staffer snacking as I peeked into the kitchen. It might be nothing, but it led me to question whether her hunger was impacting portion sizes.

Even with that, the allure of the endless bubbles will beckon me back. Cheers to many more boozy brunches!",1
19201,"Title: A Highland Haven Defying Gastropub Expectations

Upon entering Highlands, one might expect the usual gastropub fare, but this establishment promptly dispels such notions with its charming decor and ambiance reminiscent of a cozy winter retreat. It was easy to lose oneself in the warmth of the setting, almost reaching for a scotch from their extensive selection before remembering the summer season outside – a testament to the restaurant's distinctive atmosphere.

The trout mousse, a delightful appetizer, set the stage with its palate-cleansing flavors. However, the mushroom toast fell flat, lacking seasoning and excitement. But let's talk about the star of the show: the beef Wellington. This dish alone could redefine the venue's classification. The marriage of succulent, tender steak with the right amount of ham and perfectly baked pastry, all brought together with a rich red sauce, earns a well-deserved standing ovation. It stands shoulder to shoulder with those I've savored at a Gordon Ramsay establishment, proving Highlands is not merely playing in the same field; it's scoring goals.

Service was straightforward, efficient, and refreshingly free of fuss – aligning nicely with the no-nonsense Scottish/Irish vibes and enhancing the overall experience. I wholeheartedly endorse Highlands for those in search of a top-tier beef Wellington. This is no mere gastropub; it's a culinary destination worthy of acclaim.",1
15507,"Title: A Gem for Korean Cuisine Lovers

My affinity for Korean cuisine continues to blossom, and this charming eatery only fuels that passion. The amiable staff immediately set a welcoming tone, extending their warmth with a complimentary second helping of sides – a small, but appreciated gesture.

Opting for the lunch special proved to be a wise decision; it's a hearty combination of a tofu dish, a chicken entrée, and rice, all of which harmonized for a satisfying midday feast. We couldn't resist the egg dish, which, while an excess on our part, was a delightful addition that added to our satiety.

The beef tofu soup was particularly noteworthy – a comforting embrace in a bowl. Initially, one might balk at the price, but considering the quantity and quality of the food served, it becomes evident that this is exceptional value.

I left with no critiques, only a content stomach and the resolve to return. For a fulfilling and hospitable dining experience, this is the spot I'd recommend without hesitation.",1
10055,"I recently visited this pizza joint and was thoroughly impressed with the flavor and affordability of their pies. Despite the value, be prepared for a bit of a wait, as the place is popular and often has long lines. Service is efficient, though, so you'll be sinking your teeth into that delectable pizza in no time. Seating can be a challenge during peak hours, so consider off-times if you want to dine in. A major plus is their late hours, perfect for night owls. The consistency across different locations is commendable, ensuring a reliably tasty experience wherever you are. Highly recommended for those seeking great pizza on a budget.",1
13014,"Title: Hit-and-Miss at the Cafe - A Mixed Bag

My recent visit to this local cafe left me with mixed feelings. The savory offerings were disappointing – the focaccia was generous in size but unfortunately dry and excessively salty. Similarly, my friend's baguette sandwich suffered from bread that was too hard, which might be attributed to our late afternoon visit at 3pm.

Drinks were passable; I ordered a macchiato and hot chocolate. There was a small hiccup with the barista initially preparing the wrong beverage, an issue seemingly echoed by another reviewer. Service might be slipping due to the staff's casual chatter, particularly the hostess who was quite talkative and perhaps distracted from her duties.

I did appreciate that the cafe maintained a pleasant ambience and cleanliness – the place was tidy, including the restroom, and there was a consistent but manageable flow of patrons ensuring seating availability.

In conclusion, if you're considering this spot for a light bite and a drink, it might be a gamble on the food front. Stick to the sweet treats and enjoy the relaxed atmosphere, but be mindful of potential service slip-ups.",1

Now it was step uncooked meats but followed by the side dishes and japchae and bim bim pap and kimichi soup, only delayed food was kimchi fries which was worth the wait cuz it was awesome too .

It was all very fresh and I'm glad I tried it!",0
13882,"Title: Cozy Brunch Spot with a Side of Bubbly Cheer

I recently visited a quaint little brunch locale that's big on flavor, if not in size. The star of my meal was a delightful dish featuring two perfectly poached eggs over seared ham atop a buttery croissant—a choice that certainly lived up to expectations.

Adding to the experience, I indulged in their mojito champagne mimosas. Here's a tip: they're served by the pitcher for a limited time of ninety minutes, so it's best to savor them while you can—and with gusto!

Be warned, the restaurant's cozy dimensions mean it can get quite packed, especially on a Saturday. And there's a strict policy that your entire party must be present to be seated, so punctuality is key.

Despite the snug squeeze, the visit was a pleasure. I'm looking forward to returning to this little gem for another round of brunch goodness.",1
11684,"Title: A Soondubu Sanctuary Near Penn Station

I am a repeat patron at this gem of a Korean restaurant, primarily chasing the exceptional soondubu (spicy tofu stew). Each visit is a gratifying experience that hits the mark with remarkable consistency. For roughly $20, the meal is an extravagant affair of flavors: a variety of banchan (Korean side dishes) that never fail to impress, a side of fried fish, and the star—a bubbling pot of the most exquisite tofu you could imagine. Accompanied by a side of rice and concluded with a refreshing tea soup—a unique concoction of white rice and barley tea—it's a culinary journey that expertly cleanses and satisfies the palate.

The service is efficient, ensuring that each hot dish arrives promptly. The restaurant boasts a spacious interior with ample seating, meaning no long waits for a table, even better considering its convenient location just a short stroll from Penn Station. Add to that the unbelievable perk of its 24-hour operation and affordability, and it's no wonder this spot stands out as a must-visit for Korean food aficionados and night owls alike. Seeking a comforting meal any time of the day? Look no further.",1
2598,"Title: A Delightful Surprise at a Chic New Ramen Spot

Stepping uncertainly into this new eatery, my anticipation was met with an ambiance that swept me off my feet–a beautifully adorned interior that set the stage for an exceptional dining experience. Service here isn't just good; it's outstanding, marked by the warmth of our waiter whose name I regretfully can't recall, but whose recommendations were invaluable.

The menu boasts a delightful variety, but it was the ramen that beckoned me in. Before our main course, the grilled shishito peppers, dusted with a tantalizing salt, became an instant addiction. As for the main event, I chose a spicy pork broth ramen, though the name now escapes me. Suffice it to say, it was a bowl brimming with rich, bold flavors, the spiciness of which I gladly escalated.

A word to the wise: remember to stir your ramen well to avoid a disproportionate mix of salt. My dining companions and I learned this the hard way, resulting in an unevenly seasoned experience for some.

All in all, this place has earned a special spot in my culinary heart, and I find myself longing to return. Highly recommended for anyone seeking a memorable ramen rendezvous.",1
2035,"I recently visited this establishment with a large group and was thoroughly impressed by the exceptional service we received. The staff exhibited remarkable patience and attentiveness throughout our visit. The food offerings were packed with flavor, leaving a lasting impression on my palate. Additionally, the cocktails served were not only potent but also delicious, striking the perfect balance for a refreshing evening drink.

This restaurant comes highly recommended for a girls' night out; its vibrant atmosphere is equally suited for that as it is for a romantic date night, a fact made evident by the numerous couples we noticed enjoying their evening (at least six dates on a Tuesday!). Two standout dishes that you absolutely must try are the queso fundido and the ceviche—both were unforgettable and left us craving more.",1
18309,"This whole COVID situation has enabled me to try out so many restaurants I wouldn't have thought of. I was on Instagram, and I saw one of my friends had posted a really aesthetic sushi box. I looked it up and turns out it was SUGARFISH. I knew of this restaurant but I always thought it would be as expensive as its parent company sushi noz. I took the leap today because I was really craving sushi, and my boyfriend never tried. We ordered from their website and chose ""To-Go Lite Trust Me"" and ""To-Go Nozawa Trust Me"". They were a perfect mix and portion to fill both of us. My all time favorite piece was the tuna sashimi, and my boyfriend had high praise for the scallop pieces. I really enjoyed creating my sauces and following the instructions printed on the box. Overall, I would consider the sushi to be high quality and I don't mind that I paid $82 for two boxes of sushi. I hope that when COVID is over, I can dine inside the restaurant and try some other dishes. 5/5!",0

My recent visit to The Marshal for Saturday brunch was disappointing. Service was painfully slow from the moment we tried to order to the time our subpar meals arrived. My husband's Esposito Frittata was flavorless, while my friend's frittata was merely average. My own Wood Oven Biscuit Sandwich, modified without the pork patty, was underwhelming in size and taste, not justifying its price. The server neglected to check on us, further dampening the experience. Despite its proximity to my home, I won't be returning to The Marshal.

10195,"Title: A Warm Welcome and Comforting Ramen at an Authentic Spot

I recently visited a cozy Japanese ramen shop on a searing Friday evening at 6 PM, following a friend's glowing recommendation. The heartfelt welcome we received upon entering set a genial tone, as all staff members greeted us in Japanese, with an authenticity that made it feel sincere. 

Bucking traditional wisdom, I opted for hot ramen despite the 85℉ weather, possibly exacerbated by a lack of air conditioning; however, the establishment had fans running to provide some relief.

The menu, while simple, offered a selection of chicken paitan broths: shio, shoyu, miso, tan tan, and curry, with a seasonal option of cold ramen. I chose shio to avoid the onions present in shoyu, while my companion went for the miso, curious about a flavor different from her previous shoyu experience.

The miso ramen was a delightful surprise; rich and bursting with chicken flavor sans any greasiness. The grated onion garnish, initially a concern, turned out to be pleasantly mild. The shio, my choice, was lighter yet deeply comforting, its delicate broth hinting at white pepper and complemented by sliced seaweed and radish sprouts, offering a satisfying contrast.

The noodles themselves were the thick, curly type, maintaining their texture throughout the meal, although personally, I'd have preferred a chewier bite. The cha-shu was the only letdown, slightly salty and tough, as if it had been reheated.

Some fellow diners have commented on the ramen's subtleness, noting a potential monotony in flavors, but I found the gentle taste profile soothing. The portion size felt just right initially, but by midnight, a hint of hunger crept back in. Another commendable feature was the attentive service; our water glasses were frequently refilled without prompting, even post-payment, accentuating the absence of any rush to usher us out.

Upon departure, the enthusiastic thank you's from the staff echoed the warmth of our arrival. Despite a slightly awkward goodbye, I departed with a strong desire to return and explore the rest of the menu. The friendly atmosphere and comfortable interior made for an experience that stands out, and I'm looking forward to my next visit.",1
15248,"Title: Pleasant Sunday Brunch with Minor Hiccups

Despite anticipating a busy Sunday morning crowd, we were pleasantly surprised to find tables readily available upon our arrival. The service was a highlight of our visit, with our server demonstrating remarkable attention to our needs throughout the meal.

The food was served promptly—a major plus—and arrived steaming hot, alongside coffee that was just as warm. I ordered the farmer's omelet, which was satisfying but could have benefited from a tad more seasoning. My cousin, on the other hand, had the Goldie lox and was quite delighted with her choice.

Our experience was slightly marred by the cramped seating arrangement. The proximity of our table to the next was so close that navigating the space without disturbing our neighbors proved to be a challenge.

Overall, the experience was positive, but the lack of personal space at our table was a bit of a letdown. Solid four stars.",1
10778,"Title: A Delightful Culinary Experience at Dos Caminos

My recent lunch at Dos Caminos was nothing short of fabulous. After a stimulating visit to the Warhol exhibit at the nearby Whitney Museum, an early lunch at this establishment was the cherry on top of the day.

The service, led by the exemplary Ash, made the experience even more memorable. His attentiveness and vibrant personality were a perfect complement to the upgraded and delicious menu. My dining companions and I indulged in a variety of dishes, from the fresh Winter Gem Salad to the sumptuous Cheese Enchiladas, the flavorful street corn, and the classic guacamole and chips. The margaritas were exceptional, and the bonus of a free Prickly Pear shot via a Yelp check-in was an enjoyable surprise.

A visit from Jesus, the manager, underscored the attentive and gracious hospitality that Dos Caminos is known for. His check on our meal was a testament to the well-run establishment.

I highly recommend requesting Ash for an outstanding service experience. We are long-time patrons of Dos Caminos and have visited all their NYC locations. This experience affirmed why we keep coming back and we will certainly return.",1
19287,"The chicken tikka at this place was juicy and flavorful, probably the best I've had. The naan was good. The chaat didn't have the right balance in terms of flavors. And the spicy  chutney we got on the side fell short and was even more disappointing given the price tag. But that chicken tikka though",0

20123,"My husband and I had a dinner experience here that matched the high bar set by our previous outing in Chicago, and it didn't disappoint. The menu is compact, giving us a confident impression that they focus on what they do best.

We started with two exceptional IPAs – the mango and pineapple-infused 'Forever Ever' from Other Half and the 'Hyperfocus IPA' from Grimm. Both were delightful.

For our main course, the double cheeseburger was a standout – despite its name, a single order brings you a satisfying stack of two patties, and the double means three. Topped with candied bacon and a sunny-side egg, it was a culinary masterpiece, easily climbing high on my top burger list. The shaved prime rib sandwich, akin to a gourmet French dip, came with gruyere and a side of horseradish that complemented the meat exquisitely, especially when dipped in the rich jus.

We also had hash browns, which were served a bit ahead of the mains. When our main dishes took a little longer, the staff courteously offered us fries to tide us over.

All in all, with the mains expertly cooked and seasoned, and every addition enhancing the flavors, this dining spot delivered an impressive meal that we'll surely remember. It remains a top contender in our burger rankings.",1
2983,"I was absolutely delighted by my culinary experience at this fusion gem, where Peruvian meets Chinese cuisine, with a twist of Cuban flavors. The lunch special's Cuban pot roast was a revelation at an unbeatable price. Complemented by a fulfilling soup and fresh salad, it exceeded my expectations. The fried rice? Out of this world! This spot isn't just a treat for the palate but also easy on the wallet, and the lack of crowds adds to the relaxed dining experience. I wholeheartedly recommend a visit—you're guaranteed to find something that tantalizes your taste buds and satisfies any craving.",1
14735,"After many years, I revisited this restaurant for lunch and was pleasantly met with familiarity that took me back in time.

17331,"I love dumplings so I have been wanting to try Mimi Cheng's for quite a while now. The shop is really cute and I love how there's someone wrapping dumplings in the store, because that's how you know the dumplings are fresh! The dumpling skin is actually amazing, with the right thickness and quite chewy, but the filling is just okay. The Mimi Cheng dumpling tastes very homemade and healthy, but it just might not be delicious or tasty enough for people to go back. I tried the May special which is the Mapo Tofu Dumplings, its wayyyy too salty. Also got the noodles, but the portion is quite small and there's only two chicken meatballs. Wish they were more generous.There's certainly room for improvement in their service, because we ordered 3 things, but one of the staff came over and asked whether he gave us an extra order. I mean, it's just 3 dishes and he can see what's on our table... I don't know, they should be more organized and smooth in serving the food to avoid confusion.",0
16374,"I recently visited the new restaurant that took over the space of the former Cutting Board and left feeling rather underwhelmed. Given that it was their soft opening, the menu was disappointingly sparse with numerous items unavailable. The dining concept mirrors that of a hotpot where diners are provided with a boiling soup base accompanied by rice noodles and an assortment of ingredients to cook in the pot. However, the portions of these ingredients felt meager at best – including only a single piece of fish tofu, one slice of ham, a lone quail egg, and a few thin slices of pork.

At $10 a meal, I anticipated a satisfying dining experience but instead was met with an unfulfilling one. The quantity simply did not meet the expectations of even a modest appetite. Regrettably, this restaurant didn't resonate with me, and I left still hungry and dissatisfied.",1
1071,"I recently dined at a local eatery and found it to be a tasty and quick option in the neighborhood. The Rice Chicken I ordered was flavorful, complemented by fresh veggies like broccoli, tomatoes, and cucumber, and served with a side of fish sauce.

I'm looking forward to trying more of their menu on my next visit. If you're in the area, I recommend giving it a go!",1
190,"I had a fantastic quick dining experience at this restaurant when I stopped in for a slice.

15172,"Title: Elegant Brunch Oasis by Central Park

Nestled on the corner overlooking Central Park, this stunning restaurant brilliantly captures the essence of a luxurious dining experience. With an enticing $45 prix-fixe brunch, patrons are treated to a thoughtfully curated selection that promises to delight the palate. My choice, the omelette, was a light and flavorful testament to their commitment to quality.

Dessert was a grand affair, with the panna cotta and chocolate cake leaving an indulgent and satisfying endnote to our meal. Each bite was harmonized with the natural light that gracefully filled the restaurant, highlighting the impressive rotunda and its striking chandelier above.

The attention to detail extends even to the restrooms, which are maintained to an impeccable standard. Coupled with attentive service, this dining spot exudes sophistication. This is a place where the dress code mirrors the refined ambiance, making it an ideal choice for a fancy date, celebrating special moments with family, or enjoying an elevated brunch with friends.",1

3643,"I recently visited a local eatery with friends and tried their signature rice rolls, opting for both the beef/pork and shrimp varieties. While the concept of sharing these dishes was appealing, the actual experience fell a bit flat. The rice rolls were somewhat bland, lacking the necessary seasoning to truly bring out the flavors, even after experimenting with several dipping sauces. Additionally, the texture of the rice rolls was too soft, making them challenging to handle with chopsticks, which detracted from the dining experience. While the concept of rice roll dishes was intriguing, I think I'll stick to the classic dim sum offerings in the future.",1

12498,"Title: A Glimpse of Greece with Hearty Cuisine

Walking into this restaurant, I felt instantly transported to what I imagine a Greek oasis would be. The decor strikes a lovely balance between brightness and the tranquil deep blue hues of the Aegean Sea. Starting with the pita, which came warm and packed with flavor, it set a high bar for the meal ahead.

For the main course, the Arni Youvetsi did not disappoint. The baby lamb shank was fall-off-the-bone tender, complemented perfectly with a bed of flavorful orzo. Seeking some greens, we added a side of asparagus that provided a fresh counterbalance to our hearty mains.

While I find the pricing on the steep side, the complimentary dessert offered a sweet endnote to our dining experience. My only gripe lies with the seating. The wooden bench seats with cushions are charming but not the most practical, especially after indulging in such a satisfying meal. It seems we are fated to be seated here each visit, which can dull the shine of the otherwise delightful ambiance.

Bonus tidbit: It seems we’re not the only ones who've discovered this gem; I spotted none other than Emeril Lagasse among the patrons!

Rating: 4/5 Stars - A taste of Greece worth savoring, despite the pinch on the wallet and the occasional seating shuffle.",1

13779,"Sunday brunch was the greatest due to horrible service. I came in with my husband and we asked for table for two. Hostess said 15-20min. After 20 minutes, she said we can sit on the chef counter or wait for the table another 20 min. When I asked her, why would not she just say 40 min to wait, she had a huge attitude and instead of apologizing she said: "" it is Sunday in NYC, I cannot tell you how long you have to wait"". Super rude, disrespectful. Why do you say time then if you cannot estimate the time. When I was waiting on the bar, I ordered smoothie that arrived 45 min later. Seriously? Also after we had appetizer, waitress took away butter knife and put steak knife instead, and then she brought bread with butter. Any logic? How we suppose to eat butter with a steak knife. Everything took forever, not a friendly service. They did not refill water. Did not ask if we wanted anything else, just bad service. Place was also very hot. It is way too expensive for the horrible service you get, unpleasant temperature and not great food.",0

11196,"Cool concept and great for the indecisive pizza lover. I always want more than one slice but struggle to finish them or just choosing one. PBTP can feed the need for portion control or bottomless pit - pun intended. You choose how much you want they weigh and warm and you Ly and are off to enjoy. I had traditional white, pepperoni, and one other that I forgot what it was called but it was delish - basically tasted like bruschetta on think crust with fresh mozzarella. YUM. The crust is thin which I can absolutely appreciate the lightness of the pizza so you don't wind up growing bored chewing excessively doughy crust .. the pepperoni was meh and the white was somewhere between pepperoni & bruschetta. Great concept I'd have it again. There were quite a few selections pretty late in the evening and I was most appreciative of that.",0
14553,"I had high hopes for this local spot, but unfortunately, the omakase experience fell short of expectations. In a city brimming with superior omakase options, this restaurant didn't deliver on the quality one would anticipate for the price. At $60 for the regular omakase and $85 for the OMAKASE by TEISUI, the offerings resembled something you'd get from a standard takeout joint rather than an upscale sushi experience.

Both the rice in the sushi and the fish itself were disappointing—the rice was consistently served cold, and the fish didn’t stand out. The chefs seemed heavy-handed with lime and yuzu leaves, which detracted from the natural flavors. The absence of luxurious staples like uni with caviar and otoro was a strange and noticeable omission in the regular sushi lineup.

Service mishaps, such as a dropped chopstick holder and a failure to provide hand towels without a request (an omakase essential), didn't help either. After accounting for the sake, the total bill for two came to around $230, a sum that simply didn't match up to the experience. Regrettably, I can't deem this place worth the cost and wouldn't recommend it amid the abundance of high-caliber sushi restaurants in New York.",1
1612,"Title: A Flawless Evening at Fresco by Scotto

Last evening, my anticipation to dine at the family-owned Fresco by Scotto was finally satiated. Tucked away on 52nd Street, this gem had beckoned for a while, especially with Rosanna Scotto's personal endorsements. On arrival, we were warmly welcomed by Scotto's mom and I spotted her brother on the floor, adding to the family vibe.

As first-timers, we were treated to a fabulous table. The cocktail experience was exceptional, with a nod to the skilled bartender. The appetizers set a high bar - the octopus was a succulent symphony of flavors with potato and tomato, while the four cheese flatbread pizza had the perfect spinach to cheese ratio on a delightfully thin crust.

The main courses maintained the momentum; the Branzino, expertly paired with quinoa and fava beans, was sublime. Similarly, the salmon was cooked to perfection. However, the star of the show was the Pappardelle with the duck - a dish that converted me into a duck admirer.

Dessert was a triumph. The Banana Pudding, layered with vanilla wafers, pudding, bananas, and whipped cream, was a revelation in a jar. The Donut accompanied by caramel and vanilla was nothing short of divine.

Do not hesitate to visit Fresco by Scotto. The cuisine is impeccable, the atmosphere is hospitable, and the experience is simply flawless.",1
16338,"Title: A Culinary Gem for Small Groups

I recently dined at a charming restaurant that's a find for any small group seeking a delightful culinary experience. Ideal for a party of four, my dining companion and I grappled with choosing from their tantalizing three-course menu. We indulged in a delectable starter of oysters, which were elevated by a zesty kimchi sauce – a standout accompaniment.

Noteworthy dishes included the succulent crab and the perfectly cooked octopus, though every item we sampled impressed us. The rice special of the day, a seaweed-infused delight, was a harmonious pairing with our meals, enhanced by two varieties of kimchi, with the broccoli rabe version stealing the show for its uniqueness.

The restaurant boasts a casual, welcoming ambiance free from any pretense. Service was nothing short of friendly and prompt, cementing the establishment as a must-visit. Don't pass up the opportunity to share and savor the well-crafted dishes on offer here.",1
13761,"No, we did not get any cupping services done here.I was having brunch with my New York Bestie. He met me in Tribeca at my hotel and we walked over to The Cupping Room. He found it online and thought it looked cute. We arrived around 11:45 AM on a Sunday morning and we were able to walk right in. We got a table in the back, dining area. We were greeted by our lovely server, Valeria. She took great care of us the whole time. Very attentive, and we never had to wait for anything. We ordered coffees right away and she brought out water. Our coffee is and water were full the whole time. We both decided to order omelettes. He ordered the country omelette and I ordered the ricotta and spinach omelette with egg whites. I also ordered a side of avocado and turkey bacon for us to share. Everything came out in a timely manner. It was delicious. I did have to send my omelette back because they gave me potatoes instead of a salad. We each got salads on the side. The portions were large, the presentation was nice, the food was delicious, the service was great, and the prices were fair. The atmosphere was cute and I would love to see what the dinner here/nightlife would be like. S/O to Valeria for making our experience that great. Overall, I would definitely recommend trying out this little gem in downtown Soho.",0
20710,"Heading to the East Village with a hankering for some spice-infused Chinese fare? Look no further than this gem offering a taste of northwestern China's finest. Specializing in noodles, from rice noodles to hand-cut varieties, this spot is a carbo-loader's paradise.

Do yourselves a favor and dive into the Xinjiang big plate chicken with bone ($24). It's a hearty dish teeming with flavor, perfect for sharing amongst a group. Don't shy away from the bones – that's where the magic happens, imbuing the sauce with depth. Stir it up and let those noodles soak in the goodness.

We ventured next into the realm of sautéed crispy baked buns with cumin ($15), a decent if unexpectedly spicy dish, though the crispy-soft dynamic fell short with a rather dry texture. A miss this round, but the spicy baked buns on Yelp still call for our attention on a subsequent visit.

The Steamed Lamb Shumai ($8 for six pieces) might challenge the uninitiated with its gamey vigor, but it's a solid choice for those who fancy the robust taste of lamb.

A side of hot and sour cucumber could have been a refreshing counterbalance, yet it missed its mark, served at an uninspiring room temperature with underwhelming flavor penetration.

Diving into the noodle mains, the Sauteed Hand Cut Noodles with Beef ($15) brought us joy with its chewy, square-cut noodles bathing in a subtly sweet tomato sauce. Take heed of the spice warnings – even 'mild' carries a kick here!

Sampling the Sauteed Rice Noodle in Traditional Sauce with Lamb ($15), we were treated to splendid textures and a sauce that nailed it.

It's BYOB for now, as they're without a liquor license, which could either be a deal-breaker or an invitation to bring your favorite bottle along.

Service, admittedly, could use a tune-up—more attentive water refills wouldn't go amiss.

It's a mixed bag, but when this place gets it right, it truly hits the spot. Just remember to keep your spice tolerance in check!",1
15082,"What an experience. Now before you decide to come realize that you will be spending big money when you come. No chance you can get off cheap. Honestly, it was worth it!  First off, the best tables are on the 2nd floor where you can overlook the whole dining area. They are big and spacious. They make you feel like a big shot when you dine here!We tried a whole bunch of things here. We started with the pasta a la presse. This is one of those cool table-side preparations where they use a duck press to get the juice out of bones and veggies. Check my pics for full detail. Other than the tableside service the dish was underwhelming. The crab cake was a good fancy version of a crab cake. We also tried the oysters from Long Island and they were fresh and delicious. The undoubted star of the show here is the prime rib. It was delicious! Now it will set you back $78 for a slice of it but in my opinion it was worth it! It comes with some shaved horseradish on pop and two dipping sauces if needed. The filet mignon was good as well. It was cooked perfectly and was tender. My wife ordered the dover sole and loved it. You can choose from 3 different choices of preparation. The sole is masterfully fileted tableside. So cool to see how they do it!Now this meal will set you back and your wallet may be hurting but it was worth it. Great service, ambiance, and food. Top top dining experience.",0
17627,"Pisillo, Pisillo, Pisillo. I honestly wish I had more time to try all of the sandwiches on the fantastic menu of this awesome establishment. You can't go wrong with anything from their list of italian sandwiches. You do you here! Grab a sandwich that speaks to you. Locals know that this place is the real deal and tourists, like myself, knows that this places deserves a visit when you are in the area.My family of three shared the #26 Pisillo sandwich since this was our first time here and we will probably be here once while in town. This sandwich is amazing. The layers that are built in this sandwich exudes freshness and quality as everything just works well together. From the salty prosciutto to the sweet roasted peppers, I absolutely love this cold cut sandwich. The sandwich is huge so honestly, you can order a whole sandwich and eat it multiple times a day.Our family went during lunch time and you saw so many people coming through to grab a bite to eat. I read in previous reviews that your bread choice might run out, which is unfortunate, but that shows how having fresh ingredients is so important to Pisillo and their sandwich art-making process. I definitely recommend anyone to stop by here when they are in town, especially before checking out the nearby tourist sites like the WTC memorial or the Statue of Liberty. You can totally get a sandwich here and carry it around on your NYC adventures.",0
12170,"It was a perfect day for a hot-pot dish. The ambiance was amazing, very upscale, fancy. We were seated right away, which was a great surprise on a Friday night.The menu, not big but satisfying. Once we placed our order we were presented with few tapas-like dishes to the table. I like those but in other places we had a wider  variety. I was looking forward for the crunchy tiny fish but they didn't serve it. Overall they were all tasty and we enjoyed them all. We had the squid pancake as an appetizer. It was tasty but less flaky than what I knew and expected. Our main dishes came very quickly after. They had no wine by the glass, which was disappointing bc not all of us drink. The bottle selection was nice but expensive and not feasible bc, again, not all of us drink. We tried the beer, almost tasteless. My friends ordered the salmon and rice hot-pot dish. I had the soft tofu stew with seafood. The salmon was overcooked in both orders, and in my seafood dish there were very few small shrimp, one larger, with its scale on, seemed  like it was thrown in just for ""good measure"", pearl-size bits of squid (weird and you don't really get to taste the squid this way) and one clam. Both dishes were very tasty, though. Service was very nice, cordial and pleasant. Restroom are fancy as the entire place and very clean.",0

My buddy also got us a nice bottle of Riesling wine which was just a right balance with the food we ordered. Everything is easily shared so we elected to go family style.Appetizers:Fried squid - not usually a big fan of squid, but this was so good!! Must get! Clams - very flavorful as well. A good kick in spice to balance everything. Chicken Satay - pretty good as well. Well seasoned and juicy. Brussel sprouts - Only dish that we were not impressed by. Kind of bland. Main course:Lobster noodles - this might be the best lobster noodles I have had. So perfect, creamy and delicious. Cod - so soft and flavorful with a hidden kick in spice. We all thought this was good!! Shrimp - get this!!! The flavors in this was amazing. Caramelized honey flavor. Just perfect!  Duck - I'm not a duck person so bias here. It was cooked perfectly, and was pretty good. Pork ribs - avoid!! This was the only main dish that we barely finished. It was super dry, but the seasoning was interesting. Nasi Goreng - wow, this was very good. Just as good as the ones in Indonesia! Overall, Wayan was impressive. It was on the pricier end but well worth it. I would make reservations ahead time and come with more people as you can try more dishes. I'll definitely try to squeeze in another trip before I leave NYC.",0
1351,"Flex Mussels delivers when it comes to curbing those bivalve desires with a modern and edgy atmosphere bathed in dim, romantic lighting. The highlight of dessert offerings is undoubtedly their selection of homemade donuts. However, the service leaves much to be desired, and one can't help but feel the pinch in their wallet particularly with the side dish menu, which seems disproportionate to their estimated food costs, like the $8 hand cut fries.

The experience is further marred by the fact that their mussel dishes don't automatically come with fries—a glaring omission given the classic moules-frites pairing. Despite this, the quality and freshness of the mussels cannot be overlooked, and the broths are notably rich and flavorful with a commendable variety of options. The classic and little neck white wine mussels, sprinkled with bacon bits and breadcrumbs, were a personal favorite. The crab guacamole starter was another win, boasting freshness and a hearty amount of crab meat.

Even with these positives, considering the quality of the dining experience relative to the price, I'm hesitant to return. While not excessively expensive, there are certainly better value dining experiences available at this price point.",1

While standing outside of the restaurant, one would note the comfortable busy bar with many variety of oysters sitting practically in front of you.  Whenever I am in SoHo, Aquagrill is always one of my stops regardless if I am having lunch or dinner elsewhere. They are the best when it comes to raw oysters. There are very few restaurants where one can find over twelve or more variety of oysters all fresh, cold, and properly shucked like Aquagrill. In addition, the rest of the restaurant seafood menu dish selections are also very good and fresh. And what is also impressive is that they maintain a wonderful list of fine wines which provides all together a delightful dining experience.",0

12279,"Title: Weekday Wins at Cozy Breakfast Nook

I recently visited a charming local spot that proved to be a weekday gem for breakfast aficionados. The standout dish was undoubtedly the eggs siniya - a delightful twist on the morning staple with eggs enveloped in a creamy tahini sauce that was both unique and satisfying.

The ambiance during the week mirrored the food: relaxed and inviting. Sipping on coffee without a rush added to the comforting experience.

However, the weekend visit told a different story. Despite the bustling crowd and the buzzing vibe, service took a hit. The shakshuka, while flavorful, was marred by delays in accompaniments, and my requests for additional coffee went unheeded.

That said, the weekend-exclusive jachnun is a culinary adventure not to be missed. This obscure pastry, sweet and flaky, served with an outstanding chili oil and tomato purée, is reason enough to brave the crowds.

In conclusion, for a tranquil breakfast and attentive service, aim for a weekday visit. But if your palate yearns for something out of the ordinary, the weekend offerings, particularly the jachnun, are well worth the patience required.",1
17738,"Consistently is something that Sala 1-9 does very well. I've been eating here for many years, ever since we they closed down their other restaurant on the Bowery and every time I go, I know I can expect the same great flavor, service and ambience.Sala 1-9 used to be something of a first date spot for me, until I met my GF, though, funny story: we met there in passing before we met officially. We happened to be shopping in the area yesterday and she had a craving for Tapas so we stopped by. I loved going to Sala 1-9 because not only was the food delicious, but the quality was consistent. To be honest, I probably haven't been here in 3 years, yet everything ate was exactly like it was years early. The Queso de Cabra y Miel is amazing, the Gambas al Ajillo is cooked perfectly (they also make sure to give you some extra bread to soak up some of the delicious oil), and the Pan con Tomate is light and refreshing. This time we tried something new to use, the Huevos con Trufa, which was packed with flavor, all of the ingredients worked together in harmony to compliment each other instead of fighting for dominance. What else to say? Staff is great, helpful and always available. The ambience is fun, I love the style inside making you feel like you're in some building from the 17th century in Spain and they are always playing some good tunes, you'll quickly become a fan of Manu Chao. Closing thoughts: don't hesitate to try this place out, and return often, you'll be glad you did.",0
1925,Visited Ootoya with a reservation for 6pm. The restaurant was pretty full but the service was attentive. The menu prices were a little bit pricier than I expected but the portion sizes are larger than you would expect so that somewhat balances it out in my opinion. I got the beef negimaki which was really tasty and the scallion and the beef together was excellent. Everyone seemed to enjoy their food very much.Pro tip: all prices include gratuity so there is no need to write in an additional percentage for tip. (Perhaps that accounts for the seemingly higher menu pricing?).,0
16155,It's a very nice Thai place. I love the inner decoration. I ordered Hor Mok Tally. It gave me pretty good amount of seafood and the thai sauce coming with it. But I wish it could have been more flavored. The scallop was a bit tasteless.,0
19935,"It's a speakeasy but it's very obvious where the restaurant is so you'll have no trouble finding it. The food was good and the vibe was better.apps - we had the tuna poke wonton taco and the empanadas both were delicious and crunchy. This was probably the best part of the meal. entree - I would recommend the braised short rib, the dish was tender and had the perfect pairing sauce. The orzo that came with it I honestly think I enjoyed even more so than the meat itself. I also tried the Peruvian chicken and didn't like it as much since it was a bit dry. dessert - you can't go wrong with the doughnuts. It was warm, crispy, soft and came with 3 dipping sauce which I didn't need since it was dusted in cinnamon sugar. The service was amazing from a busy restaurant like this. Our sever Brandon was attentive and always making sure we didn't need anything.",0
17536,"Located in Little Italy among numerous other Italian restaurants.  No wait for dinner on a Sunday night.  Pretty dark atmosphere on the inside and noticed that all the workers were males.  Complimentary French bread to dip in olive oil and balsamic vinegar!  We ordered the chicken picatta (not on the menu but they make it) which was my favorite, linguine pescatore and a pizza (forgot the name) that had artichoke, olives, mushrooms and bacon on it - delicious!  Awesome dinner and service!",0
19601,"I've lived in the area for a number of years and walked by the restaurant so many times without even noticing the restaurant. I dunno how I could possibly miss this restaurant visibly and how it never appeared in my radar. Thankfully one evening after the gym, a friend suggested we go there for dinner. I was almost certain there was no Spanish tapas place but boy was lucky to be wrong. I was so surprised and impressed at the dishes we got. We kept it light but that only means I have to go back for more. We started with the fresh anchovy fillets marinated in sherry wine vinegar and served on artisanal bread. Then we had the fantastic dish of shiitake, oyster, and crimini mushrooms sautéed in garlic sauce. The main dish was the paella Valenciana which was saffron rice with chicken, veal, Spanish chorizo, monk fish, mussels, squid, clams, bay scallops, shrimp, bell peppers, green peas, and onion. It was so flavorful and delicious we devoured everything. Keeping this on my list to go back to try more as the rest of the menu sounds like it's gonna be a treat to feast on!",0
177,"Disclosure: I was invited for a tasting. We reached there at 7:30 pm on a Thursday evening and were seated immediately even though the place was pretty full. This was my first time eating Szechuan food and the servers were very nice- they explained the menu in detail along with the different type of spices used in the food. The food is very spicy and the peppercorn tickles your tongue, so understand your spice level before ordering spicy food!!Recommendations: Mapo tofu, grilled fish hot potPros:The portion size is huge, which compensated for the above average cost. Cons:The ambiance is very average.",0

The owner is amazing, moved to NYC from Tokyo, Japan where they were ranked the #2 bar in the world.I've honestly have yet to have a better Ramen + Cocktail combination til this day. The quality, and creativity behind the cocktails are next level. Every drink is a work of art, and will have you starring at the bartender every time he's making a drink. Thinking to yourself "" I wonder what he's about to make next"". The Okinawa is my favorite Ramen dish, followed by the Sapporo Ramen.Amazing! Just amazing!",0
11074,"Title: A Nostalgic Bite at Kings Dumplings

Stepping into Kings Dumplings was like a trip down memory lane. Having been a frequent visitor of its precursor, Prosperity Dumplings, during my middle school days, I was thrilled to discover the same owner behind this new establishment in Chinatown.

My cousin's recommendation was the push I needed to finally stop by Kings Dumplings after a workout session. Walking in with the simple intention to browse the menu, I was instantly swayed to order as I recognized the familiar face from Prosperity.

The prices have naturally risen—it's now $1.50 for four dumplings, compared to the old $1 deal—but the quality has admirably stayed consistent. Granted, the dumplings seemed a tad smaller, but they were every bit as satisfying. To our delight, our order of two servings came with a bonus, totaling 10 dumplings instead of the expected 8.

While the spot has evolved from its 'hole-in-the-wall' origins to a more spacious venue, the heartwarming taste remains unchanged. I'm already looking forward to indulging in their wonton soup on my next visit. Kings Dumplings has successfully rekindled the comforting flavors of my youth, and I eagerly anticipate my next dumpling fix.",1
1043,"Title: A Nostalgic Trip with Modern Flair at The Grill

As a self-confessed enthusiast of 1960s New York City, the closing of the iconic Four Seasons restaurant was a cultural loss. But its spirit seems to have reincarnated at The Grill, which has taken its venerable place in the Seagram's Building.

The Grill impresses with immediate grandeur—a Leger dominating the lobby sets a high bar. Yet, this sense of grandiosity eases as you ascend to the bar, where the atmosphere becomes less pretentious without sacrificing elegance. The crowd is a mix of well-dressed professionals and relaxed internationals, creating a welcoming environment for post-work drinks, albeit for those undeterred by the price.

Our private dining experience was surrounded by a wealth of art, including a strikingly large Keith Haring piece. Such artistic richness added an air of exclusivity to our event.

Service didn't skip a beat—attentive and flawless throughout the evening. The culinary offerings were fitting for our sizable group, if not extraordinary. The avocado crab Louis was a pleasant start, leading to a salmon dish that outshone the filet mignon Florentine. Sides like the Jack's pie asparagus and the decadent Hunter's potatoes were crowd-pleasers. The lemon chiffon cake, while whimsically reminiscent of a wedding, rounded off the meal on a sweet note.

While The Grill might not top the list for the best food in New York, it presents a dining experience that elegantly captures the essence of an era gone by. It's a place to soak in the 'Mad Men' vibe, without the stiffness often associated with such a setting, making for a dining event that's sure to linger in memory.",1

12320,"Omg steak! I've found my new favorite steakhouse! I was here last night with friends. We were all out to celebrate st Patrick's day and I was actually debating going out but I'm so glad I did. When you walk into this place, it's very apparent that you are in for the best of New York. Everything inside is so emaculant and beautiful. I have to admit that when they said empire steak, I was thinking that it would be a cheesy touristy steakhouse. Boy was I wrong!There were four of us and we ordered the porthouse, a Cesar salad, broccoli, potatoes and creamed spinnach. We ordered the giant sharable platters! I've never had creamed spinnach before but I was with others and I'm willing to try anything once. It was a fairly pleasent experience!  I am deffinatly putting it on my new favorite foods list. The potato was absolutely cooked to perfection. I completely savored every bite of broccli! The best part was the steak though of course. Now, I've been to quite a few steak houses, but this deffinatly was the best steak I've ever eaten in my whole life. Omg... Just phenomenal! I cant say enough good things about it!The service was absolutely positively the best service I've ever received from any resturant in my whole life. The servers were so attentive and so friendly and so amazing. I will be back and will be recommending this place to anyone who asks me where to get a good steak. It's just that amazing!",0
14718,"As a Native New Yorker, I felt compelled to experience Delmonico's, and I'm pleased to report it lived up to its reputation. The steaks were impressive, yet it's the ambiance of this storied New York institution that truly shines. Nestled in the financial district, the club-like setting is adorned with enchanting murals that elevate the dining experience, making you feel like you're part of the city's rich history.

The highlight of the culinary journey was undoubtedly the baked Alaska, a visually stunning dessert with historical roots celebrating America’s acquisition of Alaska. It's both a treat for the eyes and the palate, encapsulating the timeless elegance that Delmonico's has preserved. In an ever-changing city, some traditions, like a visit to this legendary steakhouse, are worth preserving.",1
2065,"Tuesday at 5:30pm - my friend and I snagged one of the last tables here. I had previously tried to visit on a Saturday at 5pm and was given a 5 hour wait time.We ordered the salad, Cacio e Pepe and the boar ragu. The salad was fine but I had higher expectations due to the reviews. I feel I could have made a similar salad and probably would opt for a different variant of greens if I was to order next time. It took us nearly 25 minutes to get our pasta after the salad... we did not receive any explanation of when it would come and why it took so long.When we finally got the pastas - I thought the Cacio e Pepe was good. I had the version at Fiaschetteria Pistoia down the street a few weeks back and I would say this one is lighter and easier to eat more of but I love the decadence of the Fiaschetteria Pistoia version and I think I prefer it slightly to the one I had a Via Carota. The ragu was nice but not to the level of the Cacio e Pepe. I would try another pasta next time.All in all, solid pasta establishment but not worth a wait in my opinion. I can't understand why people would wait hours to dine here when you can walk into places like Fiaschetteria Pistoia which are similarly good. This is one of those places where I'd go back if someone else wanted to go but maybe not on my own and especially not if there was a wait.",0
18815,"Oh yes! DELICIOUS RAMEN and awesome service. They have plenty of options including vegetarian. Chicken buns are delicious and served with an irresistible sauce. The ramen bowls can be served with either wavy or straight noodles. Personally loved wavy. Portions are very generous for bowls. Kitchen closed while we were there but they didn't push out and let us enjoy our meal. Chicken ramen, which I ordered is a dinner time special and the sliced chicken is AMAZING. Highly recommend.",0
17184,"I came here due to the great reviews and the reputation of this place right inside the Chelsea Market! I personally loved the Adobada tacos, as the flavour of the pork with all the toppings was impeccable! Don't forget the limes that are available at the side as well. I have never had tacos that tasted so authentic and delicious! We came on a weekday afternoon, and the line moved quickly. The staff were all very hard working, efficient, and friendly even with a huge crowd, so props to them. :) There is not much seating around the area, so you will have to take the tacos to go. The prices are also very reasonable, with most tacos under $5 which is quite good given its location. I would recommend getting a few tacos to share, as you won't regret it!",0
15838,"Came for some late night eats with 2 other friends. The complimentary bowl of noodle chips with duck sauce and hot mustard would be enough to fill you up but onward Buttercup. We shared egg rolls, fried dumplings, pork fried rice and Goon Bo Duck. We had no idea how the duck was prepared but we saw it was spicy and just went for it. It was not very spicy sautéed in a brown sauce with lots of celery, mushrooms, peppers, tomato and topped with peanuts. It was good but not how I like my duck nor do I like celery much so this style is a no go for me again, everything else was very good. Service is fast and efficient because there is always a line and they want to keep things moving however we weren't rushed. This place is a treasure when it comes to serving hungry late night NYers.",0
14591,"Title: A Heartfelt Thank You to Bodega Pizza for IWD Run 2019 Support

As a participant in a special event rather than a regular diner, my experience at Bodega Pizza comes with a unique perspective. I joined Nike and the We Run Uptown Running Club for a run in celebration of International Women's Day, and the hospitality of Bodega Pizza contributed significantly to the day's success.

I extend my gratitude to the owners for opening their doors to the IWD Run 2019 participants, providing a warm space and delicious sustenance ahead of the event. The post-run atmosphere was buzzing with energy; despite the crowd and the lack of a formal queue, patience prevailed as the staff worked diligently to serve pizza, with a commendable focus on honoring the women runners.

The pizza itself? Satisfyingly tasty. Whether it was the chilly weather or the exertions from tackling those hills, each slice hit the spot. A hearty thank you goes not only to Bodega Pizza for the delectable pies but also to Nike for their organizational efforts, and to everyone who played a part in the IWD Run 2019.

Bodega Pizza not only served up great food but also a sense of community, earning itself a spot on my list of recommended eateries in Washington Heights.",1
15430,"Although service was a bit slow, the food was amazing - best Italian food I have had in NYC. I asked our waiter for a recommendation after coming in, and he told me that the tagliatelle is made in house, so I decided to get the tagliatelle bolognese. It was SO fresh! In addition, the sauce was not too heavy or overwhelming, and I was able to finish the entire dish because it was so delicious. The cheese on top was a great compliment. My boyfriend's lasagna was a little heavier in my opinion, possibly due to more cheese, but he really liked it. I REALLY want to come back to try other items (perhaps the Priest Stranglers?), but I did notice that the restaurant gets very busy quickly during dinner time. Make a reservation!",0
17964,"Amazing happy hour! This is such a cute spot, and it's in a great location. It's quiet but near noisy places too. They have really fun art there and a lovely mid century modern lounge feel. Very pretty! It would be good for a birthday. They have $1 oysters which were honestly some of the best oysters I've had in a while, and with the happy hour drinks you get one of three appetizer options included. We loved the arancini. This will be a regular spot for us.",0
13901,"Title: Disappointing Experience at One Michelin Starred Restaurant

Despite the allure of its Michelin star and a four-star-worthy ambiance, my recent dining experience fell noticeably short of expectations. We were welcomed with a complimentary amuse from the chef – a serving of fried rice with salmon that regrettably tasted as though it had been prepared hours earlier.

Opting for the omakase sushi, which featured a combination of nine pieces of sushi and one roll, my fiancé and I found ourselves overwhelmed by an excessive use of wasabi that unfortunately overshadowed the natural flavors of the fish. Furthermore, the accompanying miso soup was noticeably bland, lacking the depth one would anticipate from a restaurant of this caliber.

Having dined here in the past with a memorable experience, this visit was startlingly underwhelming. Regretfully, I am compelled to say that a return visit seems unlikely.",1
19799,"Title: A Hidden Gem Near Wall St

Stumbled upon this cozy nook while admiring the Wall St area and the Statue of Liberty, and what a delightful discovery it was! The atmosphere is uncomplicated yet inviting, perfectly complemented by the warm and attentive staff who ensured we were well looked after from the moment we arrived.

The highlight of our visit was undoubtedly the lobster roll – a masterpiece of perfectly toasted bread that managed to be both pillowy soft and satisfyingly crisp. Stuffed generously with substantial chunks of fresh lobster, it was truly a treat for the taste buds. The crab roll followed suit in quality, with delicious meat though my personal preference tilts towards the former for its meatier bite.

To warm up, we delved into the creamy lobster bisque and the clam chowder. While the chowder boasted a robust clam flavor, it was the smooth, rich bisque that won my favor for its subtlety and depth.

In short, if you find yourself nearby, do not miss the chance to savor the seafood delights at this quaint spot. Their rolls and bisques are a gastronomic pleasure that will leave you content and eager to return.",1
3111,"No frills Chinese food. Like, no frills whatsoever. Take your pick of rice combo and don't expect anything more. There is no lo mein, no soups, just the rice and the mains.  But this strategy works well for them, keeping service super fast and prices affordable for the lunch crowd.For $7.25, I got the General Tsos lunch combo with pork fried rice. The chicken was crispy and the sauce was delicious. The rice was just fine. I was in and out of the shop in under 10 minutes. Make sure to bring cash, it is cash only. The fried chicken seemed to be a popular choice as many of the other customers today ordered it, and I noticed a large platter of wings in the kitchen ready to be served up. I wish the lunch combo included a soda or something but this is still a good deal for the upper west side. Will be back when my next craving for saucy chicken strikes.",0
20494,"I came to Dong Chun Hong on a Sunday for lunch and there were a lot of people, but no wait! The place is pretty big. This is a Korean-Chinese cuisine place. If you're coming for lunch, I would definitely recommend getting the lunch combo (1 noodle dish + 1 meat dish). As you can see in the picture, they give you a larger portion of the noodles, and a small portion of the meat, but for the price you would pay otherwise (if you ordered them separately), this is a great deal at $18. Normally the tang su yuk by itself is $26 (they don't have a lunch sized portion). As far as the food goes, it was pretty good. The tang Su yuk is mostly skinny strips of fried meat in a sauce, so not super substantial in terms of meat quantity, but delicious and filling overall. The noodles were also great, albeit on the oily side. You'll probably leave here feeling pretty full and happy. Especially if you were in the mood for korean Chinese cuisine, this place hits the spot",0
14974,"Title: Brunch Bliss at Ruby's

I recently savored a brunch outing at Ruby's with friends and it was delightful. The ambiance strikes a charming note, complete with a friendly and observant wait staff. The brunch menu is impressive, catering to diverse palates, and the dinner offerings look equally tempting – I'm eager to return for an evening meal.

The standout was the sublime egg sandwich, especially the version upgraded with a poached egg nestled in a BLT – both scrumptious and photogenic. Do not skip their brussels sprouts; they're irresistibly well-seasoned. And for fry enthusiasts, their double-fried French fries hit the spot.

Ruby's certainly nailed it, promising another visit from this satisfied patron in the near future.",1
280,"Title: A Modern Twist on Korean Cuisine

I recently dined at [Restaurant Name] and had a fantastic experience. The service was nothing short of excellent, with attentive staff ensuring a delightful meal. Although I found the prices slightly elevated, particularly when compared to the hearty portions served at traditional Korean eateries, the quality and variety of the menu items were impressive.

Each dish was flavorful, but the oxtails stole the show as my personal favorite. The ssam platter also left a mark with its fresh ingredients and taste. Additionally, the watermelon cocktail was a delicious treat that complemented the meal perfectly.

For those looking to explore a contemporary take on Korean cuisine, I highly recommend this spot. However, if your preference leans towards the classic Korean dining experience with in-table grills and bubbling stews, note that this restaurant offers a different ambiance. Nonetheless, it's a culinary adventure worth trying.",1
13638,"Title: A Timeless Gem in the Neighborhood - Max Caffe

I've had a fond connection with Max Caffe since my school days over a decade ago. Each visit back to the old neighborhood isn't complete without stopping by this charming spot for my staple - a cup of coffee and a croissant. It's like a ritual, reminiscent of those tranquil Sunday mornings while the city stirred to life, the open-air setting providing the perfect backdrop.

The service here remains as kind and generous as I remember, with an uncanny ability to cater to even the most time-pressed patron. In a world where everything turns into a franchise, I secretly cherish that Max Caffe has resisted that urge. It remains unique, a local treasure that steadfastly delivers the simple joy it always has. Whether you're a first-timer or a returning old friend, Max Caffe promises that same delightful experience you'll crave to revisit time and time again.",1
18506,"My friend made the reservation and brought me along so no hassles there. If you're looking to compare this place to Jungsik, it's completely different.

The culinary journey began with an excellent Jerusalem Sesame Bagel, followed by a creatively delicious Palestinian Tartare. While the Jaffa Souvlaki entree was enjoyable, it was notably spicy and slightly over-seasoned; a side carb would have balanced the flavors more effectively. To complement my meal, I had a pretty glass of sparkling rosé, which added a delightful touch to the overall experience. Despite the entree's intensity, I would recommend this restaurant for its innovative and tasty dishes.",1
17274,"Title: A Fiery Delight for Spice Aficionados at Dry Pot Haven

I've been a loyal patron of this restaurant, both through delivery and dining in, and if you have an affinity for fiery cuisine, this is the place to be. Their specialty in dry pot – think hot pot's brothless cousin – is sure to tantalize the most seasoned spice lovers.

For those who enjoy a tangy kick, I highly recommend the Liangfen – a delightful combination of vinegar, spice, and mung bean noodles. Be warned, though: the ""Spicy"" option is not for the faint of heart, packing more heat than your extreme snack aisle favorites, though shy of those tear-inducing nuclear ramen challenges. Those new to the game might want to opt for ""Mild Spicy,"" but even that has been known to elicit a few tears, so tread lightly.

On the upside, their delivery service is top-notch; prompt and available on various platforms like Uber Eats and Seamless. You'll get a generous amount of food for your buck, making it an ideal choice for groups. My experience dining in with around ten friends was seamless, with immediate seating despite our late arrival, suggesting that crowds may not be an issue here.

If I had to nitpick, I'd urge for a more nuanced spice scale. There's a conspicuous gap between ""Mild Spicy,"" which I find underwhelming, and ""Spicy,"" which borders on overbearing. And for the spice-averse, be prepared for a rather bland ""Non-Spicy"" experience that could use a flavor boost.

All in all, the restaurant is a spicy treasure for those with a robust palate, though it could benefit from a broader range of spice levels to cater to the entire spectrum of spice enthusiasts.",1
10948,"I'd rate this establishment at 3.5 stars. The service here fell short of expectations, coming across as unfriendly and sluggish. However, the pork gyoza shone as the standout appetizer, impressing my palate. Diving into the ramen offered a novel experience, though it lacked the robust flavor I had hoped for. The kimchi fried rice did delight with its tastiness. Summing up, the restaurant delivered an average dining experience.",1
10922,"Tucked away across from the jail complex in Chinatown, this diminutive eatery is a delightful find. The made-to-order tempura catfish sandwich I tried was exceptional; it arrived piping hot, accompanied by a heap of tasty seasoned fries and a refreshingly balanced fruity lemonade. Despite the sandwich's size, which dwarfed the bun, it was a flawless blend of flavors, thanks to the slaw, intriguing sauce, and a possible hint of cheese. The cozy interior and the inviting counter staff add to the charm. With its adorable decor and scrumptious food, this little gem merits a return trip to explore more of its menu offerings.",1
1213,"I recently visited a restaurant well-regarded for its fusion Korean cuisine and was greeted by a charming atmosphere conducive to a delightful dining experience. Joined by two friends for lunch, we embarked on a culinary journey that left us content, although not entirely blown away.

Our intent to sample the seafood pancake was thwarted by a lunch menu that lacked a broad selection of traditional Korean fare. We settled for a variety of dishes, among which the Tiger Roll presented a disappointing imbalance, featuring an overabundance of rice at the expense of seafood. Similarly, the Omurice was disproportionately rice-heavy with scant traces of meat.

The clear standout was the Bimbimbap, generously portioned with a satisfying meat-to-rice ratio. Opting for the additional $4 upgrade, which included an egg souffle and potato croquette, proved to be a frugal choice that significantly enhanced the meal. Sharing a single order of Bimbimbap with the upgrade is a practical suggestion for duos seeking a fulfilling lunch.

In summary, my dining experience was a mixed bag, with the Bimbimbap (8.5/10) taking the lead, followed by savory Duck Tacos (8/10), the subpar Tiger Roll (7.5/10), and the lackluster Omurice (7/10). Despite the few misses, the value offered makes this spot worth considering for a casually satisfying meal.",1
14863,"I recently visited this restaurant and received very friendly service, which added a pleasant touch to the dining experience. The rolls I had were satisfactory, though not exceptional.

2009,"I thought this was a pretty cool spot to come in and have a late lunch. When we arrived, theres bar seating or tables and we got a table. Just a heads up, you will be pretty close to your neighbors if it's busy. We ordered the Mozzarella Balls to start, basically mozzarella sticks in a small little ball. They were tiny but honestly very flavorful, almost seemed homemade. For our meal, I got the ""OG NYC"" which is the meatball sub and my fiancee got the Mini Chicken meatballs with the Parmesan Cream sauce. The sub was good, maybe a little too ""bready"" if that's possible. The chicken meatballs were not dry which I find happens sometimes. They were really moist and flavorful. The parmesan cream sauce was very rich. I couldn't have too much of it personally. Our main server was okay, but the others we encountered were a bit nicer. I'd eat here again if I were nearby.",0

18816,"Title: A Taste of Taiwan with a Modern Twist

I was thoroughly impressed with the dining experience at this Taiwanese gem! The authentic flavors were beautifully intertwined with contemporary flair, making each dish a delightful surprise. Reservations are a smart move due to its popularity, and after tasting the menu, it's clear why this spot is in demand.

Starting with the appetizers, the Shaky fries were irresistible, seasoned with curry and served with an excellent accompanying sauce. The honey-glazed popcorn chicken gave a scrumptious modern spin on a Taiwanese staple, while the crispy silken tofu was a revelation—crunchy on the outside with an incredibly soft interior. The 'sausage party' was the star for me—an inventive dish reminiscent of Taiwanese street food featuring a sticky rice bun and flavorful Taiwanese sausage.

The entrees didn't disappoint either. The three cup chicken was a tasty nod to tradition, while the Lo ba beng put an innovative twist on a rice dish. The dry beef noodles were a savory highlight, with perfectly cooked beef complementing the noodles exquisitely.

An unexpected bonus was the bathroom, equipped with thoughtful amenities like floss picks and Listerine, adding a distinctive and considerate touch to the overall experience. I wholeheartedly recommend this restaurant for anyone keen on authentic Taiwanese cuisine with a modern edge.",1
2327,"Title: A Festive Lunch at Vaucluse

My friends and I chose Vaucluse for a pre-Christmas get-together and couldn't have been happier with our experience. Despite a few of us running late, the wait staff handled our arrival with grace and patience. To start, we shared a leeks appetizer that was a hit at the table. 

For my main course, I indulged in the epaulettes – a pasta dish that was both unique and packed with flavor. It was a delightful surprise and unlike any pasta I've ever tasted. We wrapped up our meal with the lemon dulcey dessert that was the perfect balance of tart and sweet.

A minor hiccup occurred when our side of fries was delayed due to an initial mishap in the kitchen. However, the restaurant remedied this by serving them on the house, a considerate gesture that did not go unnoticed.

In summary, Vaucluse provided a warm and accommodating dining experience, complete with delicious food that stood out from the ordinary. It was the perfect choice for our festive gathering.",1
19026,"Tucked away in a charming nook, this restaurant boasts an inviting dining room that compensates for its modest kitchen size. The staff navigated a bustling service with admirable expertise, setting the stage for an exceptional dining experience.

The meal commenced with an abundant serving of fresh oysters and seamlessly transitioned to a selection of well-crafted appetizers. Among the highlights were the mussels bathed in an exquisite Bangkok sauce—a standout in a gamut of nearly ten sauces sampled. The Thai curry also merited praise for its authentic flavors.

The dining tempo was perfectly orchestrated, ensuring each course arrived with neither rush nor delay. Though mussels were the centerpiece, the menu offered sufficient alternatives for those seeking variety. An endless supply of crusty bread complemented the dishes, inviting guests to savor every last drop of the savory sauces.

However, the French fries, including the truffle Parmesan variant, fell short of expectations, as did the lobster poutine, which was similarly underwhelming. Diners may find these sides best left unordered.

In short, this establishment is a gem for shellfish aficionados, providing a delightful array of tastes, save for a few missteps in the side dish department.",1
20349,"Title: A Delightful Noodle Haven Worth the Visit

My lunch experience at this charming restaurant surpassed expectations, especially after sampling their much-touted beef noodles. The broth struck a perfect balance of rich flavor without tipping into excess saltiness, and the beef was remarkably tender, almost dissolving on the palate. Just as impressive were the noodles, cooked with precision to avoid the pitfalls of being either overly mushy or too al dente. The accompanying vegetables added a fresh, satisfying crunch to the meal.

The small interior space was immaculately clean, awash with bright light that highlighted the adorable decor - including whimsical, hanging steamers that caught the eye. The attention to detail extended to the custom-engraved chopsticks, a nice touch that speaks to the restaurant's commitment to creating a memorable dining atmosphere. A humorous note on the wall politely discourages the removal of these chopsticks, though they are available for purchase.

In a nutshell, the meal was so enticing that it compelled me to finish every drop of soup, despite a full stomach. I'm already planning a return trip to indulge in their famed xiao long bao. This delightful spot is a must-visit for noodle enthusiasts and anyone in search of a meal that will leave you eagerly anticipating the next.",1
3451,"Title: ""A Lackluster Experience at Blue Note""

My visit to Blue Note was underwhelming, and it's not a destination I'd recommend for locals familiar with New York's vibrant jazz scene. The venue is surprisingly cramped, prioritizing capacity over comfort, which is disappointing given the steep prices. The food, like the apple tart I tried, was mediocre and overpriced.

The ambiance leans toward the touristy, with the music volume uncomfortably loud (about 90 decibels), prompting me to resort to earplugs. The lack of enforcement on their no-recording policy was another detractor, as the glow from cell phone screens recording the performance was a constant distraction.

Service was remarkably slow, perhaps a symptom of being understaffed, which only added to the evening's frustrations. Jazz aficionados would be well-advised to explore other venues in the city that offer a more thoughtful and high-quality experience. As for me, I won't be returning to Blue Note.",1
3640,"I went here with coworkers for an outing last week. The food was quite good, especially the fries. Perfectly crispy on the outside yet still fluffy on the inside. The rose sangria was good as well. A very relaxing thing to do with friends or for a date! View is very nice as well. However I was a little confused on their happy hour options. Otherwise a great experience",0
10783,"I came here for dinner on a Friday night with a group of 3 people.  I made a reservation on Yelp since I heard the place was small.  There was only a $40 prix fixe meal which included an appetizer and entree.  My friends and I ordered the jambalaya risotto, the sriracha wings, and the braised bacon appetizers.  For entrées, we ordered the Sweeney Beef, the Edward Scissor Hand burger, and the Blooms Big Fish.  The risotto was a bit too salty.  The wings and the bacon were tasty.  The entrées were pretty good.  Overall, the food was average.  The place was pretty dark that I couldn't tell what I was eating.  There wasn't much entertainment, just a fire eater and a character from It.  It was interesting to check out this place but it's more of a novelty so I doubt I would come back.",0
1202,"My first visit to this restaurant for Sunday brunch was a delightful experience. The ambiance struck me immediately, with its abundance of natural light and spacious layout that enhanced the dining atmosphere. Opting to share, my girlfriend and I indulged in the buttermilk pancakes and the steak and eggs, the latter accompanied by fries, a side salad, and perfectly cooked sunny side up eggs. Each dish, generously portioned, was reasonably priced at around $20. What stood out, aside from the delectable food, was the staff's friendliness and attentiveness to our dining satisfaction. This visit has certainly piqued my curiosity about their lunch and dinner offerings. I look forward to returning.",1
3018,Cute little rooftop! Mostly a table set up with a few bar seats. Our class of wine was $14 each. Shared guacamole which was creamy and tasty too served with regular tortilla chips. Noticed they had brunch but we didn't partake. Great view of the Empire State Building,0
11884,"If you're scouring K-town for a reliable spot that nails the vibe and flavors, look no further. This eatery has become my go-to, thanks to its unwavering consistency and its extensive menu that satisfies at any hour — it's a 24/7 operation, after all. A laid-back atmosphere with just the right amount of buzz makes for an inviting dining experience, without an ounce of pretentiousness.

The breakfast special is a real treat, offering the chance to dive into a soothing bowl of seollungtang that rivals the revered Gammeoak. Their naengmyun is spot-on too, bringing a solid rendition of this cold noodle dish to your table. When it comes to BBQ, the combos won't break the bank, yet they don't skimp on flavor or quantity. The banchan (side dishes) maintain a deliciously consistent standard, capturing the classic tastes we all crave.

For anyone with West Coast roots, the inclusion of rice noodle wraps as a side dish might just seal the deal — it did for me. And when the warmer months roll in, don't miss out on their gangang gejang special; it's not only scrumptious but also ridiculously well-priced. This place ticks all the boxes for Korean cuisine aficionados looking for authenticity, value, and good vibes.",1
17751,"Fun place to grab a bite and a drink. My boyfriend and I came to visit on Tuesday night around 6PM. The place was pretty crowded and loud, but we got a seat! The service was great as was the food. We came for happy hour, so we each got a soju drink. I got an aloe one and he got a sour, both were quite good although very small. We ordered 5 garlic soy wings (you have to order in orders of 5). They accidentally left out a wing, so they gave us 5 more wings on the house. Super nice people and great service. The wings were also REALLY GOOD (Not sure if this was because we were pretty tipsy though). We got the crunch tofu, which I enjoyed as well. Nothing special though, but a solid dish nonetheless. The truffle fries were also okay, but a good thing to munch on and tasted exactly how truffle fries should.Finally, we also ordered the uni bibimbap. I liked how there were lots of eggs in the dish, and a lot to seaweed. I honestly feel like they could have skipped the uni because there wasn't a lot of it, and you could barely taste it. Otherwise, this dish was really good! We ended up finishing everything - granted I was SUPER FULL - but had a great time. It's definitely a good place to go for a fun happy hour or dinner with friends.",0
15585,"Title: A Delightful Evening at Emeril's New NYC Spot

My mom and I, as avid fans of Emeril, were thrilled to dine at his new New York City establishment. Our early Sunday evening visit was met with tranquility and a charming atmosphere. We indulged in a pricey yet generously poured wine and Prosecco to kick off our meal.

The baked clams appetizer was a true standout, boasting five well-stuffed clams with a kick of spice and delicious greens - a perfect match with the warm pita provided. Moving onto the mains, I savored the Linguine Nero with impeccably al dente pasta and succulent lobster, while my mom enjoyed a tasty if somewhat small gumbo serving.

The dessert was a unique twist on traditional baklava, using shredded phyllo for a less sweet, but delightful experience. The meal concluded with complimentary Raspberry Custard Tarts, their warmth and slight tartness leaving a lasting impression of satisfaction.

In all, our experience was reflective of Emeril's culinary excellence, albeit in a different light. Definitely a spot worth visiting for those who appreciate fine dining with a touch of innovation.",1
14865,"Cheap and tasty food! They're most famous for the chicken leg over rice or pork chop over rice, which comes with a  chicken leg/pork chop, pickled veggies and minced meat sauce. I'll say that the food doesn't have a great presentation or beautiful aesthetic, but the food itself is tasty and satisfying (albeit a tad salty). This restaurant is split up into two sections - enter on the left door for their sit down area and enter on the right for the take-out.",0
11650,"2/14/20 - We were so pleased with our lunch on Thursday, we came back on Friday.  What can we say; we dined again on beautifully prepared dishes by Chef Paolo.  Elona, our server, took excellent care of us.  They started us off with a nice assortment of breads to go with the marinated red and green olives.  My husband enjoyed the Crocchetta Di Formaggio Di Capra (goat cheese croquet with roasted eggplant puree over mixed field greens).  It was very cold outside and soup was what I needed and wanted; so, I had the soup of the day, which was a zucchini, potato and onion puree.  It was hot, delicious and satisfying.  My husband asked if he could have fettucine instead of rigatoni Bolognese, and they cheerfully made the swap of the pasta type.  I knew I wanted to try Chef Paolo's homemade ricotta and spinach ravioli in a sage butter sauce.  They made me think of the raviolis I have enjoyed in Italy.  They were that good!  For our sweet ending, my husband had 3 scoops of chocolate gelato, and I had the ricotta cheesecake with strawberries and apples, along with fresh coffee.  We wish we lived in Manhattan so that we could enjoy Chef Paolo's dishes more often.",0
15127,"Pig Heaven, an Upper East Side staple for 35 years, has recently changed hands, but fear not—the culinary tradition lives on, with a delightful twist of new Szechuan offerings! As a connoisseur of Americanized Chinese food, my cravings were more than satisfied during my latest visit.

The General Tso's chicken was a standout—super crispy without being greasy, and the white meat option was surprisingly succulent and brimming with flavor. Accompanying the meal, the pork ribs were exceptionally meaty and boasted a fantastic marinade that shied away from the cliché neon pink, offering a naturally sweet taste.

Each dish came with the thoughtful option of white or brown rice, catering to health-conscious diners. I ventured into the new Szechuan menu and was pleasantly refreshed by the sliced pork with garlic sauce, garnished with cool cucumbers—a perfect counterpoint to the hearty meat dishes.

Yes, the prices are somewhat steep, but what you're investing in is the alluring ambiance, outstanding service, healthier choices, and high-quality meals that are neither excessively greasy nor cloyingly sweet. Pig Heaven is indeed a slice of culinary paradise on the East Side.",1
21068,"Title: A Salted Encounter at Virginia's

Rating: ★★★½

As a self-proclaimed burger fanatic, my anticipation for Virginia's famed burger led me through their doors, greeted by a cozy ambiance and commendable service. Unfortunately, the overzealous salt shaker cast a shadow on what could have been a flavor-filled experience.

Starting with the Wagyu meatballs, the tenderness of the meat and the savory sauce were promising, yet my taste buds were ambushed by an overwhelming saltiness—a sentiment echoed by family and friends who sampled leftovers.

The mussels, generously served and pleasantly plump, bathed in a ginger lemongrass curry that was a delight for the palate. However, a lighter touch of salt would have truly allowed the flavors to shine.

The much-anticipated burger, stacked with a juicy patty, Visalia onion marmalade, and an enticing aioli-cheese combo, flirted with perfection. But, yet again, the heavy-handed salt was a jarring interruption of its potential.

Redemption arrived in the form of the duck breast, a masterfully cooked medium, harmoniously accompanied by charred broccoli rabe, brûlée apple slices, and a delicate crème fraîche sauce. This dish, perfectly seasoned, was the star of the evening and alone warrants a return visit.

In summary, Virginia's culinary prowess is evident, and with a more restrained salting approach, their dishes could easily ascend from good to great.",1
15197,"Title: A Flavorful Ramen Haven Worth Visiting

I recently dined at a local ramen spot that proved to be a delightful experience. I opted for the spicy tonkatsu ramen, which was brimming with rich, savory flavors, though it lacked the fiery punch I anticipated. Fear not, heat-seekers: their ""true volcano tonkatsu"" promises to pack the punch, or you can amp up the heat with readily available tableside spices.

The noodles deserve praise for their impeccable texture – firm yet tender, they were the ideal complement to the broth. While I did hope for a more generous array of toppings, I found the bowl satisfyingly hearty.

My friend and I visited on a quiet Tuesday evening and were pleased with the immediate seating and the swift arrival of our orders post-haste. Overall, this restaurant is a must-visit spot for ramen enthusiasts in search of great taste and prompt service.",1

Only thing I didn't care for were the brussels - they were sweet which is not my thing. Butter cake was aaaalmost as good as the one at Del Frisco's, which is my fave ever. Service was excellent.",0
12130,"I ordered delivery from here tonight. A coworker said it's good but pricey.I ordered the Hijiki salad (seaweed), tuna tataki sushi bar appetizer, and 2pc mocha green tea dessert.The hijiki salad was delicious and fresh. It has shiitake mushrooms and a little lettuce. It's worth the $5. Small side salad portion. I'd order this again. Great flavors of the hijiki and shiitake together.The tuna tataki appetizer was small and overpriced at $11.50 for 6 small pieces of tuna with pepper. It was on a bed of lettuce. Though everything was fresh tasting, I would not order this again.The green tea mochi dessert came prepackaged in plastic which I wasn't expecting and had freezer burn. I did like that it wasn't super sweet. **The My/Mo mochi ice cream I bought in the grocery store was better. $4 was way overpriced for these two tiny things wrapped up in plastic. I wouldn't get these again.Although it was overall pretty good, I most likely will not be reordering from here. Plenty of other places to try.",0
12513,"Title: Quaint Charm and Authentic Bites at Little Italy

Stepping into Little Italy, you're immediately transported to what feels like the heart of a bustling New York City neighborhood, complete with the unassuming façade of a typical family-owned Italian restaurant. Admittedly, the welcome isn't as warm as one might hope for initially. But give it time—just like a slow-simmered marinara, the staff's charm reveals itself, hinting at an authentic Italian experience.

The pizza, a highlight of the menu, boasts a perfect crust and a balance of flavors that can only come from a recipe perfected over generations. It's clear that Little Italy treasures its culinary craft.

If you happen to stumble upon this spot as your first choice—like I did—consider it serendipity rather than a lack of adventure. It's worth a visit for the food alone. So if you're in the mood for a slice of genuine Italian hospitality and a pie that'll make you forget you're not in Naples, Little Italy is a solid bet.",1
18087,"I recently dined at a spacious restaurant conveniently situated near Columbus Circle. The order-and-pay-first system was efficient, allowing me to select a table with ease.

Despite this, I would recommend a visit for those in the area looking for a hospitable dining environment.",1
2446,"Title: A Vibrant Brunch Experience at Fonda Chelsea

I recently visited Fonda Chelsea and was surprised to find its popularity lagging behind its East Village sibling - unjustly so, in my opinion. The restaurant has a cozy, yet vibrant atmosphere spread over two floors that fill up quickly, especially during Saturday brunch, when the party really kicks in. Despite being a party of two amidst larger groups, the atmosphere was electric, with many reveling in the bottomless brunch options.

Service was remarkably efficient, even with the bustle, and never once did we feel neglected. What's notable is Fonda Chelsea's inclusivity regarding dietary restrictions; their dedicated vegetarian and vegan menu is a thoughtful touch that deserves applause.

For those considering a visit, be prepared for a menu that leans towards the spicier side. While this suited my palate, it's worth mentioning for those who might be less enthusiastic about heat. Overall, Fonda Chelsea delivers a delightful brunch experience and earns my hearty recommendation.",1
16668,"Title: A Triumphant Return: UOGASHI Reopens in Midtown

Upon hearing that UOGASHI had risen from the ashes of its former East Village glory and reopened in Midtown, I was eager to rekindle my experience of their distinguished sushi fare. My colleague and I opted for the $90 omakase—an homage to our past visits—and were greeted with the familiar warmth of the wait staff, whose recognition added a personal touch to our welcome.

The ambiance of the new location still echoes the charm of the original, creating a backdrop for the culinary artistry that UOGASHI is known for. Each piece of sushi served during our omakase was a testament to their commitment to quality, rivaling the delicacies one would savor in Japan and justifying the restaurant’s reputation.

While the sushi captivated our palates, the other offerings, such as the chawanmushi, didn't quite ascend to the same heights, though they remained a cut above the majority found in the city. This slight deviation from the remembered perfection was the only nuance in an otherwise impeccable meal.

The dining experience was further enhanced by the attentive pacing of each course, allowing for a relaxed, conversational atmosphere. For those with heartier appetites, the pricier omakase promises the addition of substantial dishes like tempura, which could well be worth the splurge.

My coworker’s previous insight—that the omakase outshone the sushi sets—remained at the back of my mind, hinting at the consistent quality this establishment preserves. With limited counter seating, a midweek reservation is a wise move to secure a spot in this sought-after sushi sanctuary.

In the constellation of New York City's sushi scene, UOGASHI is a star that burns bright. Offering exceptional value, it's an establishment I recommend without hesitation to anyone seeking a top-tier sushi omakase that won't break the bank. Despite being a fresh face in Midtown, it carries the legacy of its origins with honor and continued excellence.",1
14437,"Title: Brunch Bliss with Quirky Charm at Aunt Jake's

I recently visited Aunt Jake's for a Saturday brunch and found it to be a delightful gem, albeit slightly hidden. Reserving a table was a breeze with a quick call, securing a spot just 1.5 hours later. Once inside, the restaurant effused a quaint and inviting atmosphere.

My dining companion raved about the pancakes, which were both delicious and satisfyingly hearty. My choice, the eggs florentine, presented a more modest portion that leaned heavily on the accompanying salad and was accompanied by petite biscuits; a mix-up with the meat side order was the only hiccup.

Service shone with its warmth and contributed to a convivial vibe. It's worth noting that Aunt Jake's reputation for pasta is strong, and despite not sampling it at brunch, it's on my list for a future visit. In short, Aunt Jake's is a charming spot for brunch, but choose your dishes with care for the most gratifying experience.",1

Breakfast might be my meal of choice with their heavenly French toast and sublime baked eggs, but don't let that stop you from exploring their lunch and dinner menus. The penne and chicken parm are standout options that shouldn't be missed. And if you enjoy a good drink deal, you'll find yourself in the right place.

This cozy eatery boasts a welcoming bar area, complete with sports broadcasts, and a choice of upstairs or downstairs dining. The ambiance strikes a fine balance, allowing patrons to dress up or down without feeling out of place amidst the tasteful decor.

The service at Hurley's was exceptional, with a trio of attentive staff ensuring a pleasant dining experience from the moment we were seated, providing a refreshing start with water and a selection of rolls.

Though not quite a spot for a children's dinner, the sophisticated menu appealed to our adult tastes. I savored the creamy, sumptuous penne Aurora, complemented by tender chicken that effortlessly fell apart on the fork. The soft pretzels with beer cheese were a delightful indulgence, prompting me to request a to-go box.

My boyfriend enjoyed what he declared the best lobster bisque he's ever had, a high compliment from a discerning palate. His main course, a non-traditional chicken pot pie, was a revelation – flaky and brimming with succulent chicken.

Based on our experience at Hurley's, with its inviting atmosphere, impeccable service, and delectable cuisine, we would eagerly return for another exceptional dining experience.",1

19565,"This place is getting five stars from me because everything is on point! The only thing I had an issue with was the location!! They can't help that it's in the basement but man do they make it work!! 1. Reservations: I got reservations for two to catch up with a friend, and they lead us to a nice cordoned off(ish) area that had little ""Reserved"" placards on it, so we had a little bit more privacy to chat than the other walk-in. 2. Service: I don't know if it was because it wasn't crazy busy when we got there on a Friday night (6pm), or if we were sitting at the reserved spot, but the servers were SO attentive! We got three different ladies approach us before we were ready to give our order and we did not have to wait long to get our meals. My server left out my Thai ice tea check in, but remembered it when she was bringing my meal. She was so sweet and apologetic, but I was not offended or unhappy at all! Servers aren't robots, they're people too :) 3. Food: A lot of the reviews here mention the Pad Thai but I ALWAYS get Pad Thai when I get Thai food so I made a change and got Pad See Ew instead and it was delicious! Already hungry thinking about it. I also got the roti original and it was nice and crispy on the outside and soft and chewy in the middle. The curry sauce that came with it was also very spicy! So glad that I got the free Thai ice tea for the check in. It was creamy, sweet, and really hit the spot on a hot summer day. Overall pretty standard, great food. End review: I will definitely come again, and will probably keep making reservations because it got crowded once we left. We also paid in cash because all the reviews said that they only take cash, but my friend said that she paid with card last time. Make sure to ask what they take!!",0
17640,"Skip the gochu ramyun and get the so ramyun (veal broth) ONLY because if you try both, you're going to find yourself comparing the bowls and regretting it all night. Trust me, you'll be eyeing your partner's bowl as he happily slurps while you're wishing you had his instead...So Ramyun ($19): veal broth, brisket, and noodles. I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS RICH ASS BROTH. I've never had anything like this. It's light, but it's also creamy, but fatty, but you can taste allllllll the good stuff from the soup alone. It's almost like a milky broth (well, in terms of color, true too) but it tastes like cream?? I swear it tastes like a lamb broth to me, so for people who don't eat lamb, this might be a turn off because it tastes quite similar. It's a tiny portion served in a tiny stone pot, and the noodles could've been better, but I would gladly come back many more times just to drink this broth. Gochu Ramyun ($18): spicy pork broth version, this one was also really good, but incomparable to the veal broth ramyun. Honestly, any soup-y items after a taste of the so ramyun, I would've turned my nose at. It's not as spicy as you'd think, and it is also alarmingly oily, but it's pretty tasty. Heavy and rich as well, the portion is about the same as your typical Japanese bowl (much bigger portion than the so ramyun btw), and while I enjoyed this, it did taste like a regular tonkatsu ramen bowl for me. I also really disliked the white kimchi (reallllly sour) mixed into this as a topping. Still kinda cringing bout that sour taste! Pork belly was seared really well on one side, and while it was tender, I've definitely had better pork belly as well. I did make reservations about three weeks in advance to get a spot that worked for me (limited reservations on OpenTable), but place wasn't that packed for dinner on weeknight.",0

19136,"Title: A Taste of Down Under Delight in the Heart of the City

I recently had the pleasure of dining at one of the city's trendy all-day Australian cafes, a spot that's part of a charming local chain including a location in Kips Bay. My experience was nothing short of excellent.

For my meal, I chose the crispy rice bowl – a harmonious blend of fresh veggies like radish, pickled onions, and cucumber, paired with hearty halloumi and a perfectly fried egg, all tied together with a zesty aioli and ginger lemon dressing. It was a dish that married health-conscious ingredients with bold flavors in every bite.

My friend opted for the Whaleys burger, which stood out with its juicy beef patty. The addition of a fried egg, beet, and pineapple brought a delightful mix of savory and sweet to the palate.

But the true star of our meal was the side of Brussels sprouts. They arrived crispy and coated in an irresistible sauce that balanced tart, tangy, and sweet notes, making them a standout dish in their own right.

Already craving a return visit, I'm eager to delve into their breakfast selection. With tempting offerings like banana bread with passion fruit butter, ricotta hotcakes, and sweet corn fritters, it promises a slice of culinary heaven that beckons me back.

In summary, this Australian cafe is a gem worth visiting, whether for a flavorful lunch, a mouth-watering dinner, or an enticing breakfast spread.",1
1444,"I've been wanting to try out this place since there's a lack of good authentic Chinese restaurants in the Midtown East area.  I ordered the signature Lanzhou beef noodle soup for delivery since I work nearby.  It's great that the ingredients were all packaged separately and you combine them yourself.  The noodles, the soup, and toppings were all in separate containers.  You can also customize the noodles from extra wide to extra thin.  I just got the regular noodles since I like it in the middle, not too thin or too thick.  The noodles were freshly made and had a good chew.  The soup was flavorful.  There was a lot of fresh cilantro and scallions so it didn't taste very heavy.  The price was not too bad, $10 for a bowl.  I'm glad I found a place in Midtown for hand pulled noodles! I'll definitely go to the restaurant or get takeout to try their other noodle dishes.",0

I ended up getting the shrimp po boy and my friend got the Travis bowl. The Travis bowl came with a jalapeño yogurt that was phenomenal. My sandwich and fries were also pretty good. Nice bigger pieces of shrimp. The fries were a well seasoned shoe strong variety and dipped well with the sauce that went with the Travis bowl, haha. These two dishes were recommended to us and turns out great. The beer selection was about standard but they appear to keep a nice German bottled beer on hand in addition to the drafts. Would recommend this spot.",0
19702,"During a 2017 family trip to New York, my husband's restaurant choice was an absolute hit. Arriving at Black Tap, we were greeted by a line that thankfully moved quickly. The place was bustling with an inviting atmosphere that both my kids and grandkids thoroughly enjoyed. 

Despite being seated next to the busy kitchen area, the location of our table did nothing to dampen the fantastic experience. We sampled a variety of items, starting with ""The Old Fashioned"" burger which was a delectable combination of mushrooms, Swiss cheese, caramelized onions, and horseradish sauce, priced at $18.50. My husband savored the ""Texan Burger,"" loaded with bacon, aged cheddar, a crispy onion ring, BBQ sauce, and mayo for $19.50. 

However, it was the desserts that truly stole the show. We indulged in two of their signature Crazy Shakes: the indulgent ""Brooklyn Blackout"" and our top pick, ""The Cake Shake,"" both generously sized and perfectly shareable. The Cake Shake, adorned with a funfetti cake slice and rainbow sprinkles, was a sought-after treat with limited availability daily, and for $17.00, it was worth every penny.

Black Tap offered an unforgettable dining experience, with scrumptious food that resonated with all generations of our family. It's disappointing to hear that the new location at Downtown Disney in Anaheim doesn't quite live up to the SoHo standard, with a scaled-back menu and a different ordering process. For those seeking the original Black Tap vibe, the SoHo spot is the one to visit. Unfortunately, it's worth noting that Black Tap is closed until further notice due to the pandemic.",1
15179,"My friends and I were passing around in this area and smelled great pizza! Even though we were not hungry, we had to try it out!!Pros:1. Great pizza!! The cheese slice is pretty good; the right amount of sauce and the right amount of cheese. We asked for the pizza to be well done and it was perfect- neither burned nor too soggy!2. Tried the chicken roll as well (since the name sounded interesting). Turned out to be pretty tasty! Was kind of a calzone filled with mozzarella and chicken and little marina sauce.3. Accepts credit cards! (important since most slice pizza places in the city don't accept cards)Cons:1. Very little space to sit. I think they only have 2 tables with 4 chairs per table. No place/bench to sit outside either.2. The place is kinda small, so it can get crowded quickly.",0
13101,Stopped in here with my team for a quick lunch! It was really good and I'm happy we tried this place. I ordered the chicken sandwich which was nice and fresh with alfalfa sprouts and avocado. The spaghetti is what they're known for and my co workers said it was great! The bread that they give you when you sit down is cooked on a grill which was interesting.,0
17422,"Title: A Charming Evening at The Maze – Ktown's Modern Retreat

I recently visited The Maze, a delightful little gem nestled in the heart of Ktown. The venue exudes modernity with its chic decor, creating an inviting atmosphere for city-dwellers and visitors alike.

Despite its popularity, I found ample seating upon my arrival around 6pm on a Wednesday. My friend and I were seated promptly, with a charming view of the bustling street below through the expansive windows on the restaurant's far side.

One can't visit The Maze without sampling their soju cocktails; they're unique and tantalizing, albeit a tad pricier outside the haven of happy hour. We indulged in several, each crafted by a rather generous bartender, elevating our dining experience.

As for the food, we shared the fish and chips and the bacon pineapple fried rice – both were adequately portioned and hit the spot for standard fare. The service was attentive and efficient, likely aided by the lighter evening crowd.

The only snag in our evening was the draft near our window seat, which, even with my coat as a makeshift shield, pierced through, leaving me a touch chilled.

If you're roaming through Ktown with a hankering for soju-infused adventures, The Maze is a must-try spot. Just remember – it might be wise to snag a table away from the windows, unless you're resilient to the cold.",1
11124,Was fortunate enough to eat here during my stay the week before NYC was put on a strict stay at home order. Met my aunt here for brunch as it is one of her favorite spots. Understandably so! Everything was made to perfection and the service was so nice and personable from the hostesses to the servers.The complimentary fresh seeded bread and olive oil was delicious and a great mixture of flavor. We ordered the Fennel salad to share and then I had the Eggs and Wild Mushroom dish. Phenomenal! Following that I indulged in espresso with a biscotti because why not treat yourself. I can't wait to return upon my next visit to Soho.,0
11177,"**Title: Hit & Miss at a Bustling Korean Fusion Spot**

Having recently relocated to New York, I was eager to dive into the city's culinary scene. A friend's strong recommendation led me to a popular Korean fusion restaurant boasting an impressive 4.5-star rating with over a thousand reviews. Braving a stormy Monday night, the restaurant's bustling atmosphere was undeniable, a testament to its local popularity.

The server advised us to share a variety of plates, so we ordered four dishes. The Truffle Mac and Cheese had a promising start with its creamy, cheesy goodness, complemented by hints of truffle oil and micro basil. However, the truffle became overpowering, and the lukewarm temperature was a letdown.

The Korean Popcorn Chicken was a delightful surprise, reminiscent of the beloved orange chicken from Trader Joe's, but with a unique twist thanks to the sweet and spicy sauce and black sesame crumble.

Disappointment struck with the Cauliflower dish. While the hazelnut vinaigrette and spice brought a tantalizing zing, the cauliflower itself was underwhelming and under-roasted, not justifying its $12 price tag.

Our final dish, the Kimchi Paella, failed to excite. The rice's fishy aftertaste, combined with lackluster frozen-tasting mussels, overshadowed the well-cooked shrimp. Unfortunately, this dish didn't live up to the hype.

Despite the culinary missteps, the Korean fusion creations seemed tailored more for Western palates. The noise level was high, so I'd think twice about choosing this venue for an intimate first date. That said, the attentive and friendly service was a highlight in an otherwise mixed dining experience.",1
14345,This was my second time dining at Dun Huang's location in the East Village and I was just as satisfied with this experience as I was with my first. Even though it was packed when we arrived we had great food and service throughout our entire time here.Since we assumed that one of the only decent chinese restaurants would be packed on the evening of Christmas we used Yelp's wait list feature to hold a spot for us here. Once we had about five minutes remaining we made our way here from a nearby bar and informed the host. They honored our place in the queue and seated us at a table in their main dining area. Our server quickly gave us water and our menu's to look over.I was pretty hungry so I wanted something that was guaranteed to fill me up. I read a few reviews and ended up choosing the braised beef noodles ($14). Many people stated that it was both flavorful and plentiful in it's portion size. They were not lying! I finished the dish to the very last drop of the broth and was left extremely satisfied.Service here was great too given how busy it was. We were catered to by a variety of servers throughout our time here and when it came time to get the check we were able to flag down any server to grab it for us. If you decide to dine here expect efficient service and quality dishes!,0
12494,"Tried this place out this Saturday afternoon with my bf. The spot was super empty around 2 but we didn't mind. We ordered the crispy goat and buffalo chicken grilled cheeses. The goat cheese was delicious! The bacon added a nice crunch to every bite and the avocado surprisingly went really well with the sandwich. Buffalo chicken was what you'd expect - gooey spicy goodness.  I liked the pieces of jalapeño and the chicken wasn't bland like most buffalo chicken dishes. Overall, solid spot spot for a quick bite. They were out of like every beer besides Brooklyn lager and Heineken which was pretty disappointing but maybe they were just having an off day.",0
10930,"Let's be honest here...there are so many 5 star restaurants in NYC. This one really earns the 5 star rating. The vibe, the service, the staff, the food! From coat check to table service, sommelier service, view of The Vessel, ease in which the staff move you through the night is a smooth, warm, friendly and skillful developed engagement. The food is ridiculously good. From the veggie plate and house made ranch dip, butter spin for the warm Parker house rolls, the oysters we had were amazing and beautifully paired with a rose sparking wine that was AMAZING. Lamb chops and Lobster Thermidor with the amazing Madeira wine mushrooms as a side dish!!! Yeah...divine meal. The coconut creme dessert was decedent too but the Carmel popcorn treat you get at the end of your meal is ABSOLUTELY PERFECT!!! I'd take the whole bin in the kitchen if the chef would let me!! The kitchen was beautiful, crispy clean, fresh, efficient & masterful with all the ingredients! Great for a special occasion meal but also perfect for cocktails and some jazz on a Wednesday night!!!",0
2306,"Title: Savory Takeout Experience at Local Gem

My recent takeout experience from this eatery surpassed expectations, leaving me eager to dine in soon. The gyu meshi, whether paired with karaage or tomato sauce, was a highlight—tender beef complemented by flavors that danced on the palate. Particularly noteworthy was the spicy sauce gracing the karaage, which added an ideal kick.

Opting for the set is a move I'd suggest; it allows you to sample the rich, homestyle pork soup that could easily rival any grandmother's recipe. The accompanying cabbage and potato salad provided a crisp, refreshing contrast to the warm dishes.

The only lackluster dish was the eggplant with pork—its mediocrity paled in the brilliance of the other offerings. However, one miss couldn't overshadow the overall delightful meal. Would I recommend this place? Absolutely, for anyone craving Japanese comfort food with a masterful touch.",1
11317,"I'm drawn in by the large bright rectangle Roman style slices. Today's special was a vodka sauce, bufala and sausage which was a great combo of flavor and texture. I'm really digging the airy crust which the sign claims is easily digestible and 96 hours fermented. Either way it went down easily and they offer a $10 combo with glass of wine all day long. We also tried the fig prosciutto which was an eclectic taste profile combining salty and sweet (which I'm always a big fan of). Quick and convenient, inviting front of house and more seating in the back. I'll be back soon to try more flavors.",0
2261,"Mediocre at best. The interior is cute and all but that doesn't exactly save the fact that it's average food with similar if not cheaper price points nearby. My friend got the Pho Bo and I got the Roasted Duck Noodles. He seemed to like his dish. I thought mine was okay and the fact that half of it was just lettuce didn't help. Again, it wasn't bad, there are just so many better options in the area (Pure Thai Cookhouse being a prime example).",0
11561,"Title: A Crispy Bite of Delight at My New Go-To Pizzeria

I recently visited this gem of a pizzeria and it's safe to say, I've become a fan! Opting for a classic, I had a regular cheese slice and it did not disappoint. Unlike many, this spot nailed the crust—it's thinner, with the perfect balance of crispiness that doesn't leave you fearing for your dental work. The crust is just right.

The sauce was a pleasant surprise; it’s mildly chunky, adding a nice texture that you don't often find elsewhere. In fact, a delightful little ""baby chunk"" of sauce managed to escape as I took a bite, which only added to the experience.

If I had to nitpick, I'd say the only downside was my yearning for a larger slice, but that's hardly a complaint when it leaves you craving more. I’m eager to return and dive into the variety of pies they offer.

And the ambiance? Imagine the cozy aroma of a backyard fire pit. It adds an irresistibly charming touch to the experience. Count on me coming back for more of those crispy, saucy slices!",1
1132,"Walking into Cull & Pistol you see that it's a very small place. Very small. But they make the most of the small space and are very inviting. We sat at the bar because I think you have to when you want to order from the happy hour menu. Each oyster was $1.50 during happy hour. The other items like clams and shrimp were at full menu prices.  I also ordered disco fries and pistols on horseback. Their version of disco fries was quite different because it had New England clam chowder, cheese and bacon. It was delicious. And it's a large portion for only $7. The oysters were delicious as well. Very fresh and no pieces of the shell were in them. The pistols on horseback was very strange. It came out in a minuscule portion of two small tostado looking bites. The bottom layer was made from squid ink. Idk if I could recommend this. Honestly it was gone in two bites. Very salty and tasted like seaweed. I hate seaweed. But now I know. I didn't like their sparkling water because it wasn't that carbonated, but when I told the bartender there was no problem and he swapped it out for a lemon soda. All in all this is a win win situation. The food is delicious. It's reasonably priced and it's in the Chelsea Market. When you're done eating at C&P you can go out and shop or have a dessert at one of many restaurants or vendors available.",0
11000,"I recently visited a local eatery that managed to earn a solid 3.5-star rating from me. The highlight of my meal was a big, flavorful burger that didn't disappoint on taste, though it was rather messy to handle. Accompanying my burger, I tried the Dynamite Mac, which was just ok - nothing to write home about. The location is a plus, conveniently situated and adopting a cafeteria-style service that adds to the casual vibe. A downside, however, was the use of plastic forks, which didn't match the quality of the food being served. Overall, a decent spot if you're in the mood for a tasty, albeit slightly disheveled, burger experience.",1
10279,"I stopped by Villa Cemita as part of a pulsd deal ($55 for 3 courses & 4 cocktails/wine/beer for two people) and it ended up being a great deal to catch up with a few friends.From the outside, you wouldn't be able to tell that this restaurant is actually quite long and there's a large room towards the back. The entire restaurant feels modern and trendy, and there's a projector at the bar area that'd be good to watch during a game.Service throughout the entire night was friendly and attentive, and the food was tasty. Although some dishes were small, I was surprised at how nicely presented each dish was! Even the ""Drunken Nachos"" appetizer looked tidy and neat, and all the entrees were vibrant and colorful. There's also a pretty good menu of cocktails/drinks to choose from, and my friends all got a kick out of seeing one of the wine cocktails (I can't remember the name), which was served in a mini skull decanter.The regular menu is on the pricier end but it seemed on par with the nearby restaurants in East Village. I'd come back on the pulsd deal. Note that the pulsd deal comes with a slightly smaller menu, but it still had a good selection to choose from. The restaurant also serves bottomless brunch here on the weekends, so I might just have to try that next time!",0

16826,"During my stay in Manhattan, conveniently located right next door to my hotel and a stone's throw from the bustle of Times Square, I stumbled upon a quintessentially New York experience: a 99 cent slice pizza joint that delivers on its name. Open 24/7, this no-frills, hole-in-the-wall establishment serves up slices that are undeniably delicious, making it easy to overlook the lack of seating and cash-only policy.

The place brimmed with character, from the no-nonsense workers who are clearly not here to entertain complaints to an unexpected incident where a worker channeled a bit of Broadway drama, wielding a vintage golf club to ward off a troublesome beggar. While it may have been a tad tense, I couldn't help but appreciate the live ""show"" that accompanied my meal.

For around three bucks, I enjoyed not just a tasty slice of New York-style pizza but also an impromptu slice of city life. It was an experience that, much like the city itself, was both gritty and memorably authentic.",1

One of my friends made a 6pm reservation. We arrived and still had to wait 10-15 minutes, as it's a tiny place.I ordered the oriechette (sp?) pasta with pesto and sausage. Later I wish I had ordered a pizza, as they have a coal oven and it looked really good. My friend and I split the Brussels sprouts, also, which were salty, lemony, and delicious. My other friends got the linguine with clams, and said it was good, as well as some wine.Cute, intimate little restaurant and I would come here again, though probably for pizza this time.",0
16050,Walked by this establishment today while visiting NYC with my hubby and daughter from Dallas TX and saw this line longer than the Supreme line we had just been in. So obviously curiosity got the best of me and I looked it up and decided to get in their LINE yes we waited for 55 minutes roughly to try this spicy pepperoni pizza. Tbh I wasn't sure how much it cost because in reading the comments some said $5 a slice but the menu pricing was $20+. I was fully prepared to pay $90 to try this pizza. Thankfully it was $5 per slice and they were decent in size however I got 2 just because I was pretty sure it was going to be good so I didn't want to be mad at myself for only getting one slice. We paid cash to bypass the card fee. In the end I am glad curiosity got the best of us as the reviews were accurate their pizza was simply delicious. No Parmesan nor pepper needed.,0
15400,"Title: Cozy Evening with Warm Bowls and a Slight Hiccup

On a bustling Friday evening, my date and I chanced upon this ramen haunt at 7:30 pm and were pleasantly seated without a delay despite the crowd. The starter, pork gyoza, was a delectable treat—tender and juicy, it set a high bar for the meal. 

Sadly, the soju-based Lychee Invasion cocktail didn't hit the same high notes, its syrupy sweetness too cloying for our palates. 

Our main courses, the E.A.K and Zebra ramens, embellished with extra onions and garlic upon recommendation, were a tale of two broths. The E.A.K ramen offered a symphony of meaty flavors in a rich, almost overwhelmingly hearty broth that required the sharpness of onions to balance its intensity. The Zebra ramen's garlic oil accented its lighter broth beautifully, making for an exquisite slurp.

Despite the joys of the meal, there were missteps: the E.A.K ramen's temperature was a tepid letdown, and a delay in the Zebra ramen's arrival—due to an apparent oversight—dampened our spirits momentarily.

Nevertheless, the overall experience has left me eager to visit their other locations. A promising 4 stars, with room left for that extra star once consistency is nailed down.",1
18225,"Cute little French/ Spanish restaurant in west village. It's a tiny place so making reservations before going is suggested. I arrived earlier and sat in the little bar while waited for my friends. Got the happy hour rose sangria for $6. It was pretty unique but I wasn't too crazy about it. They put lots of ice too. Food was good. We ordered the mussels and scallops for appetizers. The mussels were good but the scallops were tiny. For main dishes, we got the monk fish, black rice risotto and the hanger steak. All 3 very good. For dessert we tried both tarts: lemon and chocolate. I liked the lemon one although I wouldn't order it again. Service was great.  Our waiter was very attentive and friendly. Definitely a good date spot.",0
17730,"Title: A Delightful Evening at Gogi37

Gogi37, a Korean BBQ hotspot, provided an engaging culinary experience from start to finish. Upon arrival, the modern and bustling bar area set an upbeat tone, despite the weekend crowds. The restaurant's interior exuded contemporary charm with its tasteful decor and arrangement.

The highlight was the extensive selection of meats and veggies available for our personal grilling adventure. Gogi37 didn't disappoint with their kitchen-prepared dishes either, which complemented the BBQ offerings perfectly. To cap off the night, a post-dinner drink in the lively bar brought a satisfying close to our visit.

In summary, Gogi37 delivered a well-executed evening that hit all the right notes for a Korean dining experience.",1
13116,"Title: A Step Up from Your Average Chain Pizza

As a self-professed pizza aficionado with experience stretching as far as Italy's renowned pizzerias, I approach every new pizza encounter with a certain level of expectation. At this particular joint, I indulged in both a classic margherita and an earthy truffle mushroom pizza. I must commend them for their commitment to quality ingredients, which is a leap above the standard fare.

If your pizza palate is primarily shaped by chain offerings, prepare to elevate your standards. This place will likely impress, potentially scoring a stellar 4.5 to 5 stars on your scale. However, for the pizza connoisseurs who, like me, are on an endless quest for that extraordinary slice, the experience might simmer down to a more modest 3.5 stars.

Despite the nuanced critique, I would still recommend this establishment as a reliable upgrade from the norm. Will it become my go-to pizzeria? Perhaps not yet. But it holds promise and serves as a solid stepping stone for those looking to refine their pizza preferences.",1

Our server Rosa, was very friendly and quick to answer a bunch of questions we had on the selections we were eyeing.  She made a bunch of great suggestions for the undecided.  My gal pals and I came for an early after work dinner and drinks to celebrate friendship and new ventures. Frozen Hennessy Coladas all around. It was chilled alright, Hennessy infused with a little extra in a tube to top them off, then finished with a cherry on top.I must say it's been ages since I've been to a Dallas BBQ chain so it was fun to try it again and to see how the menu has changed. It is definitely more streamlined now and has a good variety besides their signature Fried chicken. Of all the entrees we had, the star was the roasted chicken and ribs, and the choice of sauces. My fried chicken and waffles were the other favorite. The chicken was sticky with a nice honey glaze.  And the waffle had cheese and scallions inside! Whoa, I was pleasantly surprised by the first bite. Cheese gave the waffle more texture and a hint of salt to an otherwise buttery and fluffy bite. The scallions worked to give it color and complimented the cheese.The reason why the star count was rounded down was because the other two entrees were disappointing. My friend ordered steak and fried shrimp, it looked better then it tasted. And my other friend's chicken was dry. Even the sauce couldn't save it. So the food was inconsistent.",0
12841,"What an experience. If you're looking for an option to do Restaurant Week, go with this one. And if you want to eat at a fancy restaurant where you will be full, also go with this one. I was about to turn around and leave when the Indian host made me feel extremely out of place for no reason; he looked me up and down and told me that there is a dress code, and when I asked what the dress code was, he told me no sneakers or jeans. But I wasn't wearing either! So I don't know what his deal was. Why even mention it when I wasn't violating it? He also kept telling me to sit down while waiting for my friend, and after the fifth time, I told him I prefer standing. He didn't like me from the start. Anyway, my friend and I went in and really liked the decorations. Simon, our amazing and professional server, told me that each one was donated by executives and celebrities who frequent the place. We got a bunch of things: Tomato soup - my app for RW. It's pretty smooth and creamy. Standard soup, nothing mind-blowing, but it's tasty. Tuna tartare - I loved this app! It comes with a sauce on the plate that paired perfectly with the tuna. There is also a layer of cheese on top that was unique. Bubble fries - served with their secret 21 sauce. Both made with pure love. Broccoli rabe - my favorite app. It's so good! Mac and cheese - truffle-flavored. I'm not a Mac and cheese girl, but my friend really liked it. It's a big portion. Half-chicken - my RW entree: huge portion, super filling, and made with such delicious sauces and spices. I recommend you get this one if you're starving! My friend got the salmon app and cod for RW. Both were small portions, so go for those if you're keeping it light. The cod has an Asian sauce and he said it was really good. Shout-out to Simon for being so courteous! Definitely didn't have room for dessert, but I can only imagine theirs is out of this world. Their food is so first-class, and everyone, outside of the host, were welcoming and lovely.",0

If you're on a quest for that perfect spot where every bite meets the mark, look no further. This gem of a restaurant serves up a range of delectable offerings, from fried dumplings that hit the spot to scallion pancakes that won't disappoint. Unlike many competitors that shine in one area and falter in others, this eatery delivers consistency across the board.

While you won't find life-altering culinary masterpieces here, the quality, especially within the packed ""dollar dumpling"" scene, stands out. It's the kind of place that leaves you without post-meal regrets, just a pleasant satisfaction and anticipation for the next visit. With noodles and soups still to try, my taste buds are on high alert.

In a market fraught with mediocrity, this establishment rises as a beacon of decency. It's a refreshing find, and I'm truly glad to have stumbled upon it.",1
3372,"We were a big group of 9 last Sunday for a dear friend's farewell brunch. We were supposed to have our table by 1:30 but only got our table around 2PM, and to our dismay, table only had 6 seats. Other nearby tables who had extra seats gave us chairs and given it was pretty packed, we just decided to squeeze ourselves and made it work. Most if not all of us also haven't had anything so we were starving, fully anticipating brunch and a nice meal.Michael was our server and he tried to get our drinks right away but it did seem like something crazy was going on because he was taking quite awhile. We later find out that they were seriously understaffed that day. Anyway, drinks were good. I ordered The Crowd Pleaser, because well.. I was drawn to the name? Didn't disappoint. Of course all of us girls were just really hoping to be able to order our brunch entrées. It was another round of wait and we were all relieved when we were able to give our orders.But our patience was only about to be tested on another level because the food honestly didn't come out for at least 80 mins. We were by then all had different theories if the system didn't actually log our order or something crazy was happening in the kitchen. One of the girls spoke to Michael (diplomatically if I may point out) about our frustration and not that we were in a rush to be somewhere but we really chose their restaurant for our friend's special farewell brunch yet this was all happening. Admittedly, beyond our control.Michael came out with a complimentary round of champagne for us to enjoy while we wait and when the food finally came out, some of the girls literally clapped in joy. We were the last table to get our food and in fact was the very last to leave, their staff were already meet for Pre-dinner service.So why still a 4? The food absolutely made up for it. Thank goodness. I had the Crab & Avocado roll and together with the curly fries, it was delicious. By then, we were of course in better spirits and even more so when the complimentary ice cream cups to share (in 3 flavors: birthday cake, smores, banana caramel) were rolled out.More than the complimentary stuff (THANK YOU from all of us, again!) to help pacify us and our initial frustration, we did realize that they're only human and some things are beyond their control. We did see Mike continuously running around and doing his best to attend to us so we felt that it was one of those off days, and he also apologized to us and explained that this was definitely not their normal operation. They also pulled all possible stops to show that they value our business that day. And that, earned our respect.Definitely want to try their dinner service one day soon. Seems like there's too many delicious options that are absolutely worth trying. :)",0
11451,"I really tried to like this place because service was amazing. However, the food quality wasn't impressive at all. I assume this place is popular because it's conveniently located near multiple theaters and overall just at a popular location. My boyfriend and I got chicken and fish tacos. Chicken taco was just ok but the fish tacos were so underwhelming, bland, and under-seasoned. It was quite disappointing because these aren't cheap tacos. Our server recommended their Carne Asada entree which was in fact disappointing as well. Meat was way too salty and I also had a hard time chewing it. The only good thing that saved our meal were the Chips and Guac--pretty standard. Overall, I don't think I'll be returning. It's definitely a nice place with great ambiance and friendly workers, but the food is way too overpriced for the quality and portion you're getting.",0

All the food was super oily and greasy - I couldn't eat the fries nor the onion rings more than one bite. The vegan mayo didn't taste well, and had a weird texture like it was mixed with water.And for the whole evening after that early dinner I felt bad with heartburn.

10016,"Title: A Chinese New Year Feast to Remember at ECHO

For our annual Chinese New Year celebration, my family and I headed to 99 Favor Taste, and what a fantastic choice that turned out to be! From the moment we made our reservation, the attentive ECHO team ensured our experience was top-notch.

Despite the bustling atmosphere of a busy Saturday night, we were seated promptly. Our group was split into separate tables for boys and girls, which added a fun twist to the evening. The servers were nothing short of amazing, always on top of our needs and considerate of dietary restrictions by helping us select suitable broths.

The highlight of the hot pot experience was undoubtedly the endless array of delicious ingredients. We indulged in plate after plate of beautifully sliced beef and lamb. The selection of fresh vegetables was impressive, with a variety of exotic mushrooms that caught our eye. As for the seafood, it was a treasure trove with delights like soft shell crabs.

The broths were exceptional, with the herbal and spicy options being crowd favorites. Having visited many hot pots across the city, I must say 99 Favor Taste stands out for its warm hospitality and the memorable dining experience they provide.

I wholeheartedly recommend 99 Favor Taste for anyone looking to host a party or simply craving a satisfying hot pot. ECHO has earned my high praise and I anticipate many more visits in the years to come.

CHEERS to 99 Favor Taste for making our Chinese New Year celebration one for the books!",1

There was not too much pork in there, but a good amount of century egg which I loved. The curry fishballs were good too, tastes about what you'd expect.I was not a big fan of the rice dish I tried. The Beef Rib & Black Pepper Sauce on Rice was not as flavorful as I hoped. It was excessively chewy and the sauce tasted gummy (too much corn starch), and not enough flavor.

If you love chocolate, sweets, or any kind of dessert breakfast, you'll love it here. Two members of our party ordered a savory breakfast over sweets and they were pretty standard, nothing special. The real draw here is the sugar sugar sugar.We made a reservation for 11 AM on a Saturday and it wasn't too crowded, we were seated right away, but it definitely started to pick up around 11:45. The restaurant was decorated for Valentine's Day and looked so sweet and cute with little red string lights - this is definitely a great place for a date, brunch, or a meetup with friends.I had the Valentine's Day cocktail, Raspberry Lemon Drop Martini, and it was a perfect drink. To eat, I went out of my comfort zone and had the s'mores crepes and holy god, were they delicious! $15 is a reasonable price for the amount of food you get but no human on earth should be able to finish that mound of food. I definitely wanted to unbutton my pants after I ate, but I refrained because y'know, public setting.Staff was beyond friendly and accommodating. Al was very attentive and a great server, we would love to have him again. The food was also brought out pretty quickly and all modifications were correct.Bathrooms are pretty small and not super clean. Not a deterrent but just something to know before you ""go.""All in all, a great place to overload on chocolate and sugar.",0
12470,"Came here for a weekend dinner. This location is in the west side of the first location, about the same restaurant size.Was greeted by the server when coming in, and he helped putting down the belongings. It's omakase so you don't have to choose, and they will ask for allergies. The dishes start to come when the party arrives in full.Infused water: I think it's pear infused.Bread stick: soaked in sake. It got a very unique flavor.Snacks: I don't enjoy the egg and the sea urchin is a little too salty for me. The Bloody Mary has an interesting taste, but the oyster wasn't as fresh as we expected.Foie Gras: The taste is really good! The daikon reduces the fatness of the foie gras, but the richness remains. It has a little sweetness to enrich the whole dish. Very well designed.Poached King Salmon: The salmon was lightly salted. The bases was a nice balance of the purée and the tofu mango sauce, with a little chopped beans. I enjoyed the base better than the salmon.Signature Rabbit: The same dish as it's first location. The chocolate sauce is a creative addition to the tender rabbit. Together, the balance of sweet and salt give a nice touch to the meat.Wagyu Beef: imported beef from Japan and truffle from Italy. It has a very mild flavor and  extremely aromatic. This is probably the most western-styled dish and we enjoy it a lot!Sale Poached Asian Pear: The pear is really yummy and refreshing! I don't like the almond paste but that's very personal, and I still like the dessert.Good service in general. A little on the slow side as it seems to go on the fine dinning track. As soft opening, it has special price of $65 per person which was worthy.",0

Couldn't order as many dishes as we would have liked since there were only two of us, but here is what we got (and we were stuffed!!!):Top Neck Clams, XO, Almond Milk $13Not the best clams I've had, but it was more interesting with the almond milk added! Comes with 4.Beef Tartare, smoked cheddar, horseradish, Brazil nuts $17This was really good! Loved the massive amount of horseradish that they put on top.Fried Soft Shell Crab, lemon, scallions $30This was an insanely HUGE plate - definitely get your money's worth! This was done so well, perfectly deep fried and flavored. It also comes with some pieces of vegetables, watch out though, some of them can be lemon slices haha. Didn't love those.Whole Porgy with Roti $38Another humongous dish! This was also really good, fish was extremely tender. Loved the Roti that came with it too, I can eat plates of that just on its own :PAlmond Mille Feuille, fig $14Nice ending to the night, mille feuille was nice and crispy (hate when I get these and it's soggy).

You're given a plastic cup that you write your name on (lose the cup and the specials end!), unlimIted bar food, and a wristband to order. I came early on a Saturday and I was able to get seats with a larger group of friends. The breakfast basket that was part of the brunch menu was DELICIOUS, it includes: 2 sausage, 1 hash brown, and 2 French toast sticks. I ordered two breakfast baskets! If you're a bar food person, tater tots, onion rings, and waffle fries are included as well. If you prefer buffalo wings, they're also in unlimited and come mild/med/spicy. WiFi is also free and quick. I would definitely come back because it gets lively and all the students from NYU seem to visit love it here.",0
16220,"I recently dined at this French eatery and the experience was somewhat mixed. My friend's Tuna Tartare starter was surprisingly decent, despite the absence of a photo to commemorate it. Unfortunately, his experience took a dive with the Champignon Ravioli, which was overwhelmingly cheesy and led to an unpleasant end to his night. On a brighter note, my Lemon Chicken was delightful, robust in flavor, and satisfying. All in all, you get reasonable value for your money here, but I'd recommend steering clear of the ravioli.",1
20655,"My evening at Park Avenue Summer was a truly delightful experience, accentuated by the seasonally inspired décor that completely embraced its namesake. The service commenced with a warm welcome, featuring scrumptious complimentary cornbread paired with a sweet and salty butter, alongside refreshing watermelon bites.

Opting for the Garden Mule, a cocktail with a price tag of $18, I was treated to a vibrant blend of Ketel One vodka with a kick of basil, jalapeno, lime, and ginger. Though normally I steer clear of mules, this one was undeniably worth every penny.

During Restaurant Week, the three-course meal for $42 presented a tempting selection. My choices included the beautifully paired local burrata with peach, a succulent heritage pork loin (which initially arrived undercooked, but was quickly rectified by the attentive staff), and a sublime toasted coconut crème brulee that stole the show with its fusion of creamy texture and crunchy macadamia nuts.

My boyfriend's meal featured a delectable truffle-laden corn gnocchi, a flavorsome creekstone skirt steak (with a minor upcharge), and a white chocolate & citrus mousse, which, while inventive, fell a bit short in comparison to the crème brulee.

Despite a slight hiccup with the main course, the culinary journey at Park Avenue Summer was one to remember, and it left me curious and excited to see how they will reimagine their offerings and atmosphere with the seasons to come.",1
14543,"Title: Delicious Dining, High Demand, Rushed Experience

My visit to this popular restaurant was orchestrated by a friend as a birthday surprise, cleverly mitigating the notorious wait times by using Yelp's ""add yourself to the waitlist"" feature. With its stylish décor and buzzing atmosphere, it's no wonder the eatery draws a crowd, often resulting in over an hour's wait during dinner.

The staff operates with impressive efficiency, reminiscent of a well-oiled machine, which caters well to the establishment's high traffic. While this ensures a swift service and my meal arrived promptly, satisfying in both speed and flavor, this brisk pace subtracted from the personal touch traditionally valued in fine dining. The feeling of being hurried, as if on a customer conveyor belt, tainted the overall experience.

I would consider revisiting, thanks to the delicious food, but I'd aim for a quieter time to escape the rush and savor the experience more leisurely.",1
13092,Pretty good soup and sandwich spot. I had work in the area and I wanted to grab something quick beforehand and stumbled on this place. Prices were decent and pretty good options for sandwiches and soups. They had salads as well but I didn't try any of the salads. Service was quick. They take your order and then you pay once you order. There are also a few places to sit and eat as well here. Good option I think for lunch or a quick bit or some warm up soup when it's cold out.,0
10367,"Located in an alley in Chinatown, this small gem is worth the find.  Got the beef soup and it was so warm and the meat was more tender than any pho I've had in Dallas.  It was packed with meat, noodles and bok choy.  Eat this, you'll feel better. ***CASH ONLY***",0

12390,"Known for their fried chicken, I came here through the recommendation of a friend who enjoys to eat and travel. The restaurant is very small and quaint. Service was pretty friendly. No snobbiness here. We ordered the bone marrow and the foie gras to start. I really enjoyed both of the appetizers. I was pretty skeptical about the foie gras based on its presentation, but it definitely tasted a lot better than it looked. (Heads up, both of our appetizers came with bread and they also serve complimentary bread on top of that, so be ready to CARB UP if you decide to try both appetizers!). As for the entree, we ordered the fried chicken and the pigeon. Fried chicken was pretty mediocre. It wasn't bad but it didn't quite wow me the way I was hoping based on all of the reviews. I've been spoiled with jollibees spicy chicken all my life so maybe I just needed something to spice it up a bit. On the other hand, the pigeon was definitely my favorite. It was my first time having it and I found it tasting very similar to quail. The sweet potato side really complimented the tender meat. Definitely get the pigeon, bone marrow, and the foie gras if you decide to drop by!",0
15947,"Way back when I lived at East Harlem, Patsy's was our staple go-to pizza. And since they didn't deliver, we had to always do the effort of walking there and then taking a Juno (my preferred ride share even if I'm an Uber VIP coz it's more affordable ) to head back home.We never tried the restaurant itself. We always went straight to the take out area on the side where the staff works pretty fast, wait time is minimal. Always appreciated that. Our favorite was combining half of pepperoni pizza and half classic/original topped with extra cheese. We then happily bring it back home, successfully exercising full restraint to not grab a slice, and upon getting home, enjoying it immediately with our favorite beers. Perfect crust, delicious sauce, mouthwatering sinfulness that you're fully aware you'll work hard for at the gym, yet you happily eat anyway because what the heck, it's worth it!  And yes, I always have to have Tabasco hot sauce! Who can relate? ‍If you haven't tried it yet, this is one of the classic Pizzerias here that you should check off from that Great Pizza list. Now if only they were a couple of blocks away..",0

We tried Shanghai 1984 and Wife, and both were great!For the dishes, we got the rice cake, braised kitchen and the pork soup dumplings. For the appetizer we got the fish. I like the fish the most, so as the rice cake. Things were a little bit on the sweet side and not that authentic. Nonetheless they were delicious so no complaint.The price was a little on the high considering the portion. Averaged to over $50 per person and I am not even a big eater.Good service and atmosphere.",0
12002,I was in luck today as I took a peek at this pizza shop and there was no line!!! Every single time I had passed by the line was always 20-30 people deep. Guess the best time to come would be around 4pm. There were people who came right after I placed my order though. Was excited to see my spicy pepperoni slice cut out from the pie that just came out from the oven. Wished it had a non-spicy version as my lips were burning afterwards. There was a generous amount of pepperoni and the crust was crunchy. It was still temperature hot which made it a bit messy to eat. It's $4.9 which was a bit pricey but worth the try.,0
14628,"I recently visited a delightful eatery that struck a perfect balance between aesthetics and palate-pleasing cuisine. The emphasis on house-made ingredients is evident, something I greatly appreciate. The bagel with salmon was a delicious masterclass in quality over quantity, offering a burst of freshness and flavor with each bite. The homemade Greek yogurt accompanied by cherries was nothing short of outstanding. Furthermore, the latte was brewed to perfection, rounding off an exquisite breakfast experience.

Compelled by the quality of breakfast, I returned to sample their Greek lunch offerings and remained equally impressed. The moussaka served was a revelation, defying culinary norms by being both light and rich, satisfying my taste buds profoundly. This spot is a must-visit for food lovers seeking artisanal touches in a cozy setting.",1
12753,"Title: A Lunch Menu That Surprises and Delights

If variety is the spice of life, then this restaurant is the culinary embodiment of that sentiment. Their lunch offerings are nothing short of a treasure trove for taste buds, teeming with delectable options that could satisfy any craving. The general consensus is that they've perfected both pizza and pasta, and judging by the razor-thin crust pizza my colleagues enjoyed, enthusiasts of a thinner base will be in heaven here.

While I didn't indulge in the pizza this visit, I can personally endorse the spinach salad enhanced with grilled shrimp. The combination of feta, craisins, and pecans tossed in a sublime lemon vinaigrette was delightful, but the grilled shrimp stole the show; their sear and seasoning were faultless.

Missing out on the pasta felt like a culinary misstep on my part, a mistake I plan to rectify on my next visit. This establishment comes with my hearty recommendation, especially for those seeking a lunch spot that promises more than the usual fare.",1

2352,"Title: A Flavorful Evening at The Tang

Last Sunday evening, my party of three had a delightful dining experience at The Tang. Securing a reservation ensured we were seated promptly at 7 pm. Our server was exceptionally attentive, providing a detailed walkthrough of the menu, which was much appreciated as it aided in selecting dishes tailored to my taste.

For those with a penchant for Asian libations, The Tang offers an array of beers and soju, a nice touch to complement the meal.

Now, let's talk about the food - the Herbal chicken noodle soup is an absolute must-try. Its broth is rich and brimming with flavor that leaves a lasting impression on the palate. Equally remarkable is the Hot and sour noodles, a top-tier vegetarian choice with its mouth-soothing spices and flavor-boosting fried soybeans.

Though the Ma Jiang Mian Noodles, served cold, did not entirely win me over, as cold dishes aren't my preference, I can attest to their robust sesame and spice profile. However, the standout dish for the night was unequivocally the Sesame Tofu. This dish is a non-negotiable must-try, with its melt-in-the-mouth tofu draped in a potent mix of sesame paste, mustard, and chili oil – a genuine treat, especially for vegetarians.

The Tang truly impressed us with its flavorful offerings and top-notch service. My experience was so thoroughly enjoyable that a return visit is already on the horizon.",1
13748,"Upon arriving at the bustling hotspot on a Saturday night, I was greeted by a daunting line snaking out the door. Impressively, it advanced with efficiency, diminishing my wait time. 

The star of the show, a pepperoni pizza, exceeded expectations - easily climbing the ranks to become one of the most memorable pizzas of my life. Each bite delivered a symphony of flavors, highlighted by the perfect crisp of pepperoni.

Patrons should be aware of the lack of seating inside; it's a grab-and-go or outdoor dining affair here with minimal standing space inside that’s quickly occupied. Fortunately, the convenience of credit card acceptance sweetens the deal.

My verdict? This is a place I'll be revisiting. The combination of swift service and exquisite pizza has earned my unequivocal recommendation.",1
3272,"Had an incredible time dining here! The holiday-themed decor added a delightful touch, and the service didn't disappoint. The scallop entree impressed me with its perfect sear, not to mention the fair pricing. But the real showstopper was the tarte tatin—simply mind-blowing! The balance of a perfectly buttery, flaky crust combined with exquisite apples took my breath away. It's a must-try! Eagerly anticipating my next visit.",1
3408,"Still my favorite taco place and probably always will be. Ingredients just taste so fresh and soo good. Tried the queso taco carne asada this time plus the regular. The queso taco is a special item not on the menu and is made of cheese. Some were made better than others in terms of how crunchy or oily it was but overall i am going to stick to the regular but it was cool to try. I love all the extras/fix ins for your taco-avocado, pico de gallo, radish, lime, etc. Nothing fancy here and no seats you just stand and talk with friends or by yourself. It is very crowded and loud here but worth the tacos!!",0
20043,"Thanks to Ritual's dollar lunch deal, I was able to get a poke bowl here for $1. I had the (small) Blazing Tuna (Firecracker poke, avocado, jalapeno, cucumbers, edamame, bean sprouts, tempura flakes, and onion crisps) with vegetable noodles. The menu described this as 'extra hot', but it wasn't really. I really liked the firecracker sauce on the poke. I appreciated that the fish was actually marinated in the sauce (as poke should be), instead of just pouring the dressing/marinade on top. I just wish there was more fish. There wasn't a whole lot in there. If I had to pay the full $10.95 for this, I don't think it would be worth it. There's another poke spot in the area I really like, and they give more fish and more ingredients for the same price, so I think I'll continue to go there for my poke bowl fix.",0
20023,"Title: A Late-Night Haven for Soul Food Lovers

Despite the tourist buzz and crowded weekends, Amy Ruth's stands out with its consistently superb soul food. It's wise to dodge the long lines by visiting during the week or relishing a late-night feast after 3am when waits dissipate. The decor is uncomplicated with murals of notable figures adorning the walls, enhancing the simple, slightly worn cafeteria vibe—clearly, Amy Ruth's prides itself on its culinary offerings rather than its aesthetic appeal.

On multiple occasions, I've indulged in their fried and smothered chicken, each time finding it perfectly seasoned, with a delectably crisp exterior. Sides like the homemade-tasting mac and cheese, savory collard greens, and satisfying cornbread compliment the mains beautifully. While you might find the ~$20 price tag per dish on the steeper side, the hearty portions ensure you get your money's worth. In summary, Amy Ruth's prioritizes what matters most: a plate piled high with comfort, no matter the hour.",1

We enjoyed the two that we selected. I truly appreciated the amount of fresh basil on the margarita pizza, they were not stingy at all. The bruschetta pizza was spot on.. add a little fresh Parmesan cheese and it's a dance of flavors in your mouth. My only complaint is the thickness of the crust. It was a bit more thin crust than I would prefer from a NY slice. The bar area was PACKED, making it difficult to maneuver through the crowd to get to the tables and the bathroom was a little questionable, but you cannot go wrong with grabbing a few pies. Reasonably priced and delicious.",0

Should we visit again, we'll likely confine our choices to the pizza or perhaps try the buffet.",1
11511,"I was craving soup dumplings and yelped up this place before coming here. To be honest, the hello kitty buns caught my attention on Yelp. I came here around 5:30 pm  on a weekday night, and it wasn't crowded. I was seated immediately. My waiter came and I placed an order for the spicy soup dumplings and the bean curd skin. I then checked into this place on yelp so I got my free hello kitty custard buns! The food came out pretty fast and was fresh. The soup dumplings had a good amount of spice to it, and the bean curd portion was actually more than I expected. I was so full even before the hello kitty buns came out. The hello kitty buns definitely stuffed me, and almost too cute to devour... Service was wonderful, my  waiter was really efficient and kind. Pricing/portion was also good! I definitely recommend coming here when you're craving for dumplings, and of course, cute hello kitty buns! :)",0

The biscuit is fried and there is plenty of gravy to go aroundthe sweet potato hush puppies were delicious. I love hush puppies and was pleasantly surprised by the twist on the traditional dishAnd finally them greens! SAY NO MORE.

13936,"Title: Style Over Substance at Nusr-Et Steakhouse

I recently visited Nusr-Et, the famed global steakhouse owned by internet sensation Salt Bae, also known as Nusret Gökçe. Despite his reputation for working his way up from humble beginnings, it was clear this restaurant in the upscale area of Etelier is not about traditional fare but rather about selling a specific image of luxury.

The menu is a far cry from the beloved izlak burgers of Istanbul. Instead, you'll find items like the $10 ""reasonable"" sit-down burger or the extravagant $100 gold leaf burger, which is more about the 'gram than the gastronomy. Even a basic bottle of water is a $5 affair here.

As for the decor, think uninspired airport eatery, nothing more. I tried the $22 wagyu burger, which lacked the rich taste and texture one expects from wagyu—it was just pink and bland. The cheddar was forgettable, the onions were the only highlight, and the accompanying fries were plain aside from the herb seasoning. The black bun didn't mesh well with the rest of the burger, throwing off the balance.

The Instagram-ready shake looked the part but was thin and disappointingly tepid, falling short of the delicious shakes you can get from a fast-food chain.

Meeting Salt Bae himself? He's surprisingly shorter in person and the encounter consisted of a lackluster fist bump. His brand is built on social media spectacle rather than culinary excellence.

In the end, I dropped nearly $40, an amount I begrudgingly parted with for a subpar dining experience that left much to be desired. If you're seeking genuine Turkish delights or value for your money, your search will continue beyond the doors of Nusr-Et. Next time, I'll stick to the local izlak stand—or convince my boss to treat me—because I won't be spending that kind of money on hype and theatrics again.",1

Having previously dined at another location in New York, I anticipated a delightful meal at this branch, and it didn't disappoint. Pairing a refreshing beer with the savory offerings elevated my dining experience. The mac and cheese remain a personal favorite, with its uncanny bacon-esque mushrooms continuing to amaze me each visit. The spinach dip, albeit delicious, always leaves me with an excess of chips but not a dollop of dip to spare—you simply can't help but indulge.

Deciding to try the burger on this visit, I was impressed by the sumptuous flavors that even a non-vegan would savor, and as someone lactose intolerant, the plant-based menu is greatly appreciated.

However, a word of advice for winter visits: be prepared for a chill. Despite the double-door entryway, a biting draft swept in each time a patron arrived, leaving us shivering on an otherwise cozy Sunday evening. A tweak in the setup could make the experience warm in every sense of the word.",1
20826,"The inside is a little small but still sits a nice amount of people. It's decorated nicely with lights and paintings on the wall. From pictures, it looks like the portions might be small but there's actually a lot and additional rice is free so it's perfect with the sauces. The naan was SO yummy and one order came with 4 pieces. Our waiter was super attentive and asked if we needed anything. 2 people in my group got the pre fix and when they were brought dessert the waiter brought another one so we could all try. Definitely worth coming here and if there's a wait it's worth waiting! I left very full from delicious food.",0
2803,"Title: Customizable Bowls at a Cozy Spot

I've visited this restaurant on a few occasions and have consistently enjoyed the experience. Their unique offering is the build-your-own-bowl concept, complete with a complimentary serving of rice, or two if your order passes a particular threshold.

The variety of ingredients is commendable, with selections ranging from succulent fish fillets and savory spam to fresh cabbage and earthy fungus. Surprisingly, the addition of prawn chips to the mix enhances the flavors beautifully. Every element seems to contribute to a delightful taste profile.

However, it's worth noting that the restaurant is not the most budget-friendly option. They enforce a $21 card minimum, which might not be an issue if you're dining with a companion, as you'll both likely exceed the half-way mark of $10.50 each without difficulty. My bills have averaged between $14-16 per person, which signals that surpassing the minimum is not a challenge when dining in pairs.

Solo diners might find this minimum a bit steep, and while there must be single-serving choices, their popularity is uncertain—I've seldom noticed individuals dining alone here. Despite the price point, the food quality and the fun of creating your own bowl make this an enjoyable dining destination.",1
10574,"Title: A Delightful Surprise at an Upscale Eatery

Last Friday, my husband and I redeemed a Pulsd voucher at a restaurant I'd long wanted to visit, both for its potential as an event venue and for a personal dining experience. Upon arrival, the ambiance struck me immediately: the space was expansive, featuring a second floor and even a wine cellar. The design exuded sophistication, and the cordial hostess promptly ushered us to our table.

Our night was impeccably curated by Gabriel, a supervisor whose service was exemplary. My husband relished his fish taco appetizer, while I indulged in the grilled octopus—a dish so fresh and tender, it was undoubtedly the finest I've ever sampled. Our main courses, my red snapper and his seabass, did not disappoint; each showcased the remarkable seafood variety, flown in from the Mediterranean.

Dessert was irresistible, the Panna Cotta with caramelized pear and berries simply divine. Meanwhile, my husband enjoyed his baklava and a surprise dessert tray from the chef.

The visit extended beyond dining; a tour of the venue convinced me of its suitability for future events. It was the combination of the warm atmosphere, attentive service, and sublime cuisine that truly captivated me. I even had the chance to praise Executive Chef Ralpheal in person—especially for that unparalleled octopus.

In conclusion, our dining experience was exceptional. We left with eager anticipation for our next visit. A heartfelt thank you to the team for an unforgettable evening.",1

Rather than noisy, cramped spaces where you DIY your dinner with 10 of your friends, Shabushabu Macoron is intimate, peaceful, and sophisticated. This is the world's only shabu shabu omakase.Mako Okano is head chef here. The night's menu was presented in front of us by her, with a list of eight courses determined by her just like at an omakase bar. She cooks everything in front of you for you. Her movements are delicate and masterful, having studied and experimented different styles for many years.Our dinner consisted of:+ Mini wagyu steak of Miyazaki beef A4+ Yuba with uni and fresh wasabi + Sukiyaki with wagyu egg+ Tofu with white miso+ Shabushabu meats: Kagoshima beef A5, Miyazaki beef A4, pork belly, and chicken meatball+ Shabushabu vegetables: lettuce wrap (chive, napa cabbage, carrot), enoki mushroom, mochi dumpling, brussels sprouts, tomato, broccoli, and spinach+ Handmade soba with 100% buckwheat and smoked wagyu+ Japanese whiskey and black tea ice creamThe first four courses are delicate one bites before we entered the main umami paradise and ending with refreshing soba and dessert. Every one bite was heavenly, a symphony of phenomenal flavors. During the shabu shabu portion, Ms. Okano recommended which sauces to dip the meats and veggies in, ranging from ponzu to sesame paste to salted plum. It is indeed $$$$ but well worth the experience. The food quality is ace, and the opportunity to have Ms. Okano personally cook everything in front of you is something I'm willing to shell those hard-earned dollars for. The ingredients all maintain their flavors even without sauces, and there's an excellent balance of sweetness, saltiness, and umami.",0

Saying the chimichurri is 'Asian', and adding ginger and scallions to the pasta? All the Asian alcohol is Japanese or Korean - none are Chinese, as one might expect to see based on the restaurant's name.The steak was very undercooked, and I like my steak rare. The pasta was undercooked too...bits were crunchy.... If they struggle to cook pasta well, it kind of makes you wonder...!Unfortunately, the above-mentioned non-Asian parts of the meal were the tastiest. The soup dumplings were flavorless and a dense block, the cotton candy was literally cotton candy around a dried, dense block of inedible ""pork belly"".A waiter spilled sauce on one of us, and not only was he paralyzed as to what to do afterwards, we didn't get anything comped. Another waiter brought us a drink we didn't order, and thinking it was a drink as compensation, we took it - we were charged for it.Service is slow, way too many waiters all over the place. Drinks take forever to arrive. Items like steak and cake arrive without silverware so we were constantly having to ask for them, and they never once offered to change out our individual eating plates (but constantly removed our silverware).And finally, the front vestibule is non-existent so everyone has to gather on top of one another to wait, and it's freezing when the door opens all the time. The bathrooms are super basic and not in keeping with overall design aspirations of the interiors. Circulation throughout the restaurant is odd and takes up way too much space inside.Hopefully they get their act together, or they'll just be another revolving door in the East Village.

11888,"Title: A Plea for The Burgary to Step Up Their Service Game

I have been a patron of The Burgary for several years and have always enjoyed their offerings, but my latest visit compels me to address some growing concerns. While I treasure their delectable menu, the service standards have noticeably deteriorated, which I attribute to understaffing, especially during my recent late lunch visit.

During a time that borders the rush of dinner hours, it was disheartening to watch a single employee attempt to multitask between bartending, order-taking, and more. This not only delayed our meal for over an hour but also compromised the quality with our beloved totchos arriving slightly soggy, albeit still tasty, and initially missing the short rib topping which was rectified upon request.

I empathetically left a 30% tip, recognizing the strain the server was under. However, my goodwill was met with an alarming error - an $800 tip on a $27 bill due to issues with the POS system, an error I've since seen echoed in other reviews.

My review today is both a criticism and a call to action for The Burgary. While I have deep-seated fondness for your food, it's critical that you address these service issues by hiring additional staff during peak times, investing in reliable equipment, and providing ample customer service training. I write this with a heavy heart, hoping for positive changes that will allow me to continue supporting a restaurant I've enjoyed for years.",1

I had an exceptional culinary journey at this restaurant, where both the service and the food were outstanding. For fellow halal diners, the udon basil with crispy duck is a must-try; it easily became my favorite. The staff was incredibly amiable, contributing positively to the ambiance, though the place was bustling with activity. This spot is unquestionably on my list for a return visit.",1
14473,2nd x here and the trash can is the best also keirra is the best love her hair !! Had the macaroni and cheese it was awesome. the happy hour prices are good as well everything half off except drinks but drinks are like $6 .. with the trash can I got beads,0
14475,I tried the beef curry with white rice and the vegetarian curry with carrots potatoes mushrooms and cabbage. The beef was too chewy and was spicy. The vegetarian curry was good though. It has a coconut curry base and I really enjoyed it. It was quite filling too. Each bowl cost about $9 and service was friendly. It seem like yaso and curry 42 have the same staffs and food comes out of the same kitchen.,0
20815,"Stopped here with friends for a pre-theater dinner since we needed a short break from the place we usually go. It was easy to call that day and make a reservation, and the place was relatively empty when we arrived but filled up. My friends and I loved the decor!Our food came quickly and was delicious! There are a lot of options for a Thai place, and they even had mock duck (a rare vegetarian find). The flavors weren't *super strong* but the price and experience was solid enough that we'll add this to our Broadway rotation!",0
1103,"Gelati and sorbetto arranged in a cute little flower on a cone complete with a macaron on top? Everything here is so instagrammable and for me, it was love at first sight. On the recommendation of a staff memeber, I got a large cone with tiramisu / caramel gelati and the coconut / mango sorbetto with a chocolate macaron on top.  The flavor profile was amazing; rich and decadent, yet light and fruity at the same time. I thoroughly enjoyed each lick, and the macaron on top was a nice treat too. Overall, my experience at Amorino Gelato was lovely, everybody in the NYC area has to give this place a try at least once in their life.",0
13278,"Tucked away within the bustling Chelsea Market, Buddakan's unassuming exterior presents quite the treasure hunt for first-time visitors but rewards with a palatial interior that leaves a lasting impression. Its lower-level dining room boasts a regal atmosphere, setting the stage for a remarkable dining experience.

The beef dishes are the true stars here; the short rib scallion pancake appetizer delights with its flaky crust and succulent meat, perfectly complemented by the sweet crunch of Asian pear and zesty ginger. Similarly, the bold fusion of jalapenos and green apples in the oxtail dumplings offers a delectable contrast to their sweet soy glaze. 

However, not all that glitters is gold at Buddakan. The lobster egg rolls and lobster saffron fried rice, despite their generous helpings of meaty chunks, fall flat on the palate, begging for a punch of flavor to match their opulent promise.

Service at Buddakan is nothing short of excellent—attentive and incredibly accommodating throughout the meal. With prices that are surprisingly modest for this echelon of New York City's dining scene, Buddakan justly earns its spot as a worthwhile gastronomic encounter, provided you can locate it.",1
10642,"Definitely fun atmosphere, and a nice place to debrief with friends after Sleep No More!  However, not the best food.  The drinks and food are over priced, but the drinks are yummy.  The food was not worth it, and I would not recommend getting any.  The cheese platter is a total rip off.  The pizza was yummy, but there are so many places in NYC for delicious pizza for a fraction of the price!Also, the ""rooftop"" aspect is a bit misleading, because there isn't really a view of anything.",0
20908,"The talented team behind Hanoi House has expanded with a new quick service venture right next door, proving they can replicate their culinary magic in a fast-casual setting. We sampled the loaded Pho Dac Biet, a generous and flavorful $22 bowl brimming with five kinds of meat, and found it to be excellent. The Papaya Salad with Beef Jerky was equally impressive, delivering a delightful mix of textures and flavors. The Banh Mi also stood out, its quality cementing this new spot as a go-to in the neighborhood for a quick yet thoroughly satisfying meal.",1
16678,"During a spontaneous visit to Up Thai in the Upper East Side, my friend and I were pleasantly surprised to dodge the usual long wait times, despite arriving at peak lunch hour on a Sunday. Immediately, the restaurant's exquisite decor and rustic furniture set a welcoming tone for our meal.

Service was prompt and efficient, with our food arriving in good time. We shared a seafood pancake which, although flavorful, suffered from slightly dry seafood. My tofu vegetable soup was tasty but marred by an excess of uncooked napa cabbage that added an unpleasant bitterness. The accompanying steamed dumplings were satisfactory but unremarkable, akin to those found elsewhere in the city.

The standout was the green curry with tofu, which offered a robust flavor and welcomed heat, complemented well by the oil tofu. However, the dish was let down by the overly mushy rice that lacked the expected aromatic qualities.

To drink, the Thai iced tea was a hit—creamy and sweetly satisfying.

Despite some culinary missteps, the experience at Up Thai was overall enjoyable, warranting a return visit when I find myself in the UES again.",1
18721,"Really enjoyed our meal here! Came in with my family and we all really loved our food. The falafel was good quality, the bread and pita were delicious, and I really loved my lentil soup.

12660,THIS IS THE WORST PIZZA PLACE IN ALL OF NYC!!!!My pizza was so fucked up cheese sauce leaking from the box and the pizza place was 5 minutes from my house! What the hell!

15977,"Title: A Melodic Dining Experience

I recently dined at a spot perfect for the American cuisine lover, boasting an added twist that makes it stand out. The food is decent, with typical offerings like the Havana Chicken dinner—which I found to be satisfactory, albeit lacking a bit in the flavor department. However, my mom's quiche was a delightful exception that proved to be both light and scrumptious.

The real draw, though, is the electrifying atmosphere. Diners are treated to performances by the singing waitstaff, which absolutely sets the stage for an exciting pre-theater experience. It's worth noting that the place doesn't accept reservations, so be prepared for a potential hour-long wait, especially on bustling nights.

Service did not miss a beat despite the musical numbers. The waitstaff managed to deliver good service while simultaneously entertaining, a feat that certainly deserves applause. 

In conclusion, if you're seeking a meal accompanied by live performances, this restaurant is a hit. Just make sure to allot time for the wait, and enjoy the show!",1
19575,"I came here with some friends on a Sunday early evening for the happy hour menu recently. I know its a fairly new restaurant so I am willing to be lenient. They have an interesting drink menu due to the fact that they don't have a full liquor license, so many of the drinks use sake or wine for the cocktails. I ended up just getting the rose, which was good!For the food we all had some fresh oysters which weren't bad but not really my thing since they are so cold. I also had the ceviche trio which was really good, especially the fish ceviche. This would be good for sharing. I also shared the flatbread with truffle and it was delicious. Definitely recommend getting this.The happy hour prices are a great deal so I recommend going for that. They also have a brunch that sounds good, which I'd be open to trying.Unfortunately the service was a bit of a letdown. It was very slow and the waitress seemed tired and unenthusiastic about being there. I don't know if she'd had a long day or what, but it made the experience less than what it could have been with a better waiter.",0

19172,"Wonjo is usually my go-to Korean restaurant in K-Town. I have been here many times with friends for a regular meal or Korean BBQ. I also took my colleagues and my parents here before and they also enjoyed the food. There's usually a wait if you come using peak times tho. From my experience, it's probably best to come here by 5pm on the weekends. If you want to do Korean BBQ with a group, then make a reservation.They serve a bunch of different banchans (side dishes) as starters. From my experience, it's different types of banchans every time. For the food, I usually get the Sul Lung Tang (ox bone soup), Chick Nang Myun (cold noodles), or the Soon Dubu (tofu soup). BTW, you can ask for multi-grain rice (purple rice) instead of white rice for a healthier option.The service here is ok. I haven't had a terrible experience yet. Overall, I enjoy the food here.",0
167,"Title: Raku - Expectations vs. Reality

After the social media explosion surrounding Raku, I had to experience it myself to see if it truly lived up to the hype. With an obscure location lacking a clear sign, my cousin even missed it walking up and down the street. Upon our 40-minute wait (which wasn't too bad considering my mood and hunger levels), we were ushered into the surprisingly small space. Understandably, this necessitates a quick dining experience to accommodate all patrons, which didn't particularly faze me.

Service was efficient, if not particularly warm, matching the fast-paced vibe of the place. I dove into the much-talked-about noodle soups – the niku udon and curry udon with beef. The niku udon's broth lacked a punch, but was saved by the generous portions of stewed beef and tripe. The curry udon hit the mark with its fragrant broth, although it didn't suit my mom's selective curry palate. The udon itself outshone the competition with its ideal chewy texture.

Unfortunately, the pork gyoza didn't impress, lacking flavor and promptly ignored after a single bite. However, the meal ended on a high note with complimentary frozen grapes, a refreshing palate cleanser.

Overall, Raku is worth a visit, but temper your expectations and remember to bring cash. It might not revolutionize your dining experience, but it's a solid choice for good udon.",1
11221,"Perfect place to grab a quick bite after watching the King Kong Broadway show nearby. How can you beat a 99 cents pizza or 2 slices with a can of soda or bottle of water for $2.75 when you are hungry and it's cold out there? Pizza was fresh and hot as it just came out of the oven! Crust was good. Service was quick and we didn't wait for more than five minutes. And if you go there with a few friends or get a take out, $8 for a 18"" large pie is a steal! Place has no seats nor stools but there is a long bench on both sides so you can finish the yummy pizza inside the store if you wish.PS: Cash only.",0
14470,"Asset was the setting for my company holiday party. We arrived early for our 6:30 reservation, but our table for 5 was already set. After checking our coats at the front door, we were lead though the swanky first floor, up the stairs, to the equally swanky second floor. There are full bars on both levels. My boss expressed her satisfaction with the circular shaped table as we sat. Great start. We were warmly greeted by our server and quickly began deciding on cocktails. I went for The Antidote, a take on a whiskey ginger. Super good, albeit not entirely strong. An eggnog martini, a cucumber crusha' and two Wild Thoughts for the rest of the group. We also decided on two orders of wagyu pigs-in-a-blanket, which actually arrived before the drinks. The piggies were tasty, and the housemate ketchup wasn't too sweet. Wish there was a bit more of the mustard though. As the tables began to fill around us, we ordered up and down the appetizer menu. Octopus for myself, garlic shrimp, ancient grains, steak carpaccio, and bufala mozzarella for the rest. I really enjoyed the preparation of the octopus: charred, yet maintained a smooth mouth feel. The steak carpaccio was also melt-in-your-mouth good. The rest of the table enjoyed their apps, too. More cocktails arrived (I followed suit and switched to a wild thoughts - actually had a good level of spice! liked it more than the Antidote.) with our entrees. The scallops were phenomenal, and I was not shy about dipping the complimentary bread into the creamy, buttery sauce. The asparagus was kind of became an afterthought on the plate, but balanced the decadence of the butter. The steak frites and pork porterhouse were also on the table, representing the entrees with more heft. Regardless, I was stuffed with scallops and octopus. A deep sea dive for my taste buds.Finally, dessert. We couldn't resist the sounds of 15-layer chocolate cake (indeed, there are 15. I counted.) and the baked Alaska. They were both okay. In my opinion, the boozy milkshake was the best part of the dessert - put Bailey's in anything and I'm sold. Great end to the night. Thanks for taking care of us, Asset.",0
17488,"I recently dined at this restaurant for the second time and feel compelled to express my disappointment. Despite its potential, the establishment is marred by high prices that do not match the quality of the food. The service noticeably deteriorates as the crowd swells in the evening, indicating an inability to handle peak hours smoothly.

The dishes suffer from inconsistency between visits, landing squarely in the realm of mediocrity. The ceviche was particularly disappointing, afloat in an insipid liquid that did little to enhance the flavors. The guacamole, a staple in such cuisine, was unremarkable, missing both the punch of salt and the complexity of spices. Even the softshell tacos failed to impress, with a lack of vegetables and an overreliance on the same lackluster guacamole, accompanied by a token gesture of salad.

It seems the restaurant's saving grace, if any, might be its desserts, which are noted for their entertaining presentation. Nonetheless, the overall dining experience leaves much to be desired. Diners in search of a culinary delight would likely find better options elsewhere.",1
2246,"Have been here twice before I posted this review. Gotta say, wow. Not sure if this place is a secret, but every time have been blown away by the quality of the food and the service.

10779,"I wish I could give them - 5 stars. I dont care how fancy this restaurant is or how good the service was but they served me raw steak which is an absolute no no in my books. So I went to have lunch in this restaurant Sunday and everything was nice, almost. The interior, plates, seating was pleasant and the staffs were attentive. They made sure to refill my water each time even before I asked. So I could give 5 stars for all of that.Now comes the bad part. So I did the $58 2 course lunch menu. I ordered the skate cheeks for appetizer which was tangy and well cooked. The rosé wine was delicious. So all this could give the place more than 5 stars, right? WRONG!I ordered the steak and the waiter forgot to ask how I wanted my steak and I forgot to tell him too. But honestly in every restaurant the waiter always asks me that question. ALWAYS! You would think in a fancy Michellin star restaurant they would ask that but no. Two other people in my table also asked for steak and the waiter didnt ask them too. When you dont ask people how they want their meat cooked, what do you do? You cook them well done or atleast medium. I got rare. My meat was half red. My friends also got rare meat. But mine was more rare than theirs. Granted, I like my steak medium rare but this was too rare, it was raw. The knives couldnt cut any of our steaks and it required a lot of chewing. I was so hungry since I didnt have breakfast and was starving. I swallowed half of the meat and left the other half. I wish I didnt eat it at all. The horror didnt end. I had to wait for a while to get the train in the subway and once I got home I threw up, the steak was still in my throat. I love steak, this place just made me hate it. That was literally $100 down the drain.I wont be coming back here which is a pity cause I really liked the ambience and the restaurant itself.",0

Although they were out of a few menu items we had our eyes on, our server adeptly stepped in with some delightful recommendations. Do yourself a favor and kick things off with the Brioche Sticky Bun – it's a decadent treat that's absolutely worth sharing (and the extra calories). I opted for the Fried Chicken Sandwich; while it was a tad on the small side, it packed a flavorful punch that did not disappoint. Pair it with fries over the salad for a more satisfying experience. And if you're feeling adventurous, take advantage of the option to spike your fresh juice with a splash of alcohol. It's a little something extra that elevates the entire meal.",1
12639,"What a wonderful find for brunch or any other meal, really. Such a peaceful, cozy and lovely little gem of an Italian wine bar. Loved the outdoor tables but indoor seating was very comfortable. Service was just right - someone always nearby and no one ever hovering. I appreciated the kind, friendly mild mannered service I received.Food wise I loved the bread! The olive bread was divine. And they give you so much! My veggie omelette was the perfect size and well seasoned. I liked the combination of kale and zucchini with I believe goat cheese. It was pleasant and served with a handful of beautifully toasted potatoes. Now the side salad was just delightful. The mixed lettuces with different textures mixed perfectly with the very light vinaigrette. A perfect light brunch and hearty if you devour the bread! Also there is a nice wine list. I enjoyed a glass of Prosecco with my meal. They serve the brunch and regular menu late into Saturday afternoon.",0
12895,"Title: A Vegetarian Haven for Ramen Lovers on the Upper East Side

As a non-meat eater, discovering a satisfying bowl of vegetarian ramen can be quite the challenge. That's where this gem on the Upper East Side comes into play. Their vegetable ramen, immersed in a flavorsome vegetable soup base, stands out in a sea of non-vegetarian options. Not only is the quality noteworthy, but the generous portion size ensures you leave with a full belly. The only slight hiccup in an otherwise delightful experience was the ramen's saltiness, which was a touch more than my taste buds prefer. Nonetheless, for fellow vegetarians in search of a hearty bowl of ramen in the area, this spot gets my nod of approval.",1

The dip could've been a bit creamier, my brother thought it was potentially vegan. The drink was also good. Service was just lacking. I probably would've had twice as much to drink/eat if the help had been more attentive. I had to wave down someone every 15/20 minutes. They were very friendly, but seemed to have a lot of other stuff going on for a slow time of day. I likely won't be back, even though their spicy margarita is now one of my favorite drinks. I might give it one more shot to see if it was a fluke.",0
16438,"Dined in on a Weds. around 2pm for lunch and boy was I not disappointed!!! I ordered a crispy chicken taco which is a chicken tender, a fish taco and a side of rice and beans. Total meal including a bottle of water was about $14. The staff was very friendly, food looked & tasted fresh and the overall place was very clean. The flavor of both my tacos were amazing! It was definitely not what I was expecting. The style of ordering your food reminds me of Chipotle, HOWEVER the taste is totally different. I will definitely be back here as I now have another lunch spot to add to my list. I wish them much success as the food is great and decor is very inviting.",0
1451,"Upon revisiting a piece of my childhood through the NB Wing Wong, a franchise of the beloved Big Wong, my enthusiasm was quickly met with the reality of its bustling atmosphere. The staff, visibly overwhelmed, rushed to attend to the never-ending demands of hungry patrons.

I settled on the char siu noodles and beef churng fun, anticipating the familiar flavors. Unfortunately, service stumbled as our rice rolls were mistakenly placed at an adjacent table, and to my discomfort, were transferred to our table after being inspected by a neighbor's chopsticks.

As if testing my patience further, the char siu noodles arrived with an imbalance in seasoning, the pork bearing an overpowering saltiness that overshadowed the dish. Reluctantly, I focused on the noodles, leaving much of the char siu untouched.

In reflection, while the nostalgia of Big Wong lingers, the experience at NB Wing Wong fell short of the cherished memories.",1

While there, don't miss the chance to enhance your meal with the complementary array of limes, salsa, chilies, and radish—each adds a zesty flourish to your dish. Two meat-packed especials tallied up to roughly $18, a price that speaks value, though its richness suggests it's more of an occasional indulgence than an everyday affair—at least until I ramp up my fitness routine.

20112,"The ambience in this restaurant is very strange. You take an elevator up to one of the floors, they have several, and then when you get there it is decorated like a reception hall - white fabric covered tables chairs with bows and sterile fluorescent lighting. Tables are quite close together with few small ones so a party of two or three can have an uncomfortably large amount of room between them. The servers are not too friendly but get the job done. We were going on a dim sum crawl so we only ordered the peking duck. It took a while to come out and was beautiful but the server cut up pieces off of the duck and then tried to take the rest of the bird away for which we had paid $48. After much insistence she cut the legs and wings off the bird and a few more pieces of meat, but there was still a lot on the carcass and we should have made them leave it on the table.Not super fond of the way the duck, skin and hoisin was added to the steamed buns. The pieces cut were rather large and hard to bite through and the hoisin was sloppily slapped on and inconsistent so some bites had little sauce. A better way would be to chop up the meat and skin into strips. Flavor was good but not amazing.The prices of the dim sum seemed rather pricey versus other spots in Chinatown.

20903,"Title: A Slice of Ramen Heaven in the Heart of New York - Totto Ramen

My girlfriend and I, on our inaugural visit to New York, strolled a few blocks from our hotel to satisfy our ramen cravings at Totto Ramen. The restaurant's sub-street-level location was a bit confusing at first glance, yet it contributed to the quaint charm.

The pocket-sized eatery buzzed with the energy of a crowded concert—lines snaked outside, and the host efficiently managed orders while we queued for about 45 minutes. Our wait was made enjoyable by catchy hip-hop tunes and mouthwatering glimpses of steaming ramen bowls being served.

Seated elbow-to-elbow with fellow diners, we dove into a whirlwind dining experience. The Mega Ramen, a $16 bowl brimming with umami-rich char siu pork ensconced in a robust chicken broth, lived up to its reputation. The dish delivered on flavor, with portion sizes hitting that perfect mark of satisfaction. 

Yes, the prices seemed steep, but the culinary excellence justified the expense. A heads up for future diners: bring cash, as it's the only payment they accept.

Despite the hustle and space constraints, Totto Ramen is a must-try for ramen enthusiasts. We left already planning our next visit, eager for another round of their sublime noodle soup.",1
1977,"Title: A Culinary Send-off to Remember

In the midst of the world turning inward to ""flatten the curve,"" my friends and I found ourselves partaking in a final feast at a local gem whose name will remain etched in our memories, particularly as our last group meal before quarantine.

Upon arrival, we were whisked away to a cozy booth perfectly suited for our candid conversations. Without delay, we dove into an array of mouth-watering dishes, embodying the essence of gluttony.

The salty pork belly and kara-age fried chicken were a symphony of flavors, while the tuna tataki melted on the tongue. Anchovy fried potatoes and scallops aburi added rich, oceanic layers to the spread. The hot squid kicked up the heat, and the black miso chicken was a delightful twist. The unagi don bowl was a savory delight, and the pork katsu curry over rice was a revelation—the fishstick-like fingers of pork coupled with the sumptuous curry claiming the title of the best I’ve had in recent memory.

Our feast didn't stop with just one round; favorites were re-ordered, with the kara-age and black miso chicken making an encore. Sake flowed freely, with each bottle complementing the culinary adventure.

All in all, each dish was impeccably crafted and left an indelible mark on our palates. It was a dining experience we shared with gusto, our friend with dietary restrictions included, making it all the more special. This restaurant proved to be an unforgettable gastronomic sanctuary before the isolation, and I eagerly await the day we can return.",1

If you're not hitting up Gnocco for your Italian fix, you're missing out, big time. Don't let the distance from the subway deter you; this place is the definition of ""worth it."" I ventured in with a party of seven others on a bustling Friday night and wasn't disappointed.

From the get-go, service was on point. Our wine—a sublime Red Blend that danced wonderfully with every dish—arrived in a flash. And despite the crowd, our food followed suit, appearing within a mere 15 minutes.

Let's talk about the holy grail of their menu: the pasta. Their gnocchi was so fresh, it could put street style to shame. And the pizza? Imagine a plain cheese base, elevated with spicy salami and pepperoni, each bite as light and airy as the crust was perfectly crisp.

In a nutshell, Gnocco brings the fire with outstanding wine, pasta, and pizza, all delivered with top-notch service. Skip this place, and you'll be doing your taste buds a grave injustice.",1

Though service was nice and friendly! They were very attentive with giving us water and taking our order :)Cleanliness: 5Price: 4.5Quality: 5Service: 5Overall Experience: 4.5",0
10192,"I love this place. A coworker recommended this to me and I stopped there on a whim. The place was dark yet inviting, intriguing and sophisticated. The bar big and comfy. I sat at the bar and was in awe of the restaurants beauty. The majority of people there were still in their work attire and clearly in need of a drink to end their long day. The bartender was really sweet and greeted me right away. I ordered the Mac and cheese; which was delicious... a little too creamy for my liking, but delicious nonetheless. I wasn't going to have dessert, until I saw sticky toffee pudding on the menu. Who doesn't love sticky toffee pudding? I had to have it. The presentation of it was great, they poured flambé caramel sauce over it, when they brought it out. The cake unfortunately, had big pieces of dates or figs, which I didn't like. But otherwise the whole experience was great! I will be back.",0
2986,"Started with just a couple dishes to bring us into lunch. Fried brussel sprouts - very crispy, then a different little bit of a kick in terms of spice. But overall a very nice and light dish to keep the meal moving forward. Also got the cucumber and thinly sliced pork - lovely refreshing dish, sweet and savory, allowing the meat to come thru. Finally moving onto the mains - BBQ ribs - oh so juicy, sweet, the right amount of fat (just enough to keep the moisture, but not too much to make you guilty). And to top it all off the tomatoe beef stew. Oh my goodness, I don't know where to begin, they brought it out in a giant beautiful pot, flame underneath still cooking the beef. The soup was sweet, sharp, and acidic, the perfect amount of bite to let you keepe eating and more. The beef thinly sliced to soak up the juice, and add some meatiness to the soup. The tofu soaks it all up. And hidden in the soup is bundles of noodles full of flavor. I skipped the rice and went straight for the soup - I can eat that everyday, nothing could be better on a cold winter day.",0
20202,"Title: A Gem in the Heart of the City - Tetsu

As a new contender for my go-to downtown haunt, Tetsu immediately captured my affection on the very first visit. The atmosphere marries a laid-back charm with a modern, roomy interior that never feels overcrowded. The highlight for a culinary novice like myself is the open kitchen, offering a front-row seat to the culinary ballet that unfolds within.

An irresistible Monday special lured my friend and me in with the promise of a craft beer or glass of wine for a mere $25. We indulged in the Masa Toro roll to start, a delicacy that, despite its $35 price tag, glides across the palate with a buttery ease that eclipses the need for any frills—though a dab of soy and wasabi is a welcome touch.

For the main course, the classic beef burgers redefined my burger benchmarks, boasting simplicity with a nuanced flavor profile reminiscent of beef tartare. This is a burger that stands proudly without the crutch of condiments.

Tetsu has etched itself into my culinary map, and I'm already plotting a return for their spicy cod roe fish pasta and other signature delights. It's a resounding yes from me; Tetsu is a must-try.",1
13488,"My favorite Hells Kitchen restaurant said a 40 minute wait for dinner, so we backtracked to a new Thai place I had noticed and were seated immediately. Taladwat, what a discovery! You'll be eating casual Thai style at communal picnic tables, but don't let that stop you from going.Talk about the joy of cooking, this was our joy of eating! I travel to Thailand annually and this authentic temple ""wat"" festival food is pretty much what you can get in the Thai countryside outside metropolitan areas. Instead of bread you get a Green Leaf Basket assortment to munch on. Even the serving sizes are similar to Thailand. You don't get heaping mounds of food per dish, and are encouraged to order several dishes and share family style. Dinner selections are 2 for $18, and I think each person will need at least 2 plus shared appetizer to get full.With five of us, that meant tasting at least a dozen dishes! Not every dish was 5-star worthy, but my faves were so delicious and flavorful, including: Kaffir Chicken with string beans and Tepo Curry Pork Belly with water spinach. I wish there was more broth in the Shrimp & Calamari Tom Yum soup. We liked the Fried Whole Thai Mackerel but the Steamed Pompano was a bit bland. Also, it costs extra but be sure to order the House Made Chili Paste. Spicy and all gone at our table!The next time I'm in NYC, Taladwat is a definite stop!",0
17476,"I love hakata-style ramen, and was excited to find Mentoku. They know what they are doing. The bone broth is rich and flavorful, and the noodles are served just right, so they finish cooking in the broth. It's not quite as good as some I've had in California, and I wish they provided all the condiments on the table like fresh garlic and pickled vegetables, but make no mistake. This is still a very good bowl of hakata-style ramen.",0
1644,"**Title: A Triumphant Return to Joe's Pizza**

I recently rekindled my teenage love affair with Joe's Pizza, and honestly, I've been reminded of what true New York pizza is all about. Originally a devotee of the classic Greenwich Village spot off 6th Ave, I found myself questioning my affection over the years. However, a recent visit to their Midtown expansion has reignited my passion—Joe's is back on my radar, and with a vengeance.

Sure, Joe's may not boast the title of ""Best Pizza in NYC,"" but it undeniably trounces 99% of Midtown's offerings. Are they the top dog of Midtown slices? Quite possibly. Do they hold their own in the greater Manhattan pizza landscape? Absolutely—they comfortably claim a spot in the top 20.

Their expansion hasn't diluted quality; it's enhanced it. The new TSQ location is bustling, vibrant, and serving up slices that are as delicious as they are nostalgic. Their success seems destined to grow, just like my appetite whenever I walk through their doors.

Ultimately, Joe's Pizza has earned a raving five-star review from a once skeptical fan. Their slices are a must-try—an essential NYC experience not just for tourists but for anyone who takes their pizza seriously.

So whether you're snapping selfies or grabbing a bite post-night-out, make it a point to stop by Joe's. You won't regret indulging in a slice of this iconic New York establishment.",1
258,"I ordered take out from here and was disappointed with what I received. I ordered the Hokkien mee and the Nyonya seafood fried rice. The Hokkien mee was very liquidy and only had shrimp and some pieces of meat with some vegetables. Typically it should contain other seafood ingredients as well. The seafood fried rice had the option of rice that was made in chicken broth which I opted for. It added a nice, different taste but it was very soft in texture. It also included very few pieces of shrimp, squid and maybe some small sliced scallops but there really wasn't much in it besides rice. However, the prices are pretty good and they do give a lot! Maybe the other options on the menu are better and dining in might be better as well so give it a try.",0

10879,"Title: A Pasta Paradise with Delights Galore

If you think you've heard all there is to say about this gem, think again. This charming eatery excels at crafting pasta that's nothing short of sensational. The tagliatelle and cappelletti are both standouts, offering contrasting experiences that are equally divine. Kick off your meal with the cheese and meat board; the squacquerone cheese alone is worth the visit, transforming the palates of those who taste it. The prosciutto is generous and savory, while the salami has a perfect balance of saltiness and fat.

Wine lovers will revel in the wine flights, especially the well-presented lambrusco variety. The staff shines with their in-depth knowledge, guiding guests through a delightful vinous journey. Don't miss out on the apple crisp cocktail – it's a masterclass in refreshment, striking an ideal balance without an overpowering sweetness.

With portion sizes tailored for individual enjoyment, bring a group of friends to ensure a full exploration of the menu – the pasta lineup is too tempting to not indulge in a variety.",1
1401,"Title: Pre-Event Buzz at Stout: A Go-To Spot Near MSG

Review:

Nestled conveniently close to the hustle of Madison Square Garden and the transit hub of Penn Station, Stout is the quintessential pre-event watering hole. A hub for those gearing up for games, concerts, or simply a spirited happy hour, Stout's appeal is evident in its consistently lively crowd.

As one might expect from its prime location, the place buzzes with energy, particularly in the evenings. Seating can be a rare commodity, and grabbing a bartender's attention might test your patience during peak hours. Fret not, though—the crowd typically thins around 8 PM, ushering in a more relaxed vibe and attentive service.

Beer aficionados will be in their element here, thanks to Stout's impressive selection. The accommodating bartenders are happy to offer samples, allowing you to flirt with various brews before settling down. While you might engage with multiple bartenders throughout the night, this small oddity does little to dampen the overall experience.

Whether you're looking for a pre-event spot or a place to spend the evening, Stout strikes a fine balance between a bustling hotspot and a comfortable retreat. Just remember to arrive with a bit of patience, and you're set for a great night.",1
20081,"Jealous.  Jealous this find on an UWS side street yesterday evening isn't just a little bit closer to my street.  I could just stroll over then, whenever.  Is there an Italian grandmother in the kitchen, because that's what the food tastes like.  Traditional.  Fresh.  Homemade. The appetizer meat balls and eggplant are both baked in a generous serving of luscious tomato sauce that merits the praise. The salad and pizza of the day were also delicious. 12 signature pies or gnocchi on the regular menu.  Limited selection of beer and wine.  It's tiny inside, but it's a cozy tiny and the floor to ceiling glass panels facing 103rd give it a special feel.",0
14009,"My Friday night Mexican food craving led me to try El Toro Mexican Grill via Seamless. This is strictly a delivery review. The fish burrito bowl was a delight, generously filled with tender slices of white fish. However, the grilled chicken enchilada with mole fell short due to tough chicken and a disappointing lack of savory mole sauce, which failed to impress in flavor. Future orders will see us sticking to the fish burrito bowl. Prices and portions are fair, particularly for the downtown location.",1
12050,"Tucked in the Lower East Side, this dollar pizza and Spanish cuisine mashup offers a no-frills takeout experience with a few tables for dining in. The interior is rough around the edges, a clear ode to its budget-friendly menu, with seating to the left and Spanish hot foods to the right. The pizza, served from the back under heat lamps, is disappointingly subpar — a plain slice reminiscent of a dismal cafeteria meal. The sauce is overly sweet and watered down, evoking memories of canned Chef Boyardee, and the crust, although thin, disappointingly turns to mush in the mouth. The cheese, passable at best, does little to redeem the overall quality. The ambiance is marred by a crowd of locals and oddballs who seem more interested in their fellow patrons than the food. Given the lackluster experience, a return visit seems out of the question. A word to the wise: visit at your own risk. Mic drop — there's really nothing more to say. I'm out.",1
3350,"Title: Happy Hour Delights

My recent dining experience was remarkable, thanks to a phenomenal happy hour menu at this city gem. The standout dish was undoubtedly the lobster ravioli, which surprised us with its deliciousness, accompanied by absolutely amazing dipping sauces. The one-dollar oysters were another treat, served with all the classic accompaniments.

For drinks, the house margarita was a solid choice, but the pepper margarita stole the show, and my colleague couldn't get enough of it. Service was exceptional – our wait staff were attentive and friendly, earning themselves a well-deserved hearty tip.

While we booked a reservation for a Saturday night, the atmosphere was relaxed enough to suggest walk-ins might be just fine. I highly recommend this spot for anyone seeking a top-notch and reasonably priced meal in the city.",1
302,"Stopped by this restaurant with high hopes for their much-talked-about ""old-fashioned pizza,"" but left scratching my head. Unfortunately, it missed the mark for a Sicilian's comforting thickness and a Neapolitan's delightful chew, landing in an awkward middle ground with a notably soggy crust. While the toppings were bountiful and decently tasty, they couldn't make up for the dough's shortcomings. In the grand scheme of pizza indulgences, this slice simply isn't worth the calorie splurge.",1
13951,"Title: Mixed Feelings at Yee Li

My recent dining experience at Yee Li was a rollercoaster of highs and lows. The food certainly lived up to expectations – delicious with generous portion sizes, all at a fair price point. Their dumpling noodle soup, a particular favorite of my husband’s, is a dish not to be missed.

However, the service left a bitter taste. Unfortunately, it was reminiscent of less-than-stellar Chinatown service, but somehow managed to further sour the experience. The staff seemed determined to avoid any form of customer interaction, making eye contact a rare luxury. Simple requests for ice, chili sauce, or an extra bowl were either ignored, promptly forgotten, or required multiple reminders – leading to self-service out of sheer necessity.

Our Chinese New Year celebration was especially tarnished when a hefty 18% tip was presumptuously added to our bill, and the waiter had the audacity to question whether I wanted my change back. The feeling of being strong-armed into tipping, on top of the compulsion, is unacceptable.

Despite the culinary delights that Yee Li offers, the lackluster service makes a return visit highly unlikely. A restaurant experience is a symphony of food quality and customer service, and when one falls flat, the entire melody is compromised.",1
12058,"Title: Unremarkable Cart Experience in NYC

During a recent stint as a makeshift chauffeur in New York City, I stumbled upon an inconspicuous lunch cart while waiting for my mother-in-law. With a decent Yelp rating and a growing queue, I snagged a large chicken cheong fun (rice roll) for $3. Though each order was steamed fresh, the sizeable portion couldn't compensate for the lackluster taste. The rice rolls turned out soggy, and the chicken was bland. While the sauce was satisfactory, the overall experience didn’t justify a return visit. It seems wiser to invest an extra dollar elsewhere for both better quality food and a more enjoyable dining setting. This cart, sadly, left me unimpressed.",1
13130,Came a second time to make sure the first time wasn't a fluke. Still loved the tie-dye pizza and we split a large 2 ways. Pizza is still thin and crispy all the way through. Walked in at 5pm on a weekday and sat immediately.,0

19129,"Title: Warm Ambiance and Stellar Starters

I recently dined at a charming restaurant where the overall experience was delightful. The service was nothing short of impeccable, attentive without being overbearing. The drinks were mixed to perfection, and the appetizers set a high bar, with the crostini being a particular highlight – each bite was a burst of flavor. Desserts didn't disappoint either; they were phenomenal, ending the meal on a high note.

However, the main course – a $33 black ink paella – left a bit to be desired in both quantity and flavor balance. While the presentation was appealing, the paella featured just one large shrimp and a few clams, overshadowed by a generous portion of rice, which was slightly on the saltier side for my taste.

Despite the main course not quite hitting the mark, the restaurant provided a cozy refuge on a cold evening before seeing the Rockettes. The quality of the starters and desserts, coupled with the excellent service, prompts me to return and sample another main dish.",1
12469,"Visiting New York Dec 2019 and it's snowing  now it feels like Christmas!  We were starving after a 5 hr flight with some delay. We were told by a friend to Bareburger and why not since there is a location on our street we are staying.  We checked in about 8pm and were quickly seated by the hostess. It was about 3/4 full on Monday evening. The menu looks great with do many different burgers and also nice to see a vegan menu  on the 2nd page! We ordered:- coconut milkshake cookies & cream: my husband had to help me describe this as I am still sick and can't taste  but he said it had a strong coconut taste and really delicious! -So Cal burger: my burger is organic turkey with avocado, mayo, onions, alfalfa, cheese and sprout bun. It was really good considering I couldn't really taste. My husband took a few bites and he it tasted healthy. The Duke: bison, cheddar cheese, onions, mushroom, kale, tomatoes, aioli with an egg. That is a juicy and messy burger. Watching my husband eat infront of me, man not a good sight but as long as he likes it, I'm happy. He did say the bison could have more salt and add acid to the burger. He added ketchup from the table which elevated the flavour. - Moscow mule: hubby liked it. Especially at $3 special baby for Monday's. All in all, great food, fantastic table service. Would definitely come back when I can taste again.",0

Been eating here for years (only about 3 or 4 times total though lol) so I'm glad that it's still around as a NYC late-night staple.A couple of Saturdays ago, my friend was the first to arrive just before opening and RIGHT before crowds followed. She was first on line and was able to wait downstairs. Everyone else had to form a line outside on the street - unfortunate! Our full party of 3 was able to make it before 5pm so we were literally the first to get seated. Amazing.We ordered:- 3 frozen beers ($7/each)- Kalbi / Grilled Short Ribs ($14.95)- Omu Soba ($12.95)- Super Mew / Sushi Platter ($23.95)The frozen beers are super unique to this restaurant/izakaya - one of their specialties, I believe. They're pretty fun to try, even if you're not a huge beer person. The kalbi was super tender and marinated perfectly, drool. Loved that it came with some salad/veggies on the side. It also complemented our order of omu soba, one of my all-time favorite dishes here - such a classic. The Super Mew was perfect for sharing between 3 people, since it came with 3 pieces of Tuna, Salmon & Yellowtail each as well as a Spicy Tuna Roll.

The menu offerings were plentiful; my table was adorned with an array of dim sum, a succulent duck, hearty noodles, and fresh vegetables. While the meal was fulfilling, it fell short of remarkable—the shrimp dumplings, for instance, had an oddly rough texture that detracted from the experience. Moreover, the steep final bill of $90 for two seemed disproportionate to the quality of the fare, suggesting that better value could likely be found elsewhere.",1

15203,"Title: Convenient Takeout with Authentic Flavors

I've visited this eatery a handful of times considering its proximity to my workplace. It's become my go-to spot for authentic, home-cooked Indian food. The value is impressive; for just $10.99, you can indulge in a generous serving of chicken curry, complete with basmati rice, naan bread, and a side salad—sufficient for two to share. Taste-wise, it deserves a solid 4 out of 5.

However, when it comes to atmosphere and decor, it falls short with a score of 2. It's not my first choice for dining in unless convenience trumps ambience. The extensive menu promises a variety of delectable choices, reinforcing my recommendation for their takeout based on the excellent food and value. In summary, when it comes to this spot, ""make mine to go"" is my mantra!",1

Last evening, my friend and I decided to dine at this cozy little spot that turned out to be a culinary revelation. Right from the onset, the staff - including waiters and bartenders - created a welcoming vibe with their pleasant demeanor, contributing to the overall charming atmosphere of the place.

But let's talk about the main event - the food. I'm still in awe! My friend opted for the vegetarian Beyond Burger and was absolutely floored by its authenticity; she swore it was indistinguishable from a beef burger. Vegetarians, take note: this is a must-try. I, on the other hand, indulged in the American burger and I'm not exaggerating when I say it's the best I've ever had. It was a triumph of flavors, especially satisfying after a long day without food.

The sides kept up the standard, with fries that were nothing short of perfection, and let's not forget the drinks - each sip as delightful as the last. My friend was so impressed that she's already made a repeat visit, and I'm eagerly looking forward to my next meal here. If you haven't yet, do yourself a favor and experience this place for yourself.",1
2403,"Title: A Letdown on Mexican Independence Day

As a Mexican eager to share my culture with friends on Mexican Independence day, I was drawn to a restaurant promising happy hour specials and discounted small plates. Excited for what I anticipated to be a memorable evening, I made reservations.

Upon arrival, we were seated on the second floor, but our excitement quickly waned when we learned the happy hour deals were exclusive to the bar downstairs—a detail frustratingly omitted from the flyer and our host. We were relegated to the standard menu with its steeper prices.

The meal itself was underwhelming. I ordered queso fundido and taquitos al pastor, only to be met with cold tortillas and staggered serving times that disjointed the dining experience for my group. The service further dampened the evening, plagued by sluggishness and an overzealous server pushing guacamole with uncomfortable persistence.

I regret to say that this restaurant failed to live up to the hype and did little to honor the spirit of the holiday. My advice: look elsewhere to satisfy your craving for Mexican cuisine and hospitality.",1
13889,"Solid spot for lunch. Chipotle but better because free guacamole in the burrito bowls. Also, they have more protein options (including fish), and the salad base is actually mixed greens and not just plain old lettuce. Prices are pretty fair too for the area. My bowl cost me ~$10.",0

In a modest looking sized place, the combination of choices they offer is pretty amazing where you get to pick your protein, sauce and even the style of preparation.I was here once for lunch and was not surprised by the length of the waiting line. In most of the places this has been a critical factor for me to set the expectations straight away and this place was no exception. The choices of food looked pretty different from most of the other Mediterranean restaurants. Ask them for a spicy meal and they will provide you with small boxes of minced chillies that went well with the meal. Also, the add on peta bread they provided was very soft and pretty good.They are a little bit on the pricey side but the quantity of food would be way more than sufficient for one person.",0

13135,I think another reviewer described this place perfectly. It's a great deal when your looking for good sushi but don't have to pay omakase prices. My husband and I each got the dream box which was so much fun. The pictures make the bowls look big when in fact they're pretty small but it's so fun to try each bowl and the sushi was fresh. We also got the 10 price pick you own sushi which was also great. It's a good option to try since you can pick fish that's not included in the dream box. We also got the unagi as an appetizer. It was a bit too saucy for me and hard but still good.,0
12068,"Title: Fresh Flavors Shine at the Bowl Spot

My experience at this restaurant was largely a savory delight, with their bowls excellently showcasing the fresh taste and texture of the fish. The Sichuan Chili Salmon bowl I chose was a symphony of perfectly balanced flavors, avoiding the pitfall of becoming a random mix of ingredients. Each element, from the tingling spiciness of the salmon to the sharpness of the pickled radish, worked in harmony. The generous sprinkling of furikake seasoning was a thoughtful touch, ensuring that the rice remained appealing to the last grain.

However, I couldn't help but wish for a more generous ingredient portion in relation to the price, particularly with the medium-sized bowl. Stepping up to the large option did strain the wallet a bit, and it would justify its cost more with the addition of one or two more complementary elements, such as avocado or some crunchy texture.

A minor gripe was with the bowl material, which unfortunately let a good amount of rice go to waste due to sticking. This seems like an easy fix that would enhance the overall experience.

On the plus side, the restaurant's interior was spacious and welcoming, a pleasant surprise compared to the usually cramped spaces in Manhattan. With plenty of seating available post-lunch rush, it made for a comfortable and relaxed dining atmosphere.",1
19881,"Title: Cozy Brunch with a Sweet Twist

My recent brunch experience at this charming eatery was a delight, beginning with a well-appointed table in their quaint enclosed porch. The atmosphere here strikes a nice balance, with a spacious main dining area complemented by an inviting bar.

Despite the Sunday rush, the availability of tables was a pleasant surprise, suggesting reservations may not be essential—though highly recommended if you're eyeing the coveted porch seating.

The menu’s variety was impressive, covering everything from classic egg dishes to inventive bowls, flapjacks, French toasts, and lunch staples like sandwiches and burgers. The service shone brightly, marked by a staff that was both knowledgeable and attentive, making the meal all the more enjoyable.

My husband and I indulged in our separate entrees, but the true highlight was the shared caramelized banana French toast. A must-try, this dish stole the show as a sumptuous dessert-end to our brunch.

The bloody mary I tried was satisfactory, yet it lacked a certain zest and the traditional garnish of a celery stick. That said, the overall value was commendable, with portions justifying the prices quite well.

In summary, this spot is a worthy contender for your brunch rotation, especially if you have a sweet tooth to satiate!",1

1615,"Title: Disappointing Takeout Experience

I recently ordered from a local restaurant via GrubHub, and while the delivery issues—arriving late and cold—might not be entirely on them, the food quality certainly was. The highlight was the Roti Canai appetizer, which was quite enjoyable, and the pork dumplings showed potential, although they required some at-home pan-frying due to their small, shumai-like size.

Unfortunately, the main courses fell flat. My girlfriend noted that the flat noodle dish perpetually lacks egg, an essential component, and I found the red curry disappointingly thin and bereft of the vibrant flavors I usually associate with Thai cuisine. Overall, the experience left much to be desired, and I'm inclined to dine elsewhere in the future.",1
14859,"Typical American restaurant vibe, the burgers while really delicious were super basic, no toppings outside a thin cut pickle and the sides were a pile of lettuce (with no dressing) and about 7 chips. While I understand the aim for quality and presentation, $25 for a burger with essentially nothing to it is really overkill. Drinks were mediocre at best for $16. Wait staff was nice and attentive so no issues there. While I have no complaints about the food, it just wasn't nearly worth the price, plenty of better options in the area.",0
10575,"Solid sushi/Japanese.  I tried the pan fried udon with chicken and enjoyed it - the chicken had a sort of glaze that made it much more tasty than the traditional chicken in udon.  Also had the vegetable roll (avocado, cucumber, mushrooms, something pickled) and it was decent.  My sushi has the sushi and it looked amazing.  Only thing I didn't like was the egg roll which didn't have much filling at all, and was like am empty fried shell.  The deliver was much faster than advertised on trycaviar.  I would definitely order again.",0
13174,"I ordered delivery from here for lunch and I thought it was just ok. I ordered the 3 roll lunch special and each roll tasted average. I think it was mainly because of the rice that lacked any flavor. I got a spicy tuna roll, salmon and avocado roll and shrimp tempura roll. Also, my order came an hour late, which is pretty ridiculous. I don't think I would order from here again.",0
13791,"Title: Authentic Hot Pot Delight at Dalongyi

I recently dined at Dalongyi, a hot pot restaurant with a solid reputation straight from China, and my experience was nothing short of authentic. Visiting on a Sunday night with a friend, we were seated immediately—though I'd recommend securing reservations or joining the Yelp waitlist to ensure your spot.

We opted for the three-way pot, featuring medium spicy, mushroom, and tomato broths. While all were enjoyable, the medium spicy broth was the standout—packed with red peppers and peppercorns, it delivered on heat and flavor. Although it was significantly spicy, I found myself curious about the even hotter version and might opt for 'very spicy' next time.

The a la carte selection - meats, veggies, carbs - was impressive in both quality and quantity. I was particularly fond of the wide clear noodles and hand-pulled noodles, which were delightful. An added convenience was having sauces and seasonings readily available at the table. While there were fewer ingredients for sauce customization than I'm accustomed to, the resulting sauce was still delicious.

In summary, Dalongyi offers an authentic hot pot experience with fantastic broths, high-quality ingredients, and the convenience of tableside condiments. It's a must-try for anyone in search of an authentic hot pot meal.",1
12640,I loved the ramen here! I had the tonketsu ramen and I added an egg to mine. It was extremely flavorful and filling. The price I felt like was a little bit more on the pricier side but I felt like it was worth to at least try once or twice. I went on a really cold day so the ramen really hit the spot! There was a long line but the hostess didn't waste any time in seating everyone and making sure everyone filled out a menu in line to save time. I did go around dinner time so that could've explained the long line. Overall I would definitely come back again to try another type of ramen on their menu.,0
1835,"Title: A Pleasant Tea Time at Bluebirds in NYC

As an aficionado of tea time experiences, my latest foray at Bluebirds in the Columbus Circle mall was a tradition worth upholding. Nestled on the third floor, the modern ambiance paired with a charming view of the bustling area provided a serene backdrop. Despite the crowd, the service shined, thanks largely to our patient and attentive waiter who navigated the busyness with grace.

We opted for the tea service, a modest selection of 10-12 varieties. The English breakfast tea was satisfactory, a decent representation of the classic brew, though it lacked a distinctive edge. The accompanying fare was neatly presented on a round tiered tower — a spread of good, if not particularly standout, offerings. The egg salad sandwich was a personal highlight, while the chicken salad sandwich fell a bit short. The cucumber and salmon varieties were enjoyable, and although the scones were unremarkable, the mystery fruit scone added a touch of intrigue. The dessert section was delightful, especially the chocolate cake bite that concluded the meal on a high note.

Priced at $50 per person, Bluebirds' tea time aligns with New York City's standard for such an indulgence. Overall, I left satisfied and curious about their extended menu for future visits.",1
10059,"This isn't the place you go for the atmosphere or the decor. You go for the amazing soup noodles, hand pulled may I add. The dumplings with the addition of extra chili oil make a great side too. The umami flavor of the broth was like nothing I've ever tasted, don't forget the abundance of noodles to go along with it. I'll definitely be back to this place!",0
1494,Wow! It's been ages since I could order Pad See Ew! Made just right at NaNa Thai Street in the Flatiron district. I added shrimp but I don't remember if all the proteins were safe. They use gluten free soy sauce as their standard. The entire menu marks what is gluten free and also vegan. It's a small place so it's ideal for 1 or 2 people at a table. Hit the spot before catching a movie at the AMC 2.5 blocks away.,0
2470,"I celebrated my 30th birthday at this fantastic restaurant, and I must say, it was an unforgettable experience. The culinary highlight had to be the succulent tomahawk steaks which were cooked to perfection. Accompanying sides like the creamy mac 'n' cheese and crisp asparagus complemented the meal beautifully. The appetizers were just as delectable and set a high bar for the rest of the dinner.

Despite being a party of four adults and a child, the service was impeccable, never missing a beat. Coming to the value aspect, we found the price to be quite reasonable for the high-quality fare and service, with the total bill rounding off to roughly $500.

This place nailed it on all fronts and made sure my milestone birthday was celebrated with great food and joy. I would wholeheartedly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking to make their special occasions extra memorable.",1
11895,"3.5/5, rounded down because of the not-great value. Food ranged from so-so to pretty tasty, but wouldn't necessarily recommend or return.We ordered several tapas to share, including three pintxos (foie gras terrine, sofrito topped with quail egg, and deviled crab), octopus carpaccio, the ham and shrimp ""gnocchi"", and the seared beef cheek. The three orders of pintxos (small slice of bread topped with various items) only came with two bites each, so if you're dining out with a larger group, the cost of these add up quite quickly (each ranged from $8-10). My favorite of the three was the foie gras terrine (although it's hard to mess up foie). The seared beef cheek was also very tasty and tender - this one actually came as a generous portion size. My least favorite dish of the night was the octopus carpaccio. The octopus was sliced so thinly, that it barely had any texture or existence in one's mouth, and they overdid it on the olive oil.We also got one of the cakes to share for dessert, but it tasted like something that had been sitting in a fridge for a while.",0
20737,"During Restaurant Week, I had the opportunity to dine at this establishment and the value for money was impressive! Although I generally would hesitate at the usual $70 price tag, the all-you-can-eat experience during this special week was unparalleled. The array of meats was endless, with at least ten different cuts effortlessly landing on my plate in quick succession, too rapid to even identify.

The buffet selection was equally commendable, comprising a variety of sushi rolls, sumptuous scalloped potatoes, fresh shrimp, and diverse salad options - truly something for every palate. However, be wary of the wine prices - a house Chianti set us back $15, which seems to be the restaurant's subtle way of balancing the Restaurant Week deals.

Despite the wine cost surprise, the overall experience was enjoyable. The staff was exceedingly hospitable, and the quality of the food was commendable. A worthwhile visit, especially during promotional events.",1
2675,"I had high hopes for this restaurant, but it turned out to be the WORST dining experience I've ever encountered. Seating was prompt despite a busy lunch hour, yet service was abysmal—I endured a 15-minute wait before a waitress absentmindedly acknowledged me, only to wander off without taking my order.

When I finally managed to place my order—two skewers (lamb and pork) and Greek orzo—the food was just passable. The lamb skewer, though tasty, was not worth its steep $8.50 price tag in comparison to other eateries. The Greek orzo was disappointingly bland, lacking any sauce or vegetables.

The ordeal continued with the payment process. First, I was presented with someone else's check. Then, after rectifying that error, I was shocked to find my card charged $65.33 instead of the correct amount of $22.86. No apology was offered for this mistake, just confusion from the staff.

Overall, the experience was frustrating from start to finish. I recommend seeking out one of the many superior Greek dining options available in Astoria, NYC. This establishment will certainly not see my return.",1
13333,"3.5 stars but I'm rounding down. Whomp. I forgot who exactly recommended EN Japanese Brasserie to me but the gist of their recommendation was ""come here if you really want to treat yourself to Japanese food."" And, to put positives first, I will say that the dining space is insanely beautiful and sleek, with actual room to sit and talk. This kind of dining real estate is practically unheard of in Manhattan, where the worst was when I lifted a forkful of food to my mouth and a crumb bounced off the edge of my plate and onto my neighbor's (Buvette in the West Village, I still cringe at the memory). And the food we ordered was delicious as well. I haven't had homemade tofu in a long time and I'm always reminded of how much better it tastes than the store-bought, vacuum-sealed version where it's been sitting in a tub of its own water. The little side dishes of mushrooms and pickles were good as well, though. But, add to the fact that our food came out almost eerily quickly after we placed our order and everything was ice-cold in temperature, I was a little thrown off at how it seemed to have come straight out of the fridge. The service was also really off, despite the restaurant being 20% full on a weekend afternoon. For the most part, our waitress seemed to actively avoid our table. We just couldn't find her - not to take our order and not to get our check. I had to keep flagging down the busboys. Another thing: we gave our waitress two credit cards to split the bill. She took it (I guess not really noticing there were two cards) and then dropped my friend's card on the floor by accident and just walked off. Had my friend not gotten up and noticed her card on the flood and actually followed her to the register, she would have just swiped my card for the whole bill without realizing she had dropped a customer's card on the floor. As with most things in life, it's all in the details, and for a place to pay such attention to the decor and ambiance, it was weird and off-putting where the actual customer interaction lacked much awareness at all. I'm not saying all places should have Nakazawa-level of detail (where I swear the servers have ESP) but it's definitely not good where the only thing I'll really remember about EN is that the waitress dropped the credit card.",0
17509,"I had an unbelievable dining experience at this gem of a Peruvian restaurant. The atmosphere is vibrant, perfectly complementing the authenticity of their truly delicious dishes. The ceviche was exceptional, boasting freshness and flavor that transported me straight to Peru. Our server, Claudia, was the epitome of sweetness and attentiveness. She made our meal not just a dining experience but a joyous event with her helpfulness. Impeccable cleanliness paired with some of the best service I've encountered in recent memory made my visit memorable. I urge you not to miss out on this marvelous culinary destination.",1
1207,"This is now my favorite ramen restaurant in town! At first we decided to stop in for their sake deal, where the glasses were half price and came with a free shot glass to keep. In the end, we stayed much longer, ordering ramen and karaage, which were both very delicious. Best of all, however, was the wonderful service! Our waitress was great and so friendly. At the end of the night, the owner, Tomo, actually came to our table and drank a shot with us, which will be a memory I cherish from this wonderful restaurant.",0
10967,"I recently visited a local restaurant with my colleagues after work and was pleasantly surprised by the culinary delights that greeted us.

19352,"Title: A Futuristic Culinary Gem Worth Booking

As a word to the wise, secure a reservation at this culinary hotspot to avoid disappointment; it's a popular destination for good reason. On our fortuitous visit, we snagged seats at the bar and indulged in the well-priced $46 three-course meal that did not disappoint.

Stepping inside, I was struck by its unique ambiance, reminiscent of Atomix's futuristic minimalism. Think of a chic, modernist space with an industrial flair, complete with concrete accents and staff dressed in stylish, severe tunics straight out of a Kanye West fashion line. But let's talk about what really matters: the food.

The yellowtail was a delight, its temperature perfect to bring out the silky fat on the palate. The chrysanthemum dish, enhanced with the unexpected addition of cheddar, was a flavorful surprise. The earthy tones of the sunchoke course were brought to life by the addition of oyster mushrooms and black truffle, creating a memorable taste sensation akin to 'eating the earth' in the most delicious sense.

A softly steamed egg custard topped with fresh uni was a standout, demonstrating the kitchen's finesse. The mackerel, often maligned for its oiliness, was a revelation here, served steamed and devoid of any fishy aftertaste. Finally, the octopus was a textural triumph with its crunchy and crisp edges.

In short, every dish was a testament to the kitchen's prowess. I left already planning my next visit to delve deeper into their menu. A must-visit for any aficionado of fine dining.",1
18331,The Ramen Shack in Cafe Zaiya/Tomiz is the perfect complement. I had been to Cafe Zaiya before and felt that the back space was a bit empty and now it's filled with lots of people slurping up their ramen noodles. You order at the register and then they'll bring out the bowls of ramen from the kitchen to your table.I decided to give the Quiet Storm a try. Mmm it's a really rich ramen soup! Noodles were perfectly cooked. I appreciate the addition of spinach. Makes me feel like I'm adding to my daily vegetable requirement.,0
2571,"Title: A Feast for the Eyes and Palate

If there's an African restaurant that knows how to blend exquisite taste with visual appeal, this gem is it. Ditching the norm where presentation often takes a backseat, they elevate each dish to a work of art. The Dibi lamb was succulent, and the Icheke—seasoned to perfection in-house, sparing diners the usual DIY seasoning with a Maggie cube—left me speechless. It's the kind of place you'd want to indulge in daily, if not for the waistline concerns! Yes, the space is compact, but don't let that deter you. It's an absolute must-visit for anyone craving authentic, beautifully crafted African cuisine.",1
20749,"Prince Street has long been hailed as one of New York's best slice pizza shops, and I finally made it here when two friends visited from out of town. We came here in a group on a Tuesday evening around 7:30. There was a small line of people, but we didn't wait very long to order, or get our pizzas. There is only standing room to eat, but lots of areas with seating outside on the streets that you can take the pizza to eat. I tried both the spicy pepperoni (their signature), and the margherita. Both were good, and I didn't have any preference over the other. The pepperoni slice was thick, in Detroit style, while the margherita slice was like a regular pizza. Overall, I thought the pizza was good, but not sure if I would be able to call it New York's best.",0
11331,"What a busy brunch place.  Our wait was about twenty minutes,  huddling by the doorway because this is February. Their Matzo Ball soup looked so inviting,  so I got that with a side of bacon-long meaty strips that was saltier than I would like. I passed those to my husband and tried his fried chicken.  That was very good. The fried chickens were flavorful and the pancakes were thick and huge and delicious! Actually, they taste very similar to my daughter's pancakes. Valrhona Hot chocolate was outstanding! Rich, but not sickeningly so. Then,  I went back to more bites of fried chickens; its tasty crunch was a complement to my soup. Service was efficient here, too. Ambiance is casual, but cool. My kids cleaned their plates off, and enjoyed the rap music in the background.",0
2890,"Title: Tasty Pizza, But Service Falls Short

I recently dined at a local pizzeria that's perfect for pizza aficionados. With an extensive selection of pies, the flexibility to customize toppings to split with friends was a big plus. The food truly hit the mark – delicious to the last bite, and the prices won't break the bank.

However, it's not all five stars here. The service dampened the experience, as our waitress came across as quite rude. She failed to check in on us and her lack of friendliness felt off-putting.

In summary, this restaurant serves up some great pizza at a fair price. It's a fantastic spot for a casual meal, though I'm holding out hope that future visits feature improved service to match the quality of the food.",1
14047,"Nice burger . Gotta say, probably one of the best burgers I've had in a while. Every component of the burger was enjoyable and juicy. A little messy, but that's what burgers should be like. The fries were not half bad as well. I also had the french onion soup, which was delicious.My only complaint is the price. It was around $20 for the burger and fries and around $8 or $9 for the soup. Not a place to come for a quickie. Come with a group of friends, and you'll have a great time feasting on some delish dishes with great service.",0

19950,"I visited a bustling restaurant on a Thursday afternoon; by 12:53 PM, the place was packed with about 25 people eagerly waiting for their meals. I joined a shorter queue of 12 near the back, with the choice to order via a kiosk or from a live cashier. Opting for the latter at 1:04 PM, I was impressed by the cashier's efficiency amidst the chaos. My order—a medley of caramel pork, lemongrass chicken, and beef bulgogi—arrived in a reasonable 15 minutes.

Each dish was a burst of flavor, especially the beef and pork for those with a sweet tooth. The lemongrass chicken was the standout for me, perfectly balancing zest and seasoning. While the spring roll bites left me wanting more, the drinks menu was a pleasant surprise. The coffee, Thai tea, and lemon Thai tea had a subtler sweetness than usual, much to my liking.

Despite the initial wait, the food quality and service have me excited to return, particularly to try the order-ahead option. A gem for flavorful, well-crafted dishes.",1
2585,"I love David Cheng and was told to come here and sit at the bar. We decided just to do a few appetizers/small plates before going to our next stop for the evening. We got the fried chicken, the pickle sandwich, the sourdough crepe, and the hamburger (add foie gras). Everything was delicious. We all agreed that the pickle sandwich was our favorite. It seems weird, but it really works. The fried chicken was a very close second for me. It was served cold and I loved it. The sourdough crepe was so unique. The prices were very reasonable and the bar is a great way to try the restaurant at a lower price point. I love that the prices include tip. Our service was outstanding. We would definitely recommend it!",0
20415,"Title: Indulgent Delight at The Plaza Food Hall

If there's one place I can't resist during my New York visits, it's the Plaza Food Hall. A recent stop - yes, a decade later - introduced me to their latest culinary delights. Enter the lobster roll with Petrossian caviar, a concept so quintessentially NY; I had to indulge.

Fresh off the flight from Denver and reunited with long-missed friends, excitement levels were sky-high. The $45 price tag made it the priciest lobster roll I've had, yet the presentation promised something special. Despite the crowd, service was swift, and I eagerly joined my friends for the unveiling.

It's not every day you get to spoon caviar onto your food, but it's an experience I dove into headfirst. The caviar, to my surprise, was an excellent companion to the lobster - elevating the dish to new heights without making me feel out of my depth.

While the temptation to splurge at the adjacent caviar outlet was strong, my budget breathed a sigh of relief as I exercised restraint. This meal was not only a unique adventure but also a delicious one. If you're looking for an upscale twist on a classic, the caviar-topped lobster roll at the Plaza Food Hall is a must-try. And, according to my friends, there's plenty more to savor for those with different tastes.",1
11860,"Visited this gem during my recent trip to NYC and was thoroughly impressed. From the outset, the service was top-notch. A friendly chef caught our attention, accommodating our specific fish preferences by tailor-making our omakase experience. Each piece of sushi, especially the scallop, boasted of freshness with its natural sweetness shining through. The torched otoro deserves a special mention – a sheer delight! With the delicious food, lovely atmosphere, and very reasonable pricing, this restaurant is a must-visit. The warmth of the staff adds a special touch to the dining experience. Counting down the days until I can return!",1

I asked our waiter if they had Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo Pasta (something I've been craving) and he said ""you got it."" Pasta was so flavorful and the presentation was remarkable. Generous portions and fair prices. Overall, very nice ambiance, great service, and delicious food. If you want to dine at a place that serves top quality food with even better service, I would recommend Il Punto!",0

They serve a variety of Szechuan food, and the food quality overall was just mediocre.We had the dan dan noodles, fried dry pepper chicken and mapo tofu with minced pork. I would definitely pass on the mapo tofu as it's not nearly as good as it looks. There wasn't much flavor to it outside of the numbing chili taste.The dan dan noodles were okay, they hit the spot for dan dan noodles but aren't really all that special. The Fried Dry Pepper Chicken was also pretty average, kind of hitting the spot in some areas, such as having decent seasoning, but sorely lacking in others, having being less crunchy than ideal.",0
14433,"Title: Cozy Italian Charm with Mixed Feelings

My dining companion and I recently visited an Italian restaurant on our quest for good cuisine. The interior charmed us instantly with its rustic decor, twinkle lights, and a cozy ambiance accentuated by candlelight and wood accents. The extensive menu promised a wide array of Italian classics, though a notable absence of dish descriptions next to their Italian names made ordering slightly challenging.

After some assistance from our accommodating waiter, I chose the Chicken Rollatini. It arrived with an unexpected twist—linguine in marsala sauce instead of the requested penne with pesto. While this was a mix-up, the quality of the dish convinced me to overlook the error. The chicken, oozing with cheese and wrapped in savory prosciutto, was divine, albeit the marsala sauce lacked the depth and traditional flavors I anticipated.

The complimentary bread was unremarkable, lacking warmth and flavor—a minor letdown in an otherwise inviting setting. Service was friendly but inattentive to detail, leading to a less than perfect culinary experience.

Portions were generous and pricing reasonable, providing a decent value for the area. Despite the pleasant environment and some tasty offerings, the missteps in service and cuisine leave me uncertain about a return visit.",1
18298,"Ordered delivery from here tonight. The tokoyaki and chicken ramen.Tokoyaki was $10. It came with 8 pieces of the fried octopus balls. Soooo worth it. They were hot and delicious! Soft. The octopus was cooked perfect. No chewiness! The sauce was thick and yummy! The topping was crunchy and added a nice touch. I totally recommend trying these!!!The Chicken Ramen was $16. Included noodles, bamboo shoots, a little chicken, and green onions. The broth came separate which made the noodles stick together in a solid clump. No egg :( the broth was good. The chicken was cooked perfect. I just wish there was more of it! I've definitely had better ramen.I would definitely order the tokoyaki again!!!",0
1762,"Came here as a party of six and I really liked how this place still has a three-course meal for lunch during restaurant week. The atmosphere is lovely and quiet, and I really liked the decor of our table.Lunch Ratings:1st course :: Mussels Picantino :: I liked it. The mussels were pretty good and the soup is flavorful. They also give you a small mussel fork to get the meat off the shell and a spoon for the soup. I thought the 1st course was supposed to be an appetizer but this one is like an entree.2nd course :: Lobster Ravioli :: I liked this dish. It's nice and creamy and you can literally taste the real lobsters.3rd course :: Tiramisu :: This was the worst tiramisu I ever had and I didn't even finish it. It was dry and it didn't taste like real tiramisu... more like some sort of mediocre cake.3rd course :: Cheesecake :: Looked good in the picture but it didnn't taste like cheesecake because it tasted like they used ricotta cheese to make this. So thumbs down on this one as well.The service was polite and friendly but slow. We literally waited more than 10 minutes between each course.20% gratuity included in the bill regardless the party size.Minus 1 star for slow service and mediocre desserts.",0
11218,"On a bustling Saturday evening at Chelsea Market, my friends and I found ourselves drawn to a tempting taco spot where the queue, about 30 strong at 4:30 PM, surprisingly advanced swiftly within 5-10 minutes. The service system was commendably efficient - order, pay, ticket, and in mere moments, freshly prepared tacos at your disposal.

I ambitiously sampled the shaved pork, cactus, and the especial with steak - the latter, a delightful hybrid of empanada and taco, stole the show with its cheesy richness, amplified by the addition of meat. While the shaved pork with a zest of pineapple was satisfying, the cactus taco was less remarkable, akin to eggplant.

Three varieties of salsa were available to customize the tacos, which I'd advise taking to-go given the challenge of finding a seat in the crowded market.

The attached photos detail the pricing, but the quality and experience far outweigh the cost. Don't let the line deter you - these tacos are worth the wait.",1
2909,"Title: A Touristy Gem in Manhattan Exceeds Expectations

During my recent travels to Manhattan, I decided to embrace the tourist experience at a popular dining spot, and I'm delighted to report that it was a decision well made. Initially, I anticipated a classic trade-off: spectacular views for subpar cuisine at inflated prices. To my pleasant surprise, the restaurant defied my expectations with its culinary offerings.

Despite the steep prices, which were anticipated, the quality of the food was a standout. The multi-course meal commenced with a selection of terrific starters that set a high bar for what was to come. The main course featured a steak dinner that truly impressed with its preparation and flavor – a rarity in venues where the scenery usually takes center stage. The desserts rounded off the dining experience on a high note, with their delightful taste matching the excellence of the preceding dishes.

As expected, the views were indeed spectacular, providing a wonderful backdrop to the meal. The service was reasonably attentive, striking a good balance without being overbearing. All in all, this restaurant offers more than just a meal; it provides a joyous tourist outing with the bonus of a culinary experience that can hold its own. Highly recommended for tourists seeking an enjoyable evening in Manhattan with the added perk of a delicious feast.",1
2441,"Title: A Delightful Uptown Lunch Experience at a Friendly Price

I recently dined at an unassuming gem uptown, where the lunch special stole the show. For a mere $11.95, the deal included a heartwarming soup, a perfectly cooked penne a la vodka, and a glass of wine—an absolute steal. Bartender Shanissa, brimming with friendliness and wit, along with a notable regular, Ed, added a personal touch to the ambiance. As I lingered, Happy Hour beckoned, offering a well-mixed $5 margarita that was irresistible.

Seated at the bar, I was enveloped in a vibrant blend of Spanish and hip-hop tunes, perfect for a casual hangout or a lively pregame. The congenial vibe was contagious, and it's clear this spot holds the recipe for happy hour allure. Without a doubt, whenever I find myself uptown again, a return visit is in order.",1
19602,"TLDR: First US location of a steamed rice roll chain. Worth trying if you're in the area but would not wait beyond 15 minutes for this. Possibly one of the better HK milk teas to be in New York.I found myself with about an hour to kill on a Sunday and figured I'd try this rice roll spot everyone's talking about. The line was about 30 deep when I got there but figured it might not be so bad, I was a table of 1. Got seated in around 20 minutes.It's not super costly but I also wouldn't call it cheap either. It's around $7 for a rice roll dish. I got the shrimp one to stay, chicken/chive to go and roast pork with beef to go. Also ordered HK milk teaWow. The HK milk tea here was good man. It was creamy but the underlying tea flavor was strong, it punched through even all of that condensed milk. Very very good, probably one of the best ones I've had in NY.Servers messed up my order and the table next to mine a couple of times. Eventually it came right though.The rice rolls were enjoyable but honestly I found the flavor to be very subtle. They give you a spoon to cut through it and while eating, the texture I'd say is more on the slippery side. I can't quite pinpoint it but it wasn't as silky as I was looking for. If I were to summarize the rice noodles, it was an elevated version of what I'd order at dim sum but with more exotic ingredients.The ones I took to go were terrible. Then again, rice noodles don't travel well. If you're in the area, check it out and while it'll be decent - it won't blow you away. It's a place I'd go to for a snack, definitely not a destination for lunch or dinner.",0

16364,"I have mix feeling about this place. The service was a bit odd. I came in with Pulsd coupon, and made a reservation an hour ahead of time which was seamless. But when I got there they had no clue that I requested a outdoor seating and I had to ask for onsite. The waiter came and I told them about using pulsed order they didn't know what to do, another one came and took my phone, walked around with my phone asking multiple people, after 5 mins he came back asked me to unlock my phone and scan the code in front of me. I wish they are more trained for what they have offer. The place has very large outdoor seating. The food was great and really generous portion. Ordered octopus carpaccio as starter to share, very thin sliced topped greens and cherry tomato. Starter is pretty big so very good for two person. Ordered lobster Tagliolini, which is very creamy and flavorful, with big chunks of lobsters on top. Also ordered Branzino - Butterfly open Sea Bass, there's an entire fish, very big portion. Most places only has a piece but here they give you a full fish, it comes with spinach and mash potato. For dessert we shared a salted caramel cake. It's a little bit too sweat to my taste but still very delicious. The coupon comes with a bottle of wine, the rose was not on the list but they offered a nice bottle to us.Apart from using coupon got a bit hiccup, overall the service was a little bit slow but good. The price is high but great quality and big portion.",0

17522,"Title: A Lukewarm Experience at Mentoku Ramen

On a bustling Sunday afternoon, my companion and I ventured into the compact and casually adorned premises of Mentoku, lured by its mention on a Thrillist list touting the best ramen in NYC. To our surprise, we were greeted with available seating options, a scarce sight in the busy Hell’s Kitchen area.

We commenced our meal with gyoza and takoyaki, both reasonably priced at $4. The gyoza triumphed with its well-executed flavors, yet the takoyaki fell flat, relying heavily on its sauce for a flavor boost. Our anticipation for the main event, the ramen, met with a taste of mediocrity. The ajitama ramen I ordered boasted a tonkotsu base that lacked distinctiveness and was overshadowed by noodles bearing an untraditional consistency, reminiscent of soba, rather than the silkiness I yearned for. My friend’s adventurous choice, the spicy whip cream ramen, presented an unusual sweet twist with a fruit and pepper infusion—an acquired taste, but appreciated by those favoring such bold combinations.

Despite the compact size, the service provided by the lone staff member was efficient and attentive, a notable positive in the intimate setting. However, when correlating the cost to the culinary experience, Mentoku's offerings seemed overpriced. The absence of patrons during peak hours hinted that others may share this sentiment. For those seeking the novelty of Mentoku, the yuzu-kosho or matcha ramen might be the more intriguing choices. Nonetheless, in a city bustling with ramen contenders, better value and more tantalizing options are just a stone's throw away.",1
20913,"Must try! My husband and I opted to try out the omakase here rather than our usual go to restaurant on the UES. We loved everything about Inase. The atmosphere is quiet and comfortable while service was friendly and efficient. We opted for the $120 omakase. Everything piece of food served was fresh and delicious. The first course was a plate of perfection, from the tomatoes soaked in dashi broth to the shrimp toast.  The sushi itself was very fresh and served in large pieces with the perfect amount of rice to go with it. We enjoyed talking to the sushi chef during our meal as he made the whole experience relaxed and still enjoyable. My husband and I walked out really full and happy that we found our new go-to omakase spot.",0
15934,"Scallion pancakes here are very tasty and greasy with a nice crispiness. Thought it was inventive to utilize as a tortilla and stuff with beef and cucumber, however the beef was the grossest quality and quite traumatic. Very fatty, rubbery, thick slices I had to take out one by one. Great concept, nice size, but PLEASE step up the quality of whatever type of mystery garbage was inside. Wayyy too many cilantro leaves embedded as well. Overpowering and not fun to pull out of my teeth. On the plus side... they have dumplings on happy hour special (starting 3pm) which are pretty tasty and a generous portion.",0
15688,"Only stopped in for a quick drink but the food looked delicious. They have a bar at the front of the restaurant and tables as you work your way back. Seems like a good place to bring kids as they have some booth seats and slightly more space towards the back of the restaurant and other section of tables on the other side of the bar. I only ordered one cocktail, With Love From Emily, which was really good! I'll have to come back to try their pizza.",0
2262,"Lovely place the vibe is very nice! I highly recommend for a date night. They do the bbq for you at your table. I really liked the galbi and the marinated galbi! The noodles came with fish, which wasn't really for me but the actual noodles and vegetables were really delicious and I love that kind of spice. I give it four stars mostly due to the price point which I thought was high for the area.",0
12907,"Iight so boom. YES MA'AM! I pulled up with my mans to Cantina for Taco Tuesdayyyy! It was my first time at the establishment but I was promised quality tacos & tequila and that is EXACTLY what I got here.We sat at the bar and was immediately given menus and glasses of water. We did miss happy hour but on Taco Tuesday it's $3 tacos all around. Wonderful. My mans charged his phone on the chargers installed into the bar (kudos to them for having) while I scanned the menu. My eyes landed on a patron azul which was essentially a patron and blue liquer drink--I was intrigued. My mans said he promised the classic house margarita would be more than enough....and he wasn't lying. After a couple of sips I FELT IT and after watching the gentlemen behind the bar make it I saw why....they are not shy with the tequila...I LOVE IT!To eat, I ordered the sriracha shrimp taco, mango jerk chicken taco and grilled lime chicken taco. Honestly can't pick a favorite. I tried REALLY REALLY hard to pick a favorite but they all were soooooooooo goooood omg. On a crisp flour tortilla, flavor like you can't imagine, not shy with the meat and toppings. Fresh. Perfect. Tacos. Ugh. My mans ordered the battered fish, steak and pork taco to which he thoroughly enjoyed, and the buffalo wings which were TRUE buffalo. Like he was legit sweating (he says perspiring) from eating them and the buffalo scent wafted through my nose the entire time. I wanted to have one but was too focused on the tacos. But we ate EVERYTHING, not one crumb left behind.We sat at the bar a little while longer to let everything digest and our lovely waiter Valentine (Valentino, sorry if I'm wrong in the spelling!) offered us a round of tequila shots. WHEW! (It was towards closing, we had engaged in nice conversation so this was simply a nice and thoughtful gesture on his end, not a standard practice)All in all, we had a great time. I will absolutely be back if not to this location then one of the others. Quality all around, affordable and just a great ambiance. Woohoo!",0
14832,"Title: A Hidden Gem for Authentic Treats in Chinatown

After several visits, I'm compelled to give this unpretentious spot a stellar 5-star rating. It's become apparent that the buns here are superior to those at the surrounding mainstream Chinatown bakeries. The staff deserves commendation for their patience, allowing customers to peruse the selection without pressure.

The red bean bun is an absolute delight, taking the top spot in my list of favorites. It's followed closely by the pineapple bun, which, despite its name, features a beautiful crisscross patterned glaze rather than any fruit filling. The egg tart is another must-try, with its silky custard and flaky crust.

Availability can be hit or miss later in the day – the red bean and pineapple buns often sell out, though there's usually a steady supply of egg tarts. For savory cravings, I highly recommend their onigiri, particularly the Japanese purple rice with crab meat, though the roasted pork is a close second, both priced around $2.25 each.

This bakery is a standout spot that deserves your visit – and an early one at that, to get the best selection of their delectable offerings.",1

If you're hunting for the best bang-for-your-buck salad bar in NYC, look no further than Bocca Bliss. With their $10 create-your-own salad option, you're in for a treat of an enormous bowl packed with unlimited toppings. And we're talking premium selections here—scrumptious proteins, a variety of cheeses, rich avocados, and an extra splash of your favorite dressing.

The place isn't just about good value; the staff's cheerful demeanor makes it all the more pleasant. Their efficient catering service has repeatedly impressed with its consistency and quality, solidifying Bocca Bliss as my top deli choice near the office. Even with the arrival of Just Salad across the street, Bocca Bliss continues to reign supreme with its stellar salad bar offerings.",1
224,"During Restaurant Week, I had the pleasure of visiting a charmingly decorated Korean BBQ spot.

1793,"Tucked away near Rockefeller, this unassuming spot may not catch your eye at first glance with its somewhat seedy exterior. However, venture inside and up the steps to discover a charming modern oasis. My mid-afternoon visit was met with a quiet ambiance, as only a few diners were present, allowing for immediate seating. Service was swift and attentive, with our order being taken promptly. The food arrived quickly, and to my delight, prices were reasonable without compromising on quality. This little gem truly offers an experience that belies its modest entrance.",1
10820,"Upon a spontaneous craving for Mediterranean delights, my companions and I found ourselves at a tastefully simple eatery I had earmarked earlier in the year. Tucked into the back right of the restaurant, service commenced promptly with menus, though a slight delay in receiving water and taking our orders was noted.

Eager to indulge, we chose a diverse selection of mezzas priced at a reasonable $6 each. Our group of three savored a delectable array, including roasted beets with a creamy cheese base, a fiery feta spread, a cooling yogurt dip, spiced carrots, classic hummus, and a unique Brussels sprout slaw. Though some specific dishes escape my memory, the complimentary hot bread loaves and olives, alongside a bottle of satisfying Moroccan wine for $54, nearly completed our meal to perfection.

Venturing beyond the mezzas, we tried the ""cigars,"" which unfortunately fell short, being unexpectedly hefty and wrapped more like egg rolls than the anticipated delicate philo. However, the grilled lamb Kofta Kebabs at $31 were a standout, delivering the rich spice blend I had longed for, and complemented by charred pearl onions and tomatoes.

While the service began on a slower note, it gained momentum with increasing warmth from the staff. An odd request to return our menus was made to prevent soiling, and the ambient noise level rose with the restaurant's full capacity, somewhat amplified by the high ceilings. Future plans include an outdoor seating experience, but make no mistake – a return visit is certainly in the cards for another round of those exceptional small plates and robust lamb. A side of jasmine rice might be the only suggestion to elevate the lamb dish further.",1
19536,"My recent dining experience at this eatery was one to remember. The standout dish of the evening was undoubtedly the mouthwatering chicken, which lived up to its name with its rich, flavorful profile, perfectly tempered to our mild spice preference. The two burgers we ordered were satisfactory, though not remarkable; they seemed to be a unique take on the traditional American burger, reminiscent more of a sweet pita packed with tasty meat, similar to what one might find at Xi'an Famous Foods. While I can't claim to be an expert on this style of burger, the flavors were certainly enjoyable.

In addition, our server deserves commendation for his helpfulness. His advice on portion sizes was spot-on, as we found the amount of food just right and left nothing unfinished. Overall, the service and the chicken dish were the highlights, but there's certainly something intriguing about their take on burgers that might warrant a second visit for the curious palate.",1
20506,"Title: A Cozy Spot for Burgers and Mexican Fare

My recent visit to this charming restaurant was nothing short of delightful! This cozy establishment is the perfect blend of cleanliness, welcoming service, and a menu that boasts mouth-watering burgers and enticing Mexican cuisine.

Upon ordering their burger, I was met with a fresh, juicy delight that truly hit the spot. The deliciousness of the burger alone has me eagerly planning my next visit. To complement the meal, the drink specials were a pleasant surprise, featuring $6 margaritas and sangrias on a Saturday afternoon. Although slightly smaller in size compared to others, the portions were reasonable and provided great value for the price.

Overall, my experience was lovely, and I'm already looking forward to returning to sample their Mexican offerings. This lowkey gem really stands out for its great food and snug atmosphere.",1
12019,"AMAZING ""secret"" omakase inside a hotel room close to Ktown hosted by the renegade Chef David.  The hour-long experience consists of a 17-course tasting with 14 pieces of sushi, sunomono, an uni and ikura don rice dish, and a piece of tamago.  A great omakase experience that is truly one of a kind for $125 including tax and gratuity which is fantastic. Great for a small group or event with your friends. You are given a hotel card for 1001 in the lobby. When you walk into the room, there is a small lounge area with a sake machine and a terrace for warmer weather.  Everything is dimly lit with a hip vibe including the music!  The meal itself is very fast-paced and the dishes are cadenced very rapidly but you still have just enough time to savor each bite.  Worth a visit!  They release tickets on Resy a month in advance. The sushi itself is solid with many pieces flame torched for slight twist. Some highlights:1.  Mackerel: lightly brushed with soy sauce - fresh and perfect balance of flavors.2.   Alaskan spotted prawn: Loved!  Sweet and simple but with the full flavor of the juicy fresh prawn3.  Hokkaido scallop: Thick and fresh and sprinkled with a light scattering of smoky charcoal salt.  The salt definitely gave it a nice twist. 4.  Arctic char: Lightly brushed with a green yuzu kosho sauce that delivers a slow burn wasabi-like burn that lingers.  A nice twist and memorable.5.  Ankimo: Flame torches and Brushed with a smokey red wine braise that gives it a nice spiced flavor.6.  Zuke Akami toro: Melt-in-your-mouth delish with a brush of soy. 7.  Uni and Ikura don: Creamy and fresh classic uni with ikura over rice. Perfect mini don. 8. Tamago: Firm and sweet egg with a slight tings of umami. 9.  Shima aji: Flamed with a soy glaze and scallion. Flavorful with a tangy twist. 10. Kinmedai: Fresh thick sliced red snapper. Tender and with a nice wasabi kick. It's a good break with a mild flavor. 11. Akami: brushed with soy and lightly flame torched. A solid classic.  12.  Madai: Lightly flame torched with a brush of soy. Very fresh and a good balance of flavors. 13. Chu Toro: Fatty and thick with a nice balance of wasabi. 14. Crabmeat, cucumber, seaweed salad: Excellent with fresh lump crabmeat over sliced cucumber and seaweed.  15. Ikura: Fresh and wrapped with a high ""wall"" of nori and brushed with soy. Great balance of flavors. 16.  Otoro: Fatty and brushed with truffled sea salt. A great take on a classic standard. 17.  Hamachi: tender and fresh with just the perfect amount of rice and wasabi.",0
20708,"I came here for brunch in the summer time--I think it was one of the hottest days and we sat outside. The jazz music was good but a bit too loud. I ordered the HT omelet with mushrooms and another lady ordered an omelet with bacon. The order got mixed up--mine ended up with bacon and the other lady got ham. Luckily, I eat bacon but that could have been a big problem if you don't. The food was okay--I can't speak on their dinner and the service was okay, nothing memorable.

1469,"Title: Cozy Spot with a Marmalade to Remember

My Thursday morning visit to this charming eatery offered a swift seating experience for our party of three, with larger groups patiently waiting. The restaurant has a welcoming vibe, appealing to both tourists and locals, and the option for solo diners to perch at the counter is a nice touch.

Nestled in the back, the close-set tables did not detract from our comfort. Service was prompt, though our server seemed a touch weary, betraying a sigh here and there. The unlimited coffee and a choice of still or sparkling water were appreciated.

The short rib hash I ordered was tasty but didn't quite knock my socks off—however, the accompanying poppy seed toast with sublime orange marmalade was the showstopper, warranting a return visit on its own. A slight oversight by our server meant we weren't offered a choice of carb with our entrees, an option we noticed extended to nearby diners.

Be wary of the upsell on sides; they're not included and will add to your bill. Although our coffee cups were attentively refilled, I longed for a consistent serving temperature.

In summary, this spot is perfect for a post-Central Park outing, particularly for the toast and marmalade that I still can't stop thinking about.",1
2958,"I recently ordered a sushi platter for $20 and was pleased with the generous portion size. The sushi was notably fresh and the fish was satisfyingly meaty.

Overall, a worthwhile option for sushi lovers looking for quality and quantity.",1
1791,"Came here on a Saturday night; the place is pretty small and unfortunately they don't take reservations so we ended up waiting for some time before a table opened up. The atmosphere is warm and lively, with a bar near the front and dining tables at the back. Once we got seated, we ordered drinks which we also had to wait ~30 minutes to receive. Our waiter was very nice and apologized for the delay, but it was a little frustrating. I would recommend the Murgia Sour(amaro lucano, orange bitters, lemon juice, egg whites).For the food, we split the fritto misto, arancini, 16"" burrata pizza and the short rib lasagna. This was more than enough food. The arancini were delicious cheesy risotto croquettes; my only complaint was that there weren't more. The fritto misto was also a great mix of fried calamari, artichoke, scallops, and shrimp - I'd definitely recommend if you're looking for a varied (but fried) dish. The burrata pizza was good; very simple, thin crust pizza featuring burrata on a red sauce. Lastly, the short rib lasagna is a heartier, meaty dish that is also very well done. Overall, the food was delicious and our waiter was extremely nice and helpful. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is due to the wait at multiple points during the evening. However, the food made up for it and I would recommend if you want good Italian food in Harlem.",0
18022,"Title: Disappointing Experience at Famous Famiglia Pizzeria

I visited Famous Famiglia Pizzeria in the heart of Manhattan's Theater District on a Thursday afternoon, expecting a slice of the famed New York-style pizza. Regrettably, the experience fell far below expectations.

Quality: The cheese pizza I received did little to stimulate my appetite. It appeared overcooked with an off-color and featured a contradictory crust—crispy on the edges but unpleasantly doughy at the center. The sauce lacked any memorable flavor, overwhelmed by an excessive amount of garlic. It's safe to say, I found myself unable to endorse this slice amidst New York City's wealth of superior options.

Quantity: The slice was of a standard size, nothing more, nothing less.

Value: At $3.00 for a cheese slice, the cost would be reasonable if the quality wasn't so dire.

Ambiance: Despite its prime location near Times Square, the pizzeria's ambiance was disheartening. The place was unkempt, with overflowing trash cans and a coating of dust and food remnants on nearly every surface. It’s an environment that makes you want to sanitize immediately and vow never to return.

Crowd: There was a small line, likely due to the shop's proximity to tourist pathways rather than the food's draw.

Service: The staff's demeanor was shockingly unprofessional—rude and dismissive interactions with customers are unacceptable. The lack of cleanliness only added insult to injury.

Parking: As expected in the bustling center of Manhattan, parking is virtually non-existent.

In conclusion, Famous Famiglia Pizzeria was a letdown in both service and culinary delivery. There are far better places in New York City to enjoy a delicious slice of pizza, so I’d recommend pizza lovers steer clear and seek out a cleaner establishment with friendlier staff and, most importantly, tastier pizza.",1
11804,"I loved this little eatery.  It's divey and tiny with such a fun vibe.  The food was great and the service so prompt and friendly.  I imagine they can't help but be prompt as it's four steps from the service counter to your table!  Maybe even less!  We arrived just a bit before noon on a Sunday and there was one table available.  I believe the max number of diners that could pack in here would be about 24 people.  The dining area is maybe 150 or so square feet.  There's going to be a bit of elbow rubbing but it's all jolly good.  I thought I would hear a British accent or two from staff, but none that day.  Though everyone was so cheery, and they are well trained/experienced in moving effortlessly through the narrow spaces to serve the guests, as well as to assist guests in stashing their bags/coats and guiding people in and out the entry door.There's a single restroom and yeah, it's pretty small.  But clean and functional.We wanted a good solid brunch and the ""Full English"" sounded great to me.  Turned out to be even better than it sounded.  Hot, fresh, varied, and delicious. A beautiful plate.  I've heard that the Brits love their beans for breakfast and in keeping with the English way, put some on a piece of the accompanying warm toasty bread.  Yum! Over easy eggs were perfect.  My husband had the smoked salmon benedict and loved that too.  The accompanying 'mash' was pretty interesting, I think it was a mashup of potato and turnip with some greens.  Very special.  He also commented that the tomato was absolutely delicious and this from someone who really does not like tomatoes!I was puzzled to see only salt shakers on the tables, no pepper - then the waiter came around and offered fresh ground pepper - so classy.Yelp check-in gets you a free tea or coffee and as of this writing, Oscar's is taking part in the Yelp cashback program.  So you have even more reasons to give this place a try.    They actually will take a reservation for a group of four or more.  Otherwise, walk in and hope for the best.  I imagine in bad weather or heavy coat weather it will be difficult if you have to wait for a table because there's not a lot of space to do so inside.  Happily Spring is in the air so get yourself to Oscar's Place soon.  I hope to return!",0

The service is standardly brusque, with no-nonsense staff that are a hallmark of the area, but this is easily overshadowed by the exceptional food served at wallet-friendly prices. A word of caution to eager patrons: approach these delicious, juice-filled dumplings with care. They arrive at your table piping hot and prone to bursting, as I learned firsthand when an enthusiastic bite resulted in a mini eruption of flavorful broth onto my clothes. Take it slow, savor the experience, and you'll be rewarded with one of the tastiest treats Chinatown has to offer.",1

I mean, is your mouth-watering at all of this yummy goodness? I ordered spinach, brown rice, the simply roasted broccoli, super seed, and roasted freebird chicken thigh for a grand total of $12.

14545,"Title: A First Glimpse into the Spanish Delights of Little Spain at Hudson Yards

On my inaugural visit to the bustling Hudson Yards, curiosity led me to the beckoning signs of Little Spain, nestled below the grandeur of Neiman Marcus. As if transported to a vibrant Spanish marketplace, I was enveloped by the energy of Little Spain—a sprawling food haven where more than a dozen shops, restaurants, cafes, and bars converge to create a gastronomic tapestry rich in culture and flavor.

Even at 7:30 in the evening, the place was abuzz with an eclectic mix of tourists and local professionals unwinding post-work. With a welcoming schedule from 11 AM to 11 PM, Little Spain assures ample time for exploration, although some establishments have yet to unfurl their full potential.

Intriguingly flexible, the layout invites patrons to mix and match their dining experience. One might grab a bite from a stall, pair it with a drink from another, and settle into a cozy spot elsewhere—blurring the lines between restaurant and casual hangout. While I refrained from indulging this time, the prospects of Spanish Diner, La Barra, Lena, and Mar, along with the sweet allure of churros and savory bites like bocatas & empanadas, promise a return visit.

Prices reflect the New York standard, with certain items skewing towards the higher end, yet the experience seems to merit the cost. Little Spain is more than a dining destination; it's a place to immerse oneself in the essence of a Spanish market with the convenience of a single location. I left already planning my next visit, eager to savor the culinary offerings and soak in the atmosphere of this little slice of Spain in the heart of the city.",1
10009,This restaurant is incredibly delicious! We started with frozen margaritas and shared chips and guacamole- enough for a party of 4. Their carnitas main course was AMAZING!

10661,"Good quality food, but way, way way overpriced.  I didn't think any item was worth the high price.  The most overpriced dish I had was the corn truffle tempura.  Three little fried pieces for $32, and they weren't even good - so dry.  Duck foie Gras tacos - tasty Tai sea bream truffle - good, but so expensive for four tiny pieces. Beef fried rice - bland Fish pasta cilantro and batarda - this was my first time trying pasta made out of fish and I hated it!  The texture was gross to me, but others I dined with liked this dish so maybe it was just me.  Miso eggplant - very good.  Silky, delicious eggplant.  Kanpachi jalapeño potato julienne - never again.  $24 for four little pieces of sushi that was completely filled with little fried flakes and had the tiniest bit of fish on top (which I couldn't taste).  Biggest rip off of the night after the corn truffle.  Seared salmon avocado crispy flakes - good, fresh sushi, but nothing special.Chicken wings - piping hot, good chicken, but boring sauce.  I'm not a fan of Japanese desserts, so none of the desserts did much for me as expected.  Had a really cool looking green layer cake, but it looked better than it tasted.All in all, I don't think I'll ever return.  The high price tag was just not worth it -- no dish blew me away despite being super expensive.",0

If you're looking for high-quality Japanese cuisine at a great value, especially for lunch, this place is a standout. Here, you move past the usual suspects of sushi and ramen to delights such as a savory curry dish and perfectly grilled mackerel, which are my personal favorites. Of course, if you do crave sushi, they serve up those rolls with finesse too. Highly recommend for anyone wanting to explore the breadth of Japanese culinary excellence without breaking the bank.",1

20288,"Title: Cozy Ambiance and Reliable Thai Fare

I recently dined at a local Thai restaurant that offered a pleasant experience overall. The restaurant's decor is charming and inviting, making it an ideal spot for a romantic date or a casual outing with a few friends. 

The menu featured classic Thai dishes, and we opted to try the fresh spring rolls, calamari, and drunken noodles with shrimp. While none of the dishes completely wowed me, they were all reasonably enjoyable. The fresh spring rolls were refreshing, albeit a bit heavy on the iceberg lettuce; however, they were paired with an excellent dipping sauce. A spicy sauce option would have been appreciated, though. The calamari was cooked to perfection and was a hit at the table, although a more adventurous sauce could have elevated it further. As for the drunken noodles, they were a reliable choice and didn't disappoint, especially with the addition of shrimp.

While I wasn't entirely captivated by the food, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this restaurant if you find yourself nearby and in the mood for Thai cuisine. It's not a destination to seek out, but it's a fine choice for a satisfying meal in a lovely setting.",1
3407,"I couldn't remember the name of this place when I came here 3 years ago but I was sure I had to! The food was absolutely delicious then and it was even better now! As an appetizer we got the fried calamari and a side salad. The calamari was super fresh and cooked to perfection. Like the calamari, the salad was super fresh crisp. For our entree, We got the Margherita pizza with ricotta, sausage, pepperoni, roasted peppers, and sun dried tomatoes. The pizza, just like last time, was super crispy and packed with flavor. My girlfriend got the rigatoni a la vodka, super creamy and savory with the bits of crispy bacon. For drink we both got Sangria and although it was great, it was not bad at all! Highly recommend this place, great atmosphere, lighting, and super friendly staff!",0
16810,"Title: Underwhelmed by the Hyped Eatery

My quest for a local culinary gem led me to this much-talked-about storefront, branching out from a local food truck scene. With expectations high, I visited on a quiet Thursday night at 8pm, only to find myself the sole diner—a first hint that perhaps the buzz was louder than the bite.

The menu, a nondescript board behind the counter, offered no particular thrills. Torn between the vaunted lobster roll and a tantalizing lobster quesadilla, the cashier’s suggestion swayed me toward the latter. Unfortunately, the allure of the display photo wasn't matched by what landed on my plate—speedy service yielded a forgettable meal. The quesadilla, while competent, lacked the robust flavors I've encountered in lesser shrimp variants elsewhere.

In the end, while I'm glad to have satisfied my curiosity, the experience fell flat. Disappointment was the lingering taste, and I see no reason for a second visit.",1
18988,"Upon my initial visit to this sushi spot, I was initially perplexed by the somewhat limited selection of sushi rolls on the menu. However, my skepticism was quickly put to rest after placing my order.

Accompanied by impeccable service that allowed for a relaxed, unrushed dining experience, with dishes arriving individually to prevent a cluttered table, the meal was nothing short of exceptional. My verdict is clear: this restaurant is a must-visit for any sushi aficionado, and I eagerly anticipate my next visit.",1
17255,"Title: A Hit-and-Miss Experience at 95 HomeDish

My recent experience at 95 HomeDish was a mixed bag. The restaurant's large round tables and convenient lazy Susans are perfect for group dining, setting the stage for a communal Cantonese feast. We dove into an ambitious selection of ten dishes, and while there were standouts, there were also significant disappointments.

On the positive side, the beef chow fun with gravy stood out with its savory flavors, as did the aromatic claypot braised fish and tofu. The watercress with garlic and Singapore mei fun were other highlights, showcasing fresh ingredients and robust seasoning.

However, not all that glitters is gold. The sesame chicken was a low point, with meat quality so subpar it hinted at a frozen and reheated past - a letdown even for an Americanized dish. The lobster sticky rice and Yang Chow fried rice also fell flat, failing to live up to expectations.

The BYOB policy is a plus, and credit card acceptance adds convenience. In all, 95 HomeDish offers a chance at a delightful meal, provided you stick to their hits and steer clear of the misses.",1
1112,"This place is one of two locations on the upper east side; while I've never been to the one on 1st Ave., I can say the one on second ave is pretty decent. I've been here twice now and haven't had a disappointing meal. I think this is your standard reliable diner with an upscale feel. The first time I came, I ordered an omelet with sweet potato fries. Must admit the fries were cooked to perfection. Not a soggy one in the mix. This time I came and got one of the  specials, Baja shrimp tacos. The order came with three well dressed corn flour tortillas with a flavorful pico and a decent guacamole. All together not too bad. Would come back and try some of their other greek specialties for sure.",0
12467,"Came here with a friend last night to celebrate my 31st birthday. I turned to Yelp and typed in ""tapas"" in the Greenwich Village area, which led me to Alta. I made a reservation on Yelp and under special notes wrote ""birthday""-- they were very sweet and printed a menu with Happy Birthday Marla on it. We were seated on the top floor which is stunning! Gorgeous warm ambiance with very attentive servers and bussers. Our server suggested a $60 bottle of Sauv Blanc which did not disappoint. Yum!However, the food just missed the mark for us... we ordered 4 tapas: Brussel sprouts, scallops with yuzu, black truffle ravioli, and crispy polenta. Brussel sprouts-- best thing we ate all night. Fabulous!Scallops with yuzu-- where was the yuzu? Only got a tiny lick of the yuzu on the plate which was disappointing. The scallops were also medium rare which was not stated in the description on the menu. I prefer a medium scallop due to texture. Black truffle Ravioli-- ages Gouda inside was good but I had no explosive black truffle flavor at all. So surprised. The sauce was grainy and black but very little truffle flavor. Ugh. Crispy polenta-- sauce was underwhelming. Polenta was nice texture but not cheesy in flavor or texture. At the end of the meal, we had witnessed another table celebrating a birthday which got a candle and the servers sang which they didn't offer me but it's okay. Overall, service was great, ambiance was pretty and food was very average (menu options look incredible but the flavors didn't deliver). For us spending $180 on dinner, I just would've expected more.",0
17475,"This place is perfectly OK, especially for its location, right by Times Square. If you're in the area and want a quick bite to eat, this is a good option.However, coming form California and my love of Mexican food, their tacos here are good, but they're not out-of-this-world amazing. This isn't a must-try place by any means, but it's solid. There's always a line, but it moves quickly. I think their best (and also their most unique) item is the queso taco where the tortilla is actually made of fried cheese. It's so good and it's very filling. I highly prefer this over their regular tacos, but I don't think I could eat more than one of them. I've been here twice when I've been in the area and I've gotten two al pastor tacos and one with the queso taco shell and this has been a good order. I'm not too impressed by the normal street tacos. I didn't find the meat to be too flavorful, but it was still good. I just wouldn't come out of my way to go here by any means.One problem with this place is that it's standing room only. This is generally okay, but if it's super crowded (especially in winter when everyone has lots of big layers on), it can feel uncomfortable when you're eating in such close quarters. Again, not a deal breaker and it's kind of a fun atmosphere when you're in the mood -- but if you're not in the mood for it, it's kind of annoying. Don't miss the salsa bar after you pick up your order for some extra zing.",0
15832,"Food was AMAZING. And the roasted pineapple margarita was not too sweet and dangerously yummy. The service was a little meh, and the reason for only 4 stars, I wanted to give 2 but the food was too food and drinks...when we finally got them was too good for that.",0

Although the pork chops were slightly on the dry side, both the steak and salmon hit the mark, cooked to perfection. A standout was the onion loaf served with whipped butter—so scrumptious we couldn't resist requesting another. The drinks we chose complemented our meals beautifully, leaving us thoroughly satisfied. Would definitely recommend this spot for a great dining experience!",1

I had the Vietnamese Chicken Bowl with the House Mixed Salad. Decent veggies, chicken cooked just right it's perfect. The sauce is light and brussel sprouts are good but a couple were pretty burnt so some are really bitter. Overall, tasty and I had a fulfilling dinner. Friendly staffs and clean place inside. Tables and seats to eat in but easy and pretty fast for takeouts too. Walkable to bus stops and subway stations. Not my go to spot but if I'm around and need lunch or dinner, it's not a bad option.",0
18054,"Amazing vodka pizza. If coming for dinner, highly recommend a reservation. I came for lunch on Sunday afternoon right at opening (11:30am) and there was no wait. If you wait until noon there would've been! My 2 friends and I split a large pizza 1/2 vodka and 1/2 bianca for $27. More than enough food for 3 girls. They cut the pizza into 8 slices. I rate 5/5 for the vodka slices which were thin, crispy and delicious. 3/5 for bianca slices only because they were not crispy due to the layer of ricotta cheese. Still tasty!  The bathroom will cook you like an oven which might possibly add stress if you need to go #2...",0
19520,"Title: A Satisfying Detour to Tri Dim Shanghai

In an impromptu quest for the best soup dumplings beyond our go-to Joe Shanghai, my fiancé and I found ourselves at the surprisingly upscale Tri Dim Shanghai. Our visit at the unusual hour of 3PM on a Saturday meant plenty of open tables, providing a relaxed dining atmosphere. A Yelp check-in bonus treated us to a complimentary quartet of chicken dumplings.

Our culinary journey started with crab and pork soup dumplings, which arrived at a perfectly palatable warmth, allowing us to savor the rich, flavorful broth and soft meat with ease, albeit a hint more seasoning for the meat would have been welcome. The chicken dumplings that followed paled in comparison, lacking moisture and flavor to the extent that soy sauce became a necessity.

It was the steamed pork buns that stole the show. Emitting an appetizing steam upon unveiling, they were almost too hot to handle at first touch. Yet, the wait was worthwhile; the buns were pillowy, encasing a succulent mix of sweet and savory glazed pork. Their delectable taste warranted an encore, prompting us to indulge in a second serving.

Tri Dim Shanghai turned out to be a delightful diversion from our routine, and I wholeheartedly recommend it for anyone looking to indulge in some quality dim sum.",1
15577,"Recently visited NYC for business and a coworker mentioned this hotspot. Yep, you guessed it: definitely worth the hype. Only issue is seating at this location. I went alone, so I got lucky and nabbed the single window seat once someone left. There are only 4-5 seats total. I got the spicy cumin lamb noodles (N1) and the spicy cumin lamb dumplings (and asked for extremely spicy for both). Noodles were thiccc and chewy, just like I like them (and just as they should be)! For all you spice lovers, ""extremely spicy"" wasn't *too* spicy at all. Good balance of szechuan spice, so you're still tasting all of the flavors of the meat but also getting heat. You'll get the slightest tingly/mouth numbing sensation at this spice level, but nothing extreme. I wish it was a touch spicier since they do have milder levels, and also wish there was a bit more lamb in my portion--it was only the pieces you see there on the top. Dumplings were just as good. The filling was generously sized and the dough wasn't too thick. I think ""extremely spicy"" comes through a bit more in this dish (as evidenced by the pile of chilis on top of the dumplings). Still a great balance of flavors. Nothing gets overpowered by the spice. Definitely revisiting during my next NY trip!",0
14574,"We made a reservation for 7 pm on a Friday, and it was full, but not packed when we arrived. The ambiance is very bright, and I could imagine how beautiful it looks during the day. I ordered the Happy Soda ($6), and it was the perfect amount of sweet with a subtle rose flavor, which was refreshing. For an appetizer, we ordered the Roti Prata ($9.50). The curry sauce was delicious, and the Roti was huge. We also ordered the Chicken Satay ($10), which was perfectly seasoned with an excellent peanut sauce layered on top. For an entree, I ordered the Singapore Laksa ($18) with chicken, which was very flavorful and filling. My partner ordered the Prawn Mee ($24), which was not her favorite, but that is because of her preference, it was still cooked very well. If you like fishey broth than you will like the Prawn Mee, but if you do not I don't recommend. We ordered the Rendang Beef ($22), which was very tender and flavorful with a slight kick. Overall, this restaurant has a great ambiance, staff, and menu. Compared to the restaurant around the block Laut, it is very similar, but with a shorter wait.",0
15200,"I recently had the pleasure of dining at a local Chinese eatery, introduced to me by a friend, and I must say, the experience was transformative. The highlight of my meal was the three-dumpling wanton soup, which was nothing short of amazing. Its rich flavor and delicate dumplings set a high bar for any future soups I might try. The prices were reasonable, and the service was impressively quick. Eagerly looking forward to my next visit, I highly recommend this spot for an authentic and satisfying meal.",1
11969,"Title: A Hidden Gem for Pizza Lovers

I'm astonished that Grandma's Margherita Pizza has flown under the radar without a chorus of acclaim or even a Yelp presence until now. Since relocating to the area, my pizza experiences have hit a new high, not just locally but in all of NYC.

Don't let the prices mislead you; while it's not your bargain $2 slice joint, the $20 specialty large pizzas are a steal for the quality you get. The ingredients could not taste fresher, and the crust is a revelation in and of itself—crispy, yet chewy, and perfectly baked. But the real showstopper is the FRESH HOMEMADE CHEESE. It brings the pizza to a league of its own.

On top of exceptional food, the delivery is consistently on time, if not early, eliminating the usual anticipation (or frustration) that comes with most delivery services. The sauce is noteworthy, with a hint of sweetness that complements the tang of the tomatoes beautifully.

Moreover, the ambiance of the clean, family-run restaurant adds to the charm. And do not leave without trying the carrot cake—it rounds off the meal perfectly and leaves you with a sweet memory of your visit.

We've become regulars for the large Margherita pizza, and it's worth mentioning how well it reheats—rare for most takeout pizzas. It's time Grandma's Margherita Pizza gets the recognition it deserves. Next time you're in town, give it a try; you won't regret it.",1
15778,"This is my second time eating here, and it has not disappointed me. They gave a good amount of noodles and broth with their ramen, and both the Curry and Enter the Dragon were delicious. Enter the dragon had the right amount of spicy where it didn't cause my throat to get caught with the spices or miss the other flavors in the soup.  The service here is amazing; the server is very attentive to checking in on how we were. I definitely need to try to the pork buns next time though. I keep on eyeing it.",0
16369,"Title: A Hidden Gem in East Village – Doma Delights!

I recently had the pleasure of dining at Doma, an East Village eatery that deserves far more attention than it gets. Tucked away with a neon sign to lure you in, this spot is a cozy yet hip enclave perfect for a lively girls' night out.

The interior speaks volumes about its modern taste, with decorative touches that complement the cute and stylish tableware. Welcomed warmly upon arrival, the service at Doma was impeccable. Attentive servers introduced each dish with a description of its contents, adding a personal touch that enhanced our dining experience.

As a Korean food enthusiast, I was in heaven. Each dish was a delightful adventure, but the KFC (Korean Fried Chicken) stole the show with its irresistible juiciness and robust flavors. The Korean ceviche was a refreshing opener, beautifully presented and bursting with zest. The traditional fare, from stews to pancakes and bibimbap, was infused with innovative twists that kept my palate pleasantly surprised throughout the meal.

Doma strikes a brilliant balance between traditional and novel, making it a must-visit for those looking to explore Korean cuisine with a modern flair. Don't miss out on this culinary treasure!",1
2589,"After seeing Hamilton, we were looking for a place to have a lite dinner. Most everything was closed. Huh? This is NYC! After using Yelp, we found the Madison Restaurant which is actually a diner. Being that I'm from NJ, I'm very familiar with the diner scene and I am always amazed by the volume and variety of items available 24 hours a day. The typical burgers, sandwiches, salads, eggs and pancakes plus chicken Parmesan, lobster, gyros, chicken piccata, the list goes in and on. We both decided to go with the chicken Parmesan sandwich and asked them to hold the bread. We ordered fries to split, each had an iced tea, and decided to try desert. Our waiter was friendly and efficient, always refilling our iced tea. The chicken Parmesan was good, a thin cutlet with a tangy tomato sauce and melted mozzarella cheese. It really hit the spot. Then the bill came, and even by NY standards, it was high. $75! Yikes. While we enjoyed our dinner and were grateful to find a restaurant open at midnight in this area, I'd never make a point to come back based on the high prices.",0
3097,"I recently discovered Tenho Ramen in my new neighborhood and it's already a favorite! My boyfriend and I visited on a Sunday evening post-holiday shopping and were delighted by the modern, clean ambiance and the high-tech touches (a motion-sensored, heated toilet added a unique touch of novelty). With no wait at 6PM and a lively atmosphere, we dove into the menu.

We started with the handmade gyoza ($7), which hit the mark with its crispy exterior and flavorful filling. For our mains, the spicy ramen ($16) and kogashi garlic ramen ($16) were both winners. The broth was thicker than usual, imparting a cozy, homemade feel that was truly comforting. The staff also deserves a shout-out for their attentive and kind service.

Overall, Tenho Ramen left us full and satisfied. We're looking forward to our next visit!",1
13798,"Quick and easy pizza and salad place near Grand Central. My friend and I came here for a quick dinner in the city before a concert.

The place is a pretty typical Pizza place where you can pick our toppings for your own pizza or choose one of the premade options. We picked on of their specials of the week and split one. One pizza was enough for the two of us. We also ordered some wine (they have little cute cups of repackaged wine) which was fun! I had never seen those repackaged wine cups before.

15487,"Title: Cozy Italian Pre-Theater Dining at Bocca di Bacco

Nestled conveniently near Broadway, Bocca di Bacco charms with its unique take on Italian cuisine, offering a delightful departure from the standard Italian-American fare. The service shines; our waitress was attentive and affable, ensuring a pleasant dining experience from start to finish.

Although the Manhattan location comes with expectantly steep prices, the food quality almost justifies the cost. However, the portions felt somewhat meager when considering the price point, which detracts slightly from the overall value, hence a small ding in the rating.

Our choices for the evening, the Fusilli Alla Norcia and Spaghetti Con Langostini, showcased the kitchen's capabilities. The fusilli, a twist on the classic Penne Alla Vodka, was tasty but could benefit from a more generous serving. In contrast, the spaghetti was a visual and gastronomic treat, adorned with an array of well-cooked, fresh seafood that complemented the perfectly al dente pasta.

While we bypassed dessert on this occasion, the overall good food and excellent service have left me eager to return for a complete three-course experience. Definitely a spot to consider for a pre-show meal with a touch of Italian authenticity.",1
3075,"Title: A Trendy Tsukemen Experience at TabeTomo

My friend and I decided to try out TabeTomo for dinner post-work, arriving at their 5pm opening to avoid the rush. It was a wise decision; although they don't accept reservations, seating was swift and by the time we left, the popular new spot was bustling, yet still queue-free.

The superb service truly stood out. Our server was a gem, offering clear, friendly guidance through the straightforward menu—a relief for the indecisive diner. A minor snag occurred when the manager appeared overbearing, particularly while we settled our bill, somewhat detracting from the otherwise relaxed atmosphere.

The décor impressed with its hip vibe, setting the stage for our encounter with their specialty: tsukemen. The tonkatsu chashu tsukemen was a generous portion, boasting 5 slices of chashu, a flawlessly executed soft boiled egg, and fresh veggies. While critiques of the fatty, garlicky broth exist, I personally relished its boldness, enhanced by a tangy splash of vinegar. The lukewarm serving temperature did mean our chashu lost its warmth, but the noodles remained delightfully firm and springy.

The tori kawa appetizer, however, was a miss for me. Its excessive saltiness and heavy batter strayed far from the anticipated Cantonese crispy-skin chicken experience.

In conclusion, TabeTomo excels in introducing tsukemen to novices, offering value with quality akin to pricier establishments, minus some warmth in the chashu. Service shines, the environment captivates, and despite minor hiccups, it's a dining adventure well worth embarking on.",1
15972,"We came in last weekend for dinner. We made reservations for 6 and I sure am glad we did! The place is so tiny! There really only are just a few tables and some seats at the bar(ish) area that overlooks the kitchen. By the time we left, there were a lot of people lined up outside. The service was pretty quick. Not overly friendly but that was fine. We ordered the kale gnocchi and the lamb pappardelle. The gnocchi was very ok. It was very fluffy and pillow as good gnocchi should be. The sauce on top was alright. It just didn't have much flavor. The pappardelle was very good though. I would love to come in the try the daily specials though. It's also cash only which is always just disappointing.",0
18377,"Tina's is a gem for both a quick bite and a hearty meal. The empanadas, prominently showcased in the window, are absolutely delicious, whether you opt for chicken or beef. Do yourself a favor and get them with the green sauce—just the right level of spice for an extra kick, unless you're spice-averse.

Moving on to the mains, the Ropa Vieja, with its succulent shredded beef in a robust tomato sauce, paired with yellow rice and plantains, is my go-to. For those not in the mood for beef, the Chicken Fricasse is a winner, maintaining the high bar set by the rest of the menu. Portions are generous; I often have leftovers for a second meal.

The steady crowd during lunchtime tells you all you need to know about Tina's appeal in a bustling city like New York. Highly recommend for a taste of divine Latin cuisine.",1

17160,"Title: A Decent Ramen Experience with Room for Flair

As a ramen enthusiast venturing through the city's diverse culinary landscape, expect your palate to encounter a mosaic of flavors, especially in the vibrant village area, known for its competitive ramen scene. Amid this backdrop, my colleagues and I stumbled upon a spot boasting a unique array of ramen dishes.

The lunchtime allure of a ramen special complemented by either a crisp salad or golden karaage was tough to resist. I opted for the Tan Tan Men, anticipating the robust zest I've come to relish. The dish was satisfactory, but not remarkable. The sauce, while competent, lacked depth, the noodles did not differentiate themselves from the norm, and the karaage, though competently prepared, was just standard fare. Even the execution of the soft-boiled egg, although precise, failed to elevate the overall dish.

In essence, this ramen joint delivers a serviceable meal – you'll walk away content, but not captivated. It's the culinary equivalent of a solid baseline play, but in a neighborhood dotted with ace servers, you might find yourself yearning for a spot that serves up a more dynamic game.",1

I had the honey siracha shrimp with the garlic shrimp scampi for my first round.  After that all my refills were the garlic shrimp scampi which came out piping hot and full of flavor each time.  Our waiter was on point, he kept our drinks and shrimp refills in a steady rotation.  His attentiveness was greatly appreciated.  Aside from the delicious food,  the service was great which makes up for the Karaoke fails towards the end.",0

2094,"A decent location, I took my co-workers here for our annual restaurant week celebration. Overall we had a good time here for a Broadway restaurant.La Masseria is very close to Broadway (literally a few steps from some theaters.) This means, depending on when you go, they can either be crowded or not. As we walked through crowded Times Square to get here the place was only half full. Our reservations were at 12:30pm so I am assuming that 2-3 hours before shows (5-8?) a place like this gets much more crowded. I suspect coming outside those times to get the best experience here.The food we got here was decent. You get an appetizer and an entree which are both decently sized. I would complain a lot more about it not coming with dessert (which most participating restaurants offer) but they do give tables a lot of bread/breadsticks. You got to love that about Italian places! The portions were fairly good as well and the entree is filling. I had the stuffed mozzarella which was fantastic! I wish I could say the same about the gnocchi though it was slightly heavy for my tastes. Service was also fairly good. Often waiters would come over to offer extra cheese and/or pepper. Our food didn't take too long to come either and we enjoyed the rustic atmosphere of the restaurant. It reminded me a little of Paesano's on Mulberry Street (minus the shovels.)La Masseria is a nice Italian restaurant.

I recently dined at what I can only describe as a noodle nirvana, the first US noodle restaurant honored with a Michelin star – and it's clear why. Nabbing a bar spot on a weekday allowed me the pleasure of sampling the Gochu Ramyun. True to its Korean namesake meaning ""pepper,"" this dish packed a spicy punch without compromising on an intricate flavor profile. Every component sang: the broth was a savory revelation with just the perfect hint of salt, the noodles boasted an ideal al dente bite, and the sesame/shiso topping added a masterful flavor contrast. While I've encountered more tender pork elsewhere, the dish as a whole was utterly unputdownable. Service matched the high standards of the food—exceptional and enlightening. Though initially set on the prix fixe, the two-person minimum meant a change in course, but it’s a minor detail – I’m already planning my return visit.",1

I got the octopus, while delicious I will say it looked like the table next to us got a larger portion (or more potatoes because theirs was piled high) We also got tagliatelle and the hanger steak. No complaints all around! All I can say is there was a small steak to potato ratio, but the bit of steak that was on the plate was delicious.  the meal was MUCH better paced this time. The cheese cake first, then octopus was brought same time and brad wanted them to leave the cheese and they didn't take it. Then pasta and steak same exact time which I don't think is bad?4.5 all around round up to 5 for the overall pleasant and great experience.For the cheese, octopus, tagliatelle hanger steak, two beers, 1 cocktail the total was $117 which is not bad at all for NYC standards!!",0
16069,"I like this restaurant. Based on the menu, I'd say this place is pretty authentic. For appetizers, I was impressed by the foie gras. It's hard to find foie gras cooked in this ""grilled"" way. It's one of my favorite. We also ordered escargot. They were amazing. The sauce was really good. For main course, my friend got the steak. It was very good but a little bit over cooked, as she ordered it as medium rare. It tasted like medium well. I ordered stewed beef. I believe that it's a French classic and I personally do not like it too much. Overall it's a nice restaurant with great food. Service was solid and price is about right.",0
14853,"On a frigid NYC morning, we sought refuge at this eatery for brunch. We tried the omelette, which was pleasant but fairly ordinary. It didn't quite stand out enough to warrant a repeat visit.",1
1301,"During a recent business trip, I dined solo at this gem of a restaurant and left utterly satisfied. The menu’s extensiveness is a foodie’s dream, catering to diverse palates. I indulged in the kaisen chuka soba, an ideal pick for those torn between sashimi and noodles. Although the noodles themselves didn't hit the mark for me due to their flimsy texture, the accompanying dipping sauce was spot on, enhancing the overall flavor of the meal. Surprisingly, the pricing was very reasonable for New York standards – my dish was just under $14, a pleasant surprise given the city's reputation for steep dining costs. The attentive and friendly service added to the overall positive dining experience. I'd definitely recommend gathering a group to enjoy the variety this place has to offer.",1
1534,"If you've never been, it's a must. The Emmy Burger 100% lives up to the hype. We had made a reservation for Saturday at 3pm a few days prior and were seated right away in a great corner window spot. There were two of us and we split:-Shredded sprout salad: pickled mushroom, cashews, buttermilk bleu, miso. -The Arenstein pink pizza: pepperoni, pickled chili, honey.-The Emmy Burger: LaFrieda dry-aged beef, EMMY sauce, caramelized onion, American cheese, & pickles on a pretzel bun - with curly fries..... we were extremely stuffed and of course cleaned the plates empty.Everything was very good and well portioned. If you aren't a fan of the blue cheese, don't get the shredded sprout salad, lots of big chunks. We ordered this thinking it was healthy but it definitely wasn't the healthiest of salads lol. The burger was SO juicy and on point... note it will be very messy, you just have to let it happen. The pizza was a great combo balance of salty with a little sweet from the honey. Would definitely like to try just about every other pizza on the menu. The only thing that bothered us was that we asked our waiter for a side of emmy sauce to dip our fries in and he was jolly and said no problem! What he forgot to mention, was that it was going to be an extra $2 for a tiny ketchup cup size worth. If he had told us that upfront / before we saw it on the check, we probably wouldn't have gotten it.",0
1755,"Title: A Hidden Gem of Culinary Delights Amidst Ongoing Development

Upon visiting this little-known establishment, I was immediately struck by the sophisticated charm of its mid-century modern ambiance. A warm welcome complemented the aesthetically pleasing interior, making us forget the less developed surroundings outside.

The culinary experience was nothing short of remarkable. The scallops, petite in size, delivered an explosion of flavor that left me yearning for more. While the grilled octopus, accompanied by a tangy green sauce and a medley of pickled vegetables, was enjoyable, it somewhat fell short of the high bar set by my previous ventures.

The highlight of our meal was undoubtedly the Bronzino. Served whole, its presentation was as impressive as its taste. The option to have it filleted offered appreciated flexibility. Without any sides, it stood out in its pure, unadulterated form—a testament to the chef's confidence in their craft.

The drink pairings were a delightful surprise, with unusual yet harmonious combinations enhancing the dining experience. Their artisanal bread and butter, a simple starter, set a promising stage for the meal to come.

Service was impeccable. The staff, with their insightful knowledge of the menu, guided us through our selections, ensuring a seamless dining experience.

While the neighborhood may still be in transition, the restaurant's charm and the quality of its offerings make it a destination worth seeking out. It's a place where food and ambiance coalesce to create an unforgettable evening.",1
18701,"Title: A Bite of Heaven at Emily in NYC

I recently stumbled upon a New York City restaurant, Emily, a spot renowned for its burgers, and I must confess it lived up to the hype—exceeding the high bar I cautiously set. The Emily Burger, with its two succulent patties, oozing cheese, and divine special sauce, nestled in a pretzel bun that masterfully absorbed the flavors, catapulted itself into my top three burger experiences nationwide. 

The unexpected delight didn’t end there; the Detroit-style pizza, commonly overshadowed by New York-style pies, was a revelation with its deep-dish appeal that easily won over my taste buds. It's a must-try for anyone seeking culinary bliss outside the Big Apple pizza box.

To top off the indulgent feast, the restaurant serves authentic bottled Coke, which, in my opinion, is the only way to truly enjoy this classic beverage. Coupled with the warm and accommodating service, Emily deserves nothing less than a five-star rating. Excellent burgers, sublime pizza, and the perfect Coke make it a mandatory stop for food connoisseurs in NYC.",1
20920,"From the moment I stepped into the restaurant, I was captivated by its charming ambiance and delightful decor, especially the inviting bar area. My dining experience was marked by the exquisite pork chop, which was seared to perfection, offering a symphony of flavor with every bite. While slightly on the salty side, the accompanying sweet potatoes provided a lovely balance to the seasoning. A standout dish that impressed me profoundly was the caviar potatoes — an indulgence I'd gladly return for. Equally noteworthy was the octopus served atop a bed of squid ink pasta. It was a testament to the chef's prowess, being tender, fresh, and not the least bit chewy. This establishment has certainly earned a spot on my list of favorites, and I eagerly anticipate my next visit.",1
10511,"Food was good, I got the smash burger (no bun so it would be gluten free) The staff here was very unfriendly that's why it only received two stars from me. When ordering a drink the bartender acted like I was interrupting her alone time. When ordering food the waiter was very nasty. He also screwed up my order twice and the check. I'm very unsatisfied, and I hardly ever complain about top rated restaurants",0
16928,"A few friends and I came here after church on a Sunday afternoon. Lucky for us, there was no wait to get a table for our party of 6. This place is spacious and lovely with chandeliers, red and gold walls, white tablecloths, red chairs, pretty lights on the ceiling, along with some ornate decorations. Almost immediately after being seated, the carts started coming around with scrumptious looking dim sum and we started ordering. One of my favorite treats was the pan-fried pork and chive dumpling. This was fried to perfection with an incredibly flavorful and juicy filling of savory, marinated pork with plenty of yummy chives. Sticky rice with Chinese sausage, pork, and mushroom wrapped in lotus leaf was great! Rice was delightfully sticky and the added ingredients were tender and full of seasoning.The Chinese broccoli was also pretty good in a tasty soy sauce blend. The vegetable was a vibrant green color and had just the right crunch and consistency.We also got shrimp and vegetable deep-fried spring rolls which I enjoyed. There was a good amount of flavor and was wonderfully crispy. The small fish that was fried whole was decent as well, though quite salty. I was looking forward to the deep-fried bacon-wrapped shrimp, but it ended up disappointing me. The bacon was fried a tad too much, verging on being burnt and the shrimp was on the bland side. The roast pork steamed buns were just okay. There wasn't a ton of meat filling inside, but the bun was nicely warm and soft. We also got pan-fried turnip cake straight from the grill, but I could already tell that it wasn't brown enough, thus didn't have the crispiness I love. It ended up being too starchy. As for dessert, we tried 3 different treats. The best one was the balls of fried dough that came with condensed milk. The balls of dough had a surprise creamy cool filling and the addition of the condensed milk made it even more delectable. I also liked these glutinous delights that were shaped in a little bunny with a pig in the middle. There were a pinkish-lavender bunny, an orange pig and a white bunny. They had a slight coconut flavor. The sesame balls didn't have red bean filling so I wasn't really a fan.Overall, it was a pretty good meal with a couple of standouts, but overall not up to par to my tastes. The service was all right and the ladies with the carts were nice. However, I would not return.",0
3007,"Title: Mixed Feelings at a Local Dining Spot

I recently dined at a restaurant that came highly recommended by my boyfriend for its inviting appearance. Regrettably, the experience didn't quite live up to our expectations. The biryani, served in an eye-catching pot with bread sealing the top, was a feast for the eyes but fell short on taste. The rice was underdone and the saffron was overpowering, making it hard for me to enjoy the dish.

The eggplant dish also failed to impress—overly spicy and ultimately forgettable, I found myself resorting to mixing its sauce with plain white rice just to temper the heat. Thankfully, dinner concluded on a high note with a delightful carrot halwa dessert that was so good, it inspired me to recreate it at home.

In a neighborhood bustling with dining options, this experience left me wanting. Despite the allure of a beautifully presented meal, the overpowering spices and lackluster flavors have led me to rate this restaurant three stars. It seems more exploration of local eateries is in order before I consider a return visit.",1
17558,"Found this gem on Yelp! Didn't read the reviews; solely choose it based on the food pics. Song E Napole didn't disappoint! Our table of 5 ordered 3 gnocchis. A very simple dish that was quite delicious. I ordered the rigatoni. The meat was super tender and flavorful. My daughter ordered a pizza. The pizza was crazy amazing. The dough was crispy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside. The sauce was very tasty. We ordered dessert too! If you can save room for dessert, order the deep fried Nutella pizza. It was very decadent and comes with a fun surprise!Enjoyed this place thoroughly and would highly recommend. Note.... it's very small so make reservations!",0
16538,"Came for restaurant week lunch. This is one of a few steakhouses in the city that actually offer a steak in their restaurant week menu for lunch without charging extra. Made a reservation a day before for 5 people with no problems.Lobster bisque- decent flavor. I don't drink alot of lobster bisques so not sure if its normal or not but I was hoping for some chunks of lobster but it didnt have any. Seems like the lobster bisques I've tried from different restaurants rarely have lobster meat in them. Anyway, they charge an extra $3 for it which isn't so bad. Tastes better than the onion soup.Rib eye steak ordered medium. I feel like they overcooked the steak. Even my sister's ""medium rare"" looked overcooked. Looked just like mine. The sauce was pretty good, but the texture of the steak was a bit lacking. A bit too dry. Not enough fat or juice. We ordered a side of brussel sprouts. It was a bit too salty. Actually, my cousin complained that the food overall was a bit salty. I somewhat agree.Service was nice and accomodating.Overall, for the price, it's not bad. But I wasn't really crazy about the steak.",0
13972,"Gave Prince another chance on this freezing January day, and by chance I mean ""ate four slices."" ALL were incredible. From the pepperoni slice, to the grandma, to the Sicilian, to the vodka. Everyone of 'em we're unique and tasty and irresistible, confirming the hype that this is one of the greatest pizza spots ever. 5 stars!!!!!",0
1343,"A super nice surprise to find this place! We got here around 5:45PM, and the four of us were seated almost immediately since it was still pretty early. It did get full by around 6 though, so try get there earlier before the dinner rush! You're served some garlic bread sticks once seated which are super delicious and warm. For pasta, you choose your pasta shape, and then the sauce to go with it. I got the rigatoni, alla vodka sauce. The portions are big so I got to take mine home for the next day too. So glad we found this place and looking forward to coming back sometime.",0
18065,"It was 4-star due to the Groupon deal of two tickets for $20 that added to the allure. As it was a quiet Monday night, the service was great as the staff outnumbered the audience.  The food and drinks were good, albeit on the pricier side compared to the pub across the street. However I'm aware I'm paying a premium to eat at a cinema. The quality of the food was much better than the AMC dine-in, but not quite as fancy as the iPic.",0
16488,"I'd like to give this place 3.5 stars, but prefer rather not to round up to 4.Place has a nice atmosphere, the hostess is nice but forgot to give us the menus so that delayed everything a bit. The waiter was...interesting to say the least. Not a man of many words, i think we spoke more than he did. We tried to give him the benefit of doubt, but by the end of the meal, it was just plain ridiculous. Luckily the same group next to us encountered the same problem, so as they say, misery loves company :)We finally got around to ordering after some time waiting for the waiter to show up, we ordered our wine, appetizer, and entrees right away. The buratta and prosciutto was delicious and showed up rather quickly, but where was our bread? We asked for some, and so did the neighboring group. They got oil and vinegar, we sadly did not.We asked again about our wine, since we finished our appetizer already! Then we finally got a glass of chianti and cabernet, not bad!Took about 35 mins for the entrees to come out. My entree was less than spectacular, the rigatoni carbonara. Small portion, tough pasta, bleh. Couldve made it at home. My wife ordered the bucatini amatriciana, actually pretty good! We decided to order the dessert immediately when we got the entrees so we didnt have to wait another hour before the waiter showed up again.However, we had to ask again when the neighboring group asked for dessert. Finally, the tiramisu arrived, check immediately please!We did get complimentary shots of limoncello, nice touch but sugary as hell!All in all, A 2.5 hour meal that shouldve been only 1.5 hours at the most. Words of advice, pay attention to all your tables, dont make then request your presence multiple times, and small talk goes a long way.",0
15633,"Title: Decent Portions, Average Flavors at Noodle Spot

I found my dining experience at this noodle restaurant to be fairly average. While the generous portions of the beef and duck noodles left me satisfied in terms of quantity, the overall flavors failed to leave a lasting impression. The noodles and broth were competently prepared, and there's no denying that the meats were tender and well-seasoned. However, the dishes didn't distinguish themselves from what I might find at any number of similar eateries. If you're after a hearty meal with no frills, this spot might suit you, but don't expect culinary fireworks.",1
2488,"Tea time in NYC has been a beloved ritual for us, and amongst the many we've enjoyed, this delightful spot ranks in our top 3. The food was wonderfully executed without trying too hard to be unique. The selection of four sandwiches offered pleasing variety, with the salmon leading the pack, followed by the classic egg salad, the fresh cucumber, and lastly the satisfying roast beef.

The sweets were a journey in themselves. The pumpkin cake was a standout, reminiscent of carrot cake but with its own twist. The grapefruit cream tart with meringue was unique, definitely catering to a more mature palate, as evidenced by a child's selective tasting. While the pear cream puff and chocolate cake were satisfactory, it was the scones that stole the show; it wouldn't have been a chore to devour ten of them.

Accompanying the assortment of treats was a lovely lemon tea, which was quite enjoyable. However, what truly sets this place apart is its enchanting interior. It's a seamless blend of playful charm and sophisticated design, like a modern twist on your grandmother's house, ready for its social media close-up. Eccentric serving platters and modern light sculptures adorn the walls, all tied together with a striking terra-cotta color that warmly embraces the furniture and decor.

Service was the cherry on top—friendly, attentive, yet unintrusive, striking a perfect balance. Anticipation for a return visit is high, making this tea time experience one to remember and recommend.",1
3590,"Title: A Fair Assessment of Curry at a Middle-of-the-Road Indian Eatery

I recently dined at a local Indian restaurant, which to be honest, falls somewhere between my list of favorites and places I might not visit again. Having an affinity for Indian cuisine, particularly curries, I'm admittedly quite discerning in my tastes.

The naan bread deserves praise for its perfect texture; it was a soft and palatable accompaniment to the meal. For lunch, I opted for the specials – Chicken Tikka Masala and Lamb Tikka Masala. The Chicken Tikka Masala struck a balance between spice and mildness, making it an enjoyable dish with the flavors and chicken quality both hitting the mark.

Unfortunately, the Lamb Tikka Masala didn't measure up. Its texture was passable, but the sweetness was overpowering, ultimately reminiscent of canned tomato soup. The evening’s choice, Butter Chicken, leaned towards the sweeter side and was an average rendition at best. The chicken was disappointingly dry, with a distinctive taste suggesting it wasn't prepared as meticulously as I would hope.

On the brighter side, the service was commendable. The staff was cordial and efficient, ensuring a seamless ordering experience. While this isn't a spot I'm eager to return to, I acknowledge the positive aspects and won't rule out a future visit to explore other non-curry items on the menu, based on the compelling reviews they've garnered.",1
14732,"Wow. Everything we experienced here was unforgettable. From the friendly service to the double cheeseburgers (Add the egg and bacon also, trust me), I couldn't have had a better time at a burger spot. A friend and I came here for an 11am breakfast/brunch and the place was already mostly filled. We didn't have a reservation but luckily there were a few tables open and we were seated right away. Of course we had to order the cheeseburgers (I got the double; she got the single) with bacon and egg on top (at an additional charge). The home fries were crispy and good too! Our water glasses were never empty and the waitresses were so polite. I'm glad this Chicago establishment has finally arrived in NYC and I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone.",0
20483,"I love soba and tried several soba restaurants. I am very happy to find this place in East Village. We dined during lunch hour. They have a lunch box set with a choice of soba or udon. I chose cold soba that came with tempura. Very tasty. It also came with mini salad, broiled salmon, mini chirashi sushi and seasonal vegetable. Very authentic Japanese dishes. After enjoying the lunch box, the server brought dessert. Nice surprise to finish the meal. Would definitely come back again.",0
11879,"I had the pleasure of dining at a local gem where the standout dish was undoubtedly the coca with sobrasada. The spicy red sauce, chorizo chunks, and cheese combination were delectable. The bread's crunch was the perfect contrast to the chorizo's oozy oiliness. The manchego cheese was authentic and delicious, while the goat cheese was dense and rich, albeit a tad heavy.

I also tried a sandwich reminiscent of pork Milanese with tomatoes and cheese – it was good, but the coca sobrasada was superior. The sangria was delightful and paired well with the meal. The patatas con lacón were decent; the lacón tasted wonderful on its own, akin to head cheese which I adore, but the dish lacked a flavor punch when combined with the potatoes, even with paprika and oil.

The pan con tomate could have used a garlic rub to elevate it. As for the jamón ibérico and bellota, they were satisfactory. The churros and dark chocolate sauce were okay; however, if you prefer a milk chocolate taste, it might not be to your liking.

I didn't sample the paella or tortilla de batatas, but the latter looked fluffy and tempting. A note on logistics: the place gets crowded around 8:30 pm, so it's best to visit in a group of four. Employing a strategy where one person secures a table while others grab the food and drinks can ensure a smoother experience.",1

13452,"Title: Cozy Brunch Spot by Columbia University

I recently visited a wonderful brunch locale near Columbia University with three friends and was instantly charmed by the bustling yet welcoming atmosphere. Despite the crowd, we were seated immediately—an impressive feat for a weekend morning.

The highlight of my meal was the Eggs Benedict, modestly priced at $13. The kitchen accommodated my preference for hard yolks, which I greatly appreciated. While I enjoyed the dish overall, the Canadian bacon wasn't quite to my liking, resembling ham more than bacon. Next time, I'm eager to try the Italian sausage option.

Speaking of value, the side options are reasonably priced—adding bacon is just $2, eggs in any style cost $3, and Italian sausage is a mere $3. A special mention goes to the hot apple cider, a steal at $5. It was served with a delightful cinnamon sugar rim that added an extra layer of warmth to the experience.

In conclusion, this spot offers great food at even better prices. The service is friendly and efficient, making it an ideal choice for a satisfying brunch near Columbia.",1
2613,"I wanted to love everything about this pizzeria especially after I took that first bite of my white pizza.  That first bite. That crispy crusted pizza dough.  That wonderful blend of ricotta and mozzarella. That mix of spices and the fresh basil.  All of that was wonderful.  We ordered a small pie 13"", $19!  What! That's really overpriced.  They got the order wrong, even though the waitress was beyond nice and offered to take he pie back. We decided to keep it because we were soooo hungry and didn't want to wait for the pie we actually ordered.  Instead we picked off veggies we didn't want to eat.  The salad we ordered, $11.50 was drenched in dressing and the tomatoes were not fresh, they were old and mushy. The rolls they served were warm and very good.  That helped immediately to take the edge off of our hunger. We arrived midshift as most of the staff were leisurely enjoying a meal in anticipation of the evening rush.   So the place only had a few customers.   The waitress was friendly and gave us plenty of space and time to enjoy our meal.   We appreciated that very much. Seems like we were paying for the legacy of Patsy's since 1933.  I real wages, the dollar was probably worth more than.  I don't I could eat there regularly at those prices, even though I would enjoy every bite of that pizza.",0
11052,"I came here for lunch during Restaurant Week and opted for Three Courses for $32 per person. Even though it was Restaurant Week, I was pleasantly surprised with a solid menu that served variety of dishes. First Course: Grilled Octopus: This was the best octopus I've ever had in NYC. It was extremely flavorful, not salty, and super tender. I was very impressed! Second Course: Salmon Tartare: Although it was fresh, the portion was tiny. It was served with fries, but I wish they gave you less fries and more of the tartare. Dessert: Karydopita--Walnut cake with a scoop of ice cream: This was utterly delicious! I actually finished this dessert. It was not overly sweet but very satisfying. Overall for its price, I think it was definitely worth the visit. Restaurant itself is very fancy and service was excellent. Even though it was noisy and servers were cracking wine glasses here and there, for its value and quality food, I'd highly recommend dining here during Restaurant Week.",0
10334,"Title: A Slice of Flushing's Finest in Manhattan

Having been a fan of their Flushing location, I approached the Manhattan branch of this restaurant with high expectations and I wasn't disappointed, though it couldn't quite capture the original's magic. Despite this, the restaurant's popularity is obvious with its bustling, energetic atmosphere.

The house chicken is a standout - a refreshingly cold and addictive dish that demands a try. The eggplant is skillfully prepared, and while the pork belly's succulent flavors were on point, its excessive fat content did mar the experience somewhat. Leaner cuts would elevate this dish back to its usual excellence.

As for the mapo tofu, spice enthusiasts will be delighted by its fiery kick. It proved a bit too much for my girlfriend, but was spot-on for my palate. Paired with a simple bowl of rice, it's a feast in itself.

The staff keeps pace with the busy environment, providing quick and attentive service that ensures a satisfying dining experience. For those not inclined to venture out to Queens, this Manhattan outpost is a more than worthy alternative for a hearty and flavorful meal.",1
16738,"I loved the cocktails and food here - we ordered classic margaritas, and even still, I tasted the fresh and delicious ingredients used for our drinks. We ordered the buffalo chicken spring rolls and the cauliflower fritters to share, and I was pleased with both. The spring rolls were light, crispy, and tasty, and the fritters were similar to a salmon patty- seasoned really well and topped with a tarter/ mayo cream sauce - which was really interesting and very yummy. This place is great for evening drinks, a quick bite, and a nice atmosphere. The seating is tight and runs out quick so you may want to call ahead for reservations. We got lucky (the second time we went back) and got bar seats.",0
10602,"We came in for restaurant week. The staff here is wonderful,  I was very late for our reservation and they were very friendly and accommodating when I finally arrived. If my review was based on customer service alone then they would get 5 stars, but since my main focus in life is food I had to rate them a 3. We both ordered the carpaccio, tagliatelle bolognese and for dessert the tiramisu and flourless chocolate cake. Perhaps I didn't read the description correctly but in my mind I was expecting the carpaccio to be thin slivers of beef, it was actually a salad with shaved lettuce, parmesan cheese and olives. Once I got over the shock of not seeing any beef, the salad was actually pretty good. The tagliatelle was cooked well but the meat sauce was bland and completely underwhelming. I ended up leaving most of the pasta because I didn't want to waste my time on such mediocre food. I still had high hopes for the desert but one bite of the chocolate cake killed my enthusiasm. The cake was hard and beyond dry. The tiramisu was really good.  Maybe the cook was having a bad day but the food here was disappointing.",0
20582,"Hanoi House is an Alphabet City Vietnamese restaurant. Nothing fancy, simply well made excellent Vietnamese food. As the name implies, this is northern Vietnamese cuisine so don't look for bahn mi sandwiches. Instead, you will be treated to a selection of great Pho. Pho originated early last century in northern Vietnam. Pho spread around the world after the Vietnam War. Hanoi (northern) and Saigon (southern) styles of pho differ by noodle width, sweetness of broth, and choice of herbs. The spring rolls are also very good here.",0
15287,Awesome gluten free pizza and a good size too! Looked around the restaurant and it was the same size as their normal pizzas. They make the crust in house with GF flour from Italy. Crust is thin yet chewy. Their olive oil is amazing as well. Brussel sprouts were delicious and had lots of crispy bacon. Seafood salad was the star. The lemon dressing it's coated in is refreshing and has a nice citrusy punch. Seafood tasted fresh. Would definitely want to come back to try their red pizza. A little pricey but you have to keep in mind you're in NY and this is homemade Gf crust. I've paid $4 upcharge for a Udi's frozen crust so this is a great alternative.,0
12699,"Title: A Birthday Feast at August Gatherings

Our group of six chose August Gatherings to celebrate a birthday, and we were treated to a delightful array of quality Chinese dishes. The standout was the Baked Chicken in salt and pepper – a savory revelation made with cage-free organic chicken, which assured that every poultry dish was delicious. Equally impressive was the nut-encrusted steak paired with papaya, a combination that enhanced the meat's natural flavors exquisitely.

Another gem was the eel clay pot rice, its aroma signifying its specialty status. The Tofu Pot drenched in abalone sauce didn't disappoint either, with King mushrooms that were perfectly battered and fried, adding a satisfying crunch to the smooth tofu.

The meal was not only satisfying in flavor but also in presentation and service. Our server, Frank, exemplified professionalism while maintaining a friendly demeanor. The quick service meant we had more time to enjoy our celebration without unnecessary waiting.

While the homemade ice cream piqued our interest, we had brought our own birthday cake, which may have been why we didn't receive a complimentary dessert – something I noted other reviews mentioned. Nevertheless, the experience was a hit, and the bill, which came to nearly $200 for our group of seniors, was reasonable for the excellent dining experience.

In summary, August Gatherings provided an excellent dining experience with top-notch flavors and service. I'm looking forward to returning on my next New York trip.

11530,"Title: A Magical Concept with Room for Improvement

I recently visited an Alice in Wonderland themed restaurant for an afternoon celebration of my daughter's birthday. Best times to come are post-lunch, after 1:30, or just at opening around 11 to beat the rush. The ambiance was charming, filled with whimsy and nods to the classic tale, setting up a delightful stage for a themed dining experience.

Upon being seated, we were quickly immersed in the theme – my daughter was enamored by the offer of fairy wings, though the alternative of fairy dust (glitter) was not as enchanting for us. My daughter enjoyed the kids' tea time, complete with tasty chicken fingers. I opted for the Tea Time for One, and thanks to our attentive waiter's suggestion, it was ample. The curry chicken salad was decent, though next time I'd be curious to try a different sandwich - it's worth noting for fellow aficionados of high tea that you're limited to a single sandwich choice here.

The buttermilk scone was a highlight, pairing beautifully with the provided jam and butter. However, the experience did have its shortcomings. Service seemed uneven, with a larger party receiving more attention, leading to a moment where I had to request plates for our table. Despite this hiccup, the restaurant's online team deserves commendation for their excellent email communication.

In summary, the concept is endearing and has potential, but the execution could be tweaked to ensure all guests feel equally attended to, and perhaps a more traditional assortment of sandwiches could enhance the tea experience. Worth a visit for the unique theme, but set your expectations just right.",1
2949,"Title: Mixed Feelings at Cozy Eatery During Restaurant Week

I visited this restaurant with my family during Restaurant Week Winter 2020 and left with mixed impressions. The establishment is on the smaller side, leading to a cramped dining experience with seating that could be more comfortable. The single bathroom stall is a clear downside, especially for a full house. Additionally, trying to secure a reservation can be futile through traditional methods; I only succeeded via Resy alerts.

Service fell short of expectations. The staff seemed overwhelmed, and we encountered a particularly unpleasant waitress. However, let's talk about the food, which was a mix of hits and misses:

The persimmon and scallop dish shone, featuring tender scallops and a delectable sauce. We also enjoyed the snow crab pasta; the sauce and pasta were spot-on, though the crab portion was disappointingly scant, possibly due to the Restaurant Week menu.

Dessert was a tale of two treats. The beignets were a standout – hot, crisp, and perfectly complemented by cold ice cream and a variety of sweet accompaniments. The recommended ice cream sandwich creation was a delight. In contrast, the banana tart was a letdown, mushy and unremarkable.

A quirky note: the chef has a heavy hand with breadcrumbs, sprinkling them across all courses, even in the piecrumbs for dessert.

In summary, while some dishes impressed, others didn't, and the overall experience was dampened by logistical and service issues.",1
1653,"Tucked away near Grand Central, this ramen shop is a fine spot to quell those noodle urges on a brisk day. The shoulder-cut pork is on the leaner side – a welcome twist for those of us who prefer less fatty meats. Service is speedy and friendly, contributing to a pleasant dining experience. While the disposable chopsticks could be sturdier, the ample ladle certainly helps you enjoy the flavorful tonkotsu broth to the last drop. The noodles? Perfectly straight and cooked al dente. If you're in the area, definitely worth a stop.",1
15232,"At first glance, this unassuming spot might not catch your eye, but it offers a delightful reprieve for those in search of authentic Arabic fare. Craving a Chicken Shawarma Platter, I opted for convenience with a quick pick-up order. Although a minor hiccup occurred when my initial order was discarded in their commitment to freshness, the staff promptly remade my meal in five minutes.

The Chicken Shawarma itself was a hit – tender, well-seasoned, and generously portioned, albeit paired with a single piece of pita bread, which was disproportionately less for the amount of chicken provided. The hummus and the variety of sauces were delicious accompaniments to the mouth-watering chicken. Despite the pita shortfall, the quality of the food is bound to bring me back for my shawarma fix.

As a token of goodwill, I received a complimentary piece of Baklava. It was a pleasant ending to the meal with its subtle sweetness and flaky texture.

While the mishap with the pickup timing was a wrinkle in the experience, the exceptional quality of the food and the kind gesture of dessert will certainly see me returning to this hidden gem.",1
19463,"Title: A Mixed Experience at a Notable NYC Steakhouse

On my recent trip to NYC, my family and I ventured to try a new steakhouse, having previously enjoyed establishments like Strip House. Booking a table for three, we were keen to dive into the meaty offerings.

However, our dining experience started on a slower note, as we experienced a delay in service, watching two other parties be seated before us despite our reservation. This initial hiccup set a tone that unfortunately carried throughout the evening, with inattentive service such as infrequent water refills.

Once we were attended to, we shared a sumptuous porterhouse steak designed for two but ample enough for our trio. The steak, grilled to a perfect medium, did not disappoint. The lobster bisque starter stood out for its generous portion size and rich flavor. A colossal slice of chocolate cake concluded our meal on a high note, perfectly portioned for shared indulgence.

While the food itself was commendable, the lackluster service did tarnish the overall experience. It's a reminder that even with delicious food, attentive service is a critical ingredient for a truly enjoyable dining experience. Despite my critiques, I can still affirm that this steakhouse serves up quality dishes, but a little more attention to customer care would go a long way.

Rating: 3 out of 5 stars.",1
18751,"Gramercy Tavern has been around for years and somehow continues to be at the top of their game. We came here for dinner and they had a four course pre-fix dinner where you get a few options for each course. Of course being gluten free always makes this challenging since there are less options for each course. However the staff was ready for us, guided us through the menu, made great recommendation and accommodated our restrictions with missing a beat. The gluten-free bread with goat milk butter was better than regular bread. Made glad to be gluten free. The wine recommendation was perfect and complemented our meal well. My wife had beef and I had chicken so that was amazing. The desert was crazy good. My wife had a fantastic cheese plate and I had a flourless chocolate cake with coconut pistachio ice cream that was simply way too good. But the best part was the next morning. Sometimes due to cross contamination or general carelessness with service and ingredients, I feel bloated or worse. But not this time. I woke up feeling great. Gramercy is not cheap, but if you want clean food done right, this is the place.",0
1523,"Title: A Cozy Thai Haven on Frederick Douglass Blvd

After the mental marathon of an exam, I found myself craving the comforting flavors of Thai cuisine and stumbled upon a gem nestled on Frederick Douglass Blvd. The restaurant, exuding warmth and cultural charm, welcomed me—an early weekday afternoon diner—into its cozy embrace.

The friendly staff greeted me promptly, reinforcing the restaurant's homely feel. Eager for a zesty treat, I opted for the spicy Pad Thai, paired with a side salad. The salad was a pleasant starter, featuring tofu doused in a delectable peanut sauce, though it's the Pad Thai that deserves a mention. The noodles were a well-spiced delight, capturing the vibrant essence of Thailand on a plate.

However, my enjoyment was slightly marred by the scant chicken portions within the dish—a personal pet peeve when dining out. It's worth noting that meat-lovers might find the servings a little on the lighter side.

In summary, this establishment serves up a tasty experience, complete with an inviting atmosphere and delightful staff. A slight adjustment to the protein ratios could elevate this already enjoyable meal to new heights.",1
3440,"Didn't have reservations (can make reservations on resy app or call the restaurant) when I arrived.  If you have a big group that is more than 4, you might want to call ahead.Since the place open at 10:30, it was still sort of empty.  I was waiting for a friend to arrive.  So I ordered a dish (Fried Chicken and Three), the bartender gave me a funny look guess it wasn't an item you order at the bar though in my defense I was hungry.  It made me self-conscious enough to ask where a nearby bakery was to get some food to tie me over.Thank goodness when I walk out the door,  my friend arrived.  We sat at a table and had to mention we are awaiting another friend to arrive though we ordered a dish while waiting for the third friend.We ordered:Peach and Burrata with heirloom tomatoes -- this was very refreshingFried Chicken and Three -- the Mac and Cheese was delicious, the cole slaw was simple the way I like it, chicken was delicious and waffles with the syrups was tasty.Shrimp and Grits -- at first I thought it was a bit saucy though the sauce balanced well with the grits.Ordered Arnold Palmer which was perfect in the beginning though one glass was enough since too much became sweet after a while.  Heard the lavender lemonade was sweet though it wasn't in my opinion.  Our server kept our water glasses or drinks filled.There is seating available outside if you want though it was too hot for us on this day.There is one restroom which is comfortablely sized.",0
17291,"First meal in NYC. Our hotel was just one black from Little Italy and Autn Jake's just a short walk away. Who doesn't want pasta on a chilly winter NY night? We were able to make a reservation for the same night, which is always impressive. I could smell the goodness almost immediately. We started off with the beef carpacio and I had their White Margarita which is actually red haha. It was nice. The beef carpacio was tasty and a nice app while you wait for dinner. For dinner I ordered their carbonara on tagliatelle pasta. My husband had their lasagna. They were both amazing and worth a visit back. Great experience in the heart of Little Italy!",0
3311,"Affordable, fresh, and fast, K-Bap serves traditional Korean staples in a small but efficient Midtown kitchen. Seating available for about 20, so don't bring an entourage. Staff are on top of it. Lunch prices are cheaper than dinner.Bimbimbap, soo dou bu soft tofu soups, japchae, and ramen all grace the compact menu here. Everything is made fresh, but quickly. Its possible to dine in and get out in 30 minutes if the kitchen isn't backed up. I had the combination tofu soup and its was hot and savory, the white rice was fresh and fluffy. I would have liked a more toothsome broth, but for the price it was very reasonable. I'm looking forward to trying more items on the menu.Ask for it to be spicy if that's your thing, default is mild.",0
13227,"Title: Casual Ambiance and Ramen Delights Post-Climbing

After a climbing session uptown, my friends N.S., M.Y., and I decided to refuel at this charming restaurant with a casual vibe. The establishment immediately caught our attention with its unique rotary board over the bar, showcasing the specials in an entertaining and dynamic way. It was a nice touch that kept us engaged while we browsed the standard menu.

N.S. and I were tempted by the garlic chicken ramen, and it did not disappoint. The chicken was succulent, imbuing the broth with a delightful blend of garlic and a subtle sweetness. Complemented by fresh green onions, hearty barley noodles, and a rich egg yolk, the dish struck a harmonious balance of flavors. M.Y.'s choice, the spicy beef ramen, was equally appealing, although my preference leaned towards the garlic-infused goodness.

This experience was enjoyable enough to earn a solid 4 stars from me. However, I'm reserving the final star until I've sampled more of their offerings and brought along T.H., a serious ramen enthusiast, for a second opinion. The meal was indeed satisfying, and I have high hopes for my next visit to this culinary gem.",1
1775,"So I am back in school, which leaves little free time. This is where services such as UberEats come into play. One evening, I decided to order some food. I was in the mood for Italian food, and checked out the UberEats app to find my best option. Fumo popped up as a recommendation, and I decided to order pizza.I ordered the Roni pizza, which came with pepperoni, sausage, hot cherry peppers, and mozzarella. The order did not take long to get processed, and the pizza was delivered to my front door in less than 30 minutes. The pizza came at a good temperature, it was warm and just right when it got to me. The pizza was amazing! It was delicious, and the hot peppers were actually spicy! (One of my biggest pet peeves is mild food that is advertised as spicy, I'm glad the people at Fumo were accurate in this detail).This pizza hit the spot. I will consider Fumo the next time I get pizza cravings.",0

The dishes were flavorful and well-prepared, suggesting authentic recipes and fresh ingredients.

It's a place I'd recommend when you're not looking to skimp on either taste or dining comfort.",1
11600,"I've been here multiple times with some vegan (and non vegan) friends, and it's been a hit across the board! I'm not a vegan myself, although I don't eat much meat, but even meat eaters won't believe that all the dishes are animal-free!My go-to dish is the rigatoni - the sauce, which is cashew and porcini mushroom based, is probably better than some non-vegan cream sauces I've had at other restaurants. I'd highly recommend this dish to any and all pasta (especially mushroom pasta) lovers!Also be sure to save room for dessert; the chocolate ganache is amazing, and you won't even be able to tell that the ""ice cream"" accompaniment is dairy-free! Service is usually very friendly - the restaurant itself is cozy, so be sure to make a reservation in advance during prime hours.",0
17105,"Title: A Refreshing Brunch Experience at Rahi

As someone who doesn't typically gravitate towards Indian cuisine, my recent visit to Rahi was an eye-opening delight. Conveniently located near the ACDF trains, Rahi's alluring bottomless brunch option was the catalyst for a meetup with friends.

Upon early arrival, I was immediately impressed by the attentive service at the bar - a refreshing glass of water provided without prompt, a gesture seldom experienced outside the main dining area. Once our group was complete, the staff seamlessly transitioned us to our table.

The ambiance of Rahi deserves mention; the eatery radiates with natural light, complemented by an exquisite selection of Indian artwork that adorns the walls, adding to the dining experience.

The food was a revelation, with my chicken sandwich with egg hitting all the right notes. My friends echoed my sentiments, with satisfaction all around. Rahi is more than just a meal; it's a cultural and culinary journey worth taking, especially if you're in the vicinity.",1
14247,"Cute spot for a small group brunch. Great natural lighting during the day! The chips and Guac were pretty authentic! Not overly salty or citrusy, which is usually what happens with Nyc Mexican restaurants. I got the lamb barbacoa eggs Benedict. Great Mexican spin on a classic brunch item. It's great to have options outside of chilaquiles or huevos rancheros for a Mexican brunch.My friends also had the enchiladas, Chile relleno, and chorizo hash. All very good and just enough when it came to portion sizes.",0

14371,"I've been wanting to come to this steakhouse for such a long time and when my husband said that our friends were making plans for a Sunday couples' brunch here, I was ecstatic! I didn't know what to expect. I wasn't sure if we were going to get the full churrascaria 'meat parade' experience but it didn't matter.When we arrived, everyone was at the bar waiting for us. We were late because parking was a nightmare (see note). We all ordered a cocktail and waited to be seated. I started off with one of their grapefruit gin drinks which I found to be a bit too sweet but I'm sure the bartender could adjust it to your liking. She seemed more than capable and was very knowledgeable about their various available spirits.The place is grand with three floors. There is outdoor seating, coat check and a bar on the main, a dining area below and I believe a second one above. They also have restrooms on each floor. The hostess' were super accommodating. They saw that two of us couples had strollers and small children and asked us if we would prefer a larger table to accommodate the strollers, providing us with enough space where we didn't have to check the strollers and they set up highchairs for us. It's a plus that they have an elevator to the dining area which makes life so much easier. When our table was ready, we were escorted down to be seated and our server immediately approached, took our drink orders and welcomed us to enjoy the salad bar. I really wish I remembered his name because he was soooo helpful during our dining experience. Since we were here for brunch, they also had a waffle and omelet station in addition to the salad bar. There were plenty of greens, rice, beans, cheeses, charcuterie, salads and a soup special on display for our gluttony. I even asked for some chimichurri which I kept plateside, along with some of their pickled onions. We also received the signature mashed potatoes, candied bananas, yuca frites and pao de quiejo (cheese bread), which I love. The meat that we did get to try was amazing. When they finally did come around, I was able to sample their bottom sirloin, filet mignon, lamb, picanha and chicken. I usually find the chicken to be overdone and dried to death two times over but theirs was juicy and thoroughly enjoyable. Since we were a large group at a rectangular table, many of the gouchos seemed to only really go to the end diners and they wouldn't come to the rest of us so we were missing out on cuts of meat as they were flying by. I didn't even know they had lamb chops until someone on the end mentioned it and then I had to personally request that some be brought to me. I know there were at least three or four cuts of meat we didn't even get a chance to try because the gouchos either only went to the two diners on the end or cometely passed our table. I'm not sure if it was because we had the two kids or if it was just that there were so many of us that they didn't even want to bother. Either way it was a bit frustrating because we're paying the same as every other diner in the place, so I expect to receive the same experience. I will say that in my opinion, the best cut of meat is their filet mignon which I normally never order because of its lack of fat but in the case of Fogo, theirs was like butter. It was exceptionally good.I must mention that Jessica (manager?) was so sweet to all of us and very attentive to our needs. She came by often to check in on us, she escorted us up and down the elevator and she got me my lamb chops. Her demeanor, alone, made up for missing out on all the meats. Even our server went above and beyond the call of duty when my beautiful daughter spilled my soup all over the both of us (luckily only my kimono was sauced). It landed in my lap while I was holding her and he was very helpful in assisting me with tons upon tons of napkins and a paper bag for my soupy kimono. He didn't miss a beat and he kept asking if there was anything he could do. I could see on his face that he felt my pain and he was trying to do all he could to help make this little snag remain nothing more than that.I definitely want to come back here but we might have to leave the baby with my parents so we can enjoy the full dining experience without leaving the restaurant wearing any of our meal. Also, I think I'll be asking about the meats they offer before we even order our drinks so that I can request the specific cuts I would like to try. NOTE (as of 8/04/19): Even on a Sunday parking right now in the area is atrocious. There are many restrictions due to construction so make sure you read the signage because the construction signs supercede the regular daily signage and we narrowly missed getting what was sure to be a hefty ticket.",0
14961,"Upon a friend's recommendation, I visited this local restaurant on a Sunday evening, managing to snag a reservation with just a few hours notice. The establishment had a cute and warm ambiance, setting the stage for an anticipated enjoyable dining experience. Unfortunately, the service significantly marred my overall impression, leading me to downgrade my rating by 2 to 3 stars, landing it closer to a one-star rating if judged solely on service.

We ordered various pasta dishes and roasted chicken. Our meals trickled out in an untimely fashion; the first two dishes arrived with some promptness, but the others lagged behind without explanation or a visible waiter to inquire about the delay. Eventually, all dishes made it to our table, with the chicken and baked mashed potatoes being sizeable and tasty and the pasta portions decent.

Dessert was a letdown not because of the Nutella-based treat itself, which is usually a safe bet but due to service issues once again. The dessert was served without plates, and after struggling to catch the attention of the staff, we were presented with dirty plates, requiring another wait for clean ones. By this point, the dessert had cooled down.

The food was good, but not exceptional enough to compensate for the subpar service. It's with disappointment that I cannot recommend this restaurant based on this experience; the service was well below the expected standard and profoundly affected our enjoyment of the meal.",1

1458,"I came in on a weekday early for lunch and the place was not too crowded. The waitress sat me down at the counter and kindly explained the process to me. I appreciated that the placemat had instructions on it, too.I ordered the Premium Hamburger Steak. As a huge fan of Japanese food, and Japanese food inspired by Western food, the Hamburger Steak (or Hamburg Steak as some places in Japan call it) was something I was really craving when I saw it on the menu.I really love how it comes sizzling to your table with the steak and veggies/sides in the same cast-iron. It's an image I see a lot associated with restaurant cuisine in Japan, and I love being able to experience it here in New York. The placemat said that steaks arrive blue-rare or rare for you to cook them, but the hamburger steak arrives around medium-rare. This is probably smart because hamburgers should be cooked more thoroughly than your traditional steak.Still, I followed the rules and spread the garlic paste, flipped the pieces over a bed of rice when I thought it was done cooking (only a minute max for hamburger steak as it arrives cooked already), and poured the accompanying sauce on it.Let me say: it was JUICY and PEPPERY! I love the punch of flavor you get on first bite, and the crunch you get from the parts touching the cast-iron. What a delight. And it was a good portion for me to take some back for my roommate to try as well!Some of the other reviews mention that the restaurant is standing-only and you have to stand to eat... did I miss the memo? I observed other customers sitting at the bar or tables as well.",0

If you're prowling through midtown Manhattan in search of the ultimate pastrami sandwich, look no further—I've found your haven. Not only does this gem boast the best pastrami in the area, but it's also a delight for my Muslim friends since everything here is kosher.

Don't let the prices deter you; the sandwiches might hit the wallet a bit harder, but they hit the spot even more so. Generous portions ensure you won't leave hungry, and with the complimentary bowl of their signature cold-slaw and pickles, you're in for a full-fledged meal that's absolutely worth every penny.

Take my advice and elevate your sandwich experience by asking for the Russian dressing. It's a tastebud revelation and complements the sandwiches perfectly. And if you're a mustard aficionado, prepare to be impressed—you'll find their mustard equally amazing.

This spot has become my absolute go-to for not just pastrami, but also for a delectable roast beef sandwich. Trust me, it's a must-try!",1

13515,"Tucked away in mid-town lies a truly historical gem of a restaurant, offering a transportive experience that begins the moment one steps through its doors. With its high ceilings and otherworldly bar, the ambiance hearkens back to a different era, perfect for dining before a show, thanks to a thoughtfully curated pre-theater menu.

While the overall food quality impresses with its freshness, it's wise to steer clear of the beet salad, which unfortunately falls flat in terms of flavor. On the other hand, the cocktail selection stands out – particularly those with an added smoky element that introduces intricate layers to each sip.

Dessert does not disappoint, with the earl grey tea crème brûlée ending the meal on a delightful note. Don't forget to take in the decorative melted candles, adding to the charm and story of this inviting historical space.",1

My dining experience during Restaurant Week at this spot was memorable, to say the least. The restaurant truly embraced the spirit of the week, offering a genuine selection of dishes from their main menu.

For mains, the roast chicken was succulent and brimming with flavor, while the salmon stood out with its mouth-watering sauce and a side of perfectly roasted eggplant. The desserts, although not as stunning as the preceding courses, were still quite satisfying.

But the highlight wasn't just the food – it was the exceptional service. The wait staff offered a warmth and friendliness that elevated the meal further. Our waiter, with his constant smile and excellent recommendations, provided a level of service that is a rarity in NYC.

12609,"After dining at Neta on two separate occasions, I found the food quality to be quite good, however, the overall experience didn't fully meet my expectations. The menu, which predominantly features sushi and a few small starters, lacks variety and doesn't offer any sets or poke bowls, which was somewhat disappointing. While the service was passable, it didn't particularly enhance the dining experience. Value for money was a concern as well; my meals exceeded $50 and yet, I left feeling slightly unsatisfied in terms of portion sizes. If you're in search of premium sushi and don't mind a narrower selection with a higher price tag, Neta could be an option, but be prepared for the possibility of needing a snack later on.",1

However, the Scottish Salmon served with carrots and a honey glaze provided a pleasantly flavorful alternative to the beef.

But let’s not overshadow the pork broth – a spectacular concoction that I could joyfully slurp down on its own, no accompaniments necessary. The broth’s depth of flavor alone is a testament to the kitchen’s mastery. 

My visit was a great experience through and through, leaving no question as to why this establishment has earned its Michelin star.",1
16580,"I discovered this hole-in-the-Wall Italian spot from a good app that I use, and I am so glad that I did! Tiella is a small, cozy, intimate restaurant on First Ave just north of the Queensboro Bridge.This is real, authentic Italian food with big portions. It is frequented by locals due to its being nestled on a street that doesn't see much foot traffic.We started by splitting a bottle of Cab, which was fairly good. Then, we ordered the 12"" portion of the truffle pizza, which was to die for!!! Apparently any of the pizzas can be made in a 6"" or 12"" size. That truffle pizza was one of the best I have ever tried, and I wasn't expecting to like it much at all (I'm more of a red-sauce-on-my-pizza kinda gal). The 12"" size was perfect for 3 people- I got one slice and the 2 boys I were with split the last one. They slice it so the slices are big.For mains, I got the classic spaghetti. I usually don't get that anywhere and would have gotten the seafood pasta, but the waiter told me that it was made with broth, and I prefer sauce to broth. My friend got the seafood pasta, and my other friend got the lasagna. Portions were huge! Needless to say, none of us could finish, but we had some nice leftovers for lunch the next day.My spaghetti was delicious. It was a simple, classic dish that many screw up, but this was really great and is something that I would order again. There were a ton of tomatoes, just the right amount of sauce, and the pasta was cooked perfectly.I tried the seafood pasta dish that my friend ordered, and it was delicious too! The sauce wasn't really a broth like the waiter had said, but it wasn't a thick sauce either. I would have ordered it if I knew that's what it would be.I didn't try the lasagna, but my friend said that it was excellent.Overall, Tiella was fantastic, and it's a place that I will definitively be frequenting. If you live in Lenox Hill, this should be your new go-to spot!",0
15861,"Title: A Melty Delight in Union Square

I recently visited the Melt Shop in Union Square and was impressed with their extensive sandwich selection. The menu boasts a tempting range of chicken melts, burger melts, signature creations, and classic grilled cheese sandwiches. I opted for a burger melt accompanied by shop tots—both were delectable. The bread was grilled to perfection, and the cheese lived up to the restaurant's namesake by being deliciously melted. The tots, dusted with parmesan, were a crunchy delight.

While the place is cozy and seating is at a premium, it seems most patrons prefer to take their food for an al fresco experience in the park or enjoy it at home. I'm already planning my next visit to try some of their limited-time offerings, like the intriguing Mike's Hot Honey Melt and the Smoked Brisket and Chimichurri Melt. If you're in the mood for a comforting, cheese-laden meal, Melt Shop is a must-try.",1

The dish I received boasted perfectly cooked eggs, succulent chicken, and a green sauce with just the right amount of kick, transporting me back to the flavors I savored in Merida. What set Lupita's apart was the freshness and the robust taste of their food. It's not every day you find such authentic Mexican cuisine in the Big Apple. For anyone harboring a chilaquiles craving, Lupita's is the place to go. Highly recommended!",1

For instance, we had three people and we ordered two sets of afternoon tea plus $30 sharing fee. Foods are okay and teas are good. Everything was not bad, but the reason I took two starts off on this review is because our server was checking the tips amount in front of us when we gave over 18% rounded amount, which was not high class at all.Note: Be careful on your check. For example, we ordered a champagne tea set without champagne, and the check came with the price with champagne.",0
16136,"Nestled within the charming vintage facade of one of New York’s older establishments, our dining experience certainly lived up to the restaurant's timeless appeal. Despite the inevitable 30-minute wait due to its popularity, every moment spent in anticipation was rewarded.

The meal commenced with light and fluffy breadsticks that set our taste buds alight, paving the way for the true stars of the evening: the pizzas. We opted for a white, no-sauce pizza adorned with peppers, olives, and spinach, as well as a classic Margherita, both personalized with additional toppings. Each 12-inch medium pizza, segmented into six generous slices, exuded an aroma that beckoned us to indulge.

The sight of slightly charred ricotta, kissed by a flame torch atop the no-sauce pizza, was nothing short of a masterpiece. But it was the explosive harmony of flavors—zesty olives, aromatic garlic spinach, and the subtle tang of ricotta—that commanded our full attention, silencing our table until the very last bite. Indeed, this dining experience was a delicious testament to the notion that good things come to those who wait.",1

For entree, we got the Classic Shakshuka. We do feel it could have been better with a bit more of spice to it. Lastly, for desserts we got the Kitchen Kadaif. This is a must try. It looks beautiful and tastes amazing.",0
19447,"I have been here a few times for brunch with friends and the food is pretty good for the price. The prices are relatively cheap for the city. I have gotten their Eggs Benedict, Beef Burger, French Toast and Waffles. I normally prefer to order eggs at a brunch place, but I think that Cornerstone's sweet breakfast foods like the waffles and French Toast are more worth it than their eggs. Also I would highly recommend getting breakfast over lunch at Cornerstone. The burger I had was okay but not anything amazing. The restaurant has cool decorations that makes the atmosphere better and the staff there are pretty friendly. Just something to keep in mind when going, there is a 3% fee for people who pay the bill with credit cards so have some cash on hand before going.",0
13482,"Went to Mama Fina's for the first time and we weren't disappointed! The food was amazing and authentic (that's a must for me, being Filipino!). We ordered the crispy pata, it was so tender and crispy in the right places! We also ordered the Pusit Sisig, which was really tasty. The Pork Sisig was also tasty but I preferred the Pusit. For dessert, we had turon which were also really good. The service was also pretty good. You order at the counter and food is served at your table. It's basic, don't expect white glove service, it's not that kind of restaurant. If you're looking for great Filipino food though, this place is worth checking out!I'd go back to Mama Fina's again in a heartbeat!",0

Asian fried rice was surely in the running but the winner of the evening was the dessert-Crying chocolate'  and if there is something called foodgasm, I think we went through it.. Absolutely loved this place.. surely lived up to it's hype",0
1858,"Went for an early dinner at 5p and found myself being the only customer and sitting next to a table of staff having their work dinner. Ha.Like what other reviews have pointed out, the skewers here though properly grilled were a bit underseasoned, a surprising letdown for a self-proclaimed northeastern style Chinese grill restaurant. I tried grilled eggplant, lamb, and pig trotters and found all of them a bit lacking in seasoning and flavor. The only dish I found relatively better seasoned was  Copper Pot Frogs . It was a bit of a rare find even in NYC and was the reason why I visited this place. The frogs came out in a traditional Chinese copper hot pot, nicely diced, sauteed, and packs a pleasant kick. I overheard from the restaurant people that the pickled pepper style frogs are even better. Wish I had asked for their recommendations!",0
10772,"Title: A Gastronomic Field Trip Not to be Missed

My recent visit to this gem of a restaurant was nothing short of delightful, with a menu that boasts a must-try list guaranteed to satisfy. The Braised Beef Rice Bowl was the star of the meal, striking the perfect balance between hearty and flavorsome, with tender meat that simply melted in the mouth. Pair this with their unique Crab Pockets, which offer a playful twist on traditional wontons, complemented by a tangy sweet and sour sauce for dipping.

Adding to the culinary adventure were the Yucca Puffs – a textural surprise similar to shrimp chips yet flavored with a subtle, sweet potato essence. But let’s talk about refreshments: the Dragonfruit Lemonade was the epitome of thirst-quenching, with its vibrant hues and the perfect blend of sweet and tart.

Service? Impeccable. The staff were not only attentive but brought a sense of fun to the dining experience, bidding us farewell with a catchy “see you on your next field trip,” a line that's sure to linger with you as much as the flavors.

And for those seeking a spirited layer to their meal, the restaurant serves alcohol; I’ve got my eye on the Lucky Dog Sake for next time. All in all, this eatery gets my high recommendation for a fulfilling and memorable dining 'field trip.'",1
20211,"Yay, they are in TriBeCa!  Fast, cheap good and spicy. To some, that is a dream date. What more can you want? I had the carne asada taco, with corn tortilla. Flavorful and nice steak. The most bang for the buck I can get in this neighborhood. As in their other location, there is no seating with only standup counter space. Go and have your food in the park. Yummy.",0
16590,"I recently had the pleasure of indulging in the Kaiseki set at this gem of a restaurant and I must say, it was a delightful culinary journey filled with surprises. The Zensai course— an assortment of appetizers— was a standout, with each small dish presenting a burst of flavor, but the Oyster Leaf truly stole the show with its remarkable ability to mirror the taste of an actual oyster.

The Lobster Shabu Shabu was not only a fun interactive experience, but the freshness of the lobster was evident with each succulent, perfectly cooked bite following a brief 5-second swirl in the broth. It was, without a doubt, the highlight of the meal.

This spot comes highly recommended for a romantic date night or a lively dinner with friends. The Kaiseki set is a must-try for an unforgettable dining experience.",1
10329,If I have to choose a restaurant for Indian takeout night it will always be @cholanyc  I celebrated my convocation today with my favorite Indian dishes - Malai Kofta and black daal!We ordered the Black Daal (Dal Malai Marke); Malai Kofta; Laccha paratha (layered flatbread made of whole-wheat and flour) and Garlic NaanPs: I always love that they give an extra side of the black daal with my order.. Makes me feel like a little girl getting an extra chocolate for good behavior Also this place has the best Malai Kofta in town!,0
18630,"What an authentic dining experience!I am by no means a sushi connoisseur, but even I was able to tell that Hatsuhana's fish was nothing short of amazing and the friend I dined with was able to attest to this. The ambience is perfect for either a date or an intimate family/friend gathering. Our server was also very polite and patient, giving us suggestions of what to order and explaining the dishes when served. We ordered the ever-popular box of dreams and the sashimi deluxe. The box was surely what dreams are made of and if you are someone who likes to share food at every meal, this would be a great choice. There were enough pieces per selection for my friend and I to both try. The sashimi deluxe came with 8 chef-selected nigiri and a roll of our choice- we got yellowtail. After stuffing our faces with fish and rice, we chose to order the icecream sandwich. The 'bread' of the sandwich was, light and crispy, reminiscent of a soft serve cone, serving as a vessel for the matcha icecream and a red bean topping. It also came with a side of 2 matcha mochis.I would HIGHLY recommend this place for a great night of sushi and if you want to impress your friends with your delectable taste in Japanese cuisine :) It was totally affordable and worth every $.",0
3522,"It's the dive bar you never knew you needed. It's loud. It's crowded. But everyone that's here comes back here over and over again. It's not a huge spot but has a full bar with seating including tables and chairs. The owner is fun and friendly and has a habit of sharing his love for Jameson with his patrons. I've partaking in a complimentary shot or two. And though he may not know my name he acknowledges me and the fact that I am a recurring customer whenever I stop in.I've had their lobster special. It's good! I also had the sauteed bok choy. Delish. This place doesn't look like much but the good is great. The drinks are strong. The company is lively.

11882,"Fried chicken and Mac&cheese that does catering. Ordered this in for both an office Thanksgiving lunch party and for a post-office holiday party lunch. The delivery guy was very friendly and the food items were packed in boxes so you don't really need that many people to pick up the food. The chicken tenders taste real good after a night of drinking. Some pieces are a tad dry and I wish there would be more breading, but you could also put them in a biscuit for a sandwich. There's different sauces but my favorite is the BBQ one. It's not that sweet and goes well alongside the mac & cheese. The mac & cheese is the best part - I like the crust on top which has a nice crisp bite. The salad is also surprisingly good - I like the farmhouse dressing it comes with. ( Note that some people may find that the salad has too many onions). Overall it's a solid spot to get some lunch catered when you're trying to indulge in the holidays.",0
13184,"On a spontaneous Wednesday evening visit, we were immediately seated at this unpretentious yet cozy eatery. Despite its compact dimensions, the establishment gives off an accommodating vibe for larger parties with prior reservations. The broad menu selection is complemented by reasonably priced wines. Our starters, mussels and clams, arrived in generous servings but fell short on freshness. However, the squid ink pasta I ordered was a savory delight, boasting a generous portion of seafood. The staff was notably amicable, enhancing the dining experience. Overall, a commendable choice for those in search of Italian cuisine.",1

12158,"Title: Sunday Funday Success at East Harlem Brunch Spot

My friends and I decided to indulge in a bottomless mimosa brunch at a cozy spot in East Harlem last Sunday. At 1 PM, the place was pleasantly uncrowded, allowing us to be seated immediately—a great start to our laid-back meal.

For $14.95 per person, the one-hour mimosa deal seemed like a steal, and we were on a mission to get our money's worth. Our server was quick to jump in with his efficient service, taking our eager order and keeping up with our enthusiastic pace by refilling our glasses without hesitation. He even gave us a heads-up as our time limit approached to ensure we got one last round—talk about thoughtful service!

The food certainly matched up to the impressive drinks service. My pasta had the perfect bite, embracing the sauce in the most satisfying way, while the seafood mixed in, including tender squid, was expertly cooked—a rarity in many establishments. On the other side of the table, my boyfriend's salmon eggs Benedict hit all the right notes with its fresh flavor, balanced saltiness, and that dreamy runny egg.

This brunch spot is a gem in East Harlem, and we're already planning our next visit. If you're in the area and craving a boozy brunch with top-notch food and service, look no further.",1
18723,"I had the pleasure of dining at a new Japanese restaurant that had caught my eye since its opening. The chilly evening was quickly forgotten the moment we received a warm, welcoming smile from a manager (?) upon entering. The gesture of hot towels for hand-cleaning was a touch of traditional Japanese hospitality I deeply appreciate.

We indulged in the Kai Course, a five-course menu that commenced with an exquisitely plated appetizer—both visually stunning and gastronomically delightful. The second course, a ""Daily Special"" of sushi and sashimi, was remarkable for its freshness; every piece was buttery and simply melted in the mouth.

The third course introduced us to Chicken Hoba Yaki, an impressively presented grill dish using a magnolia leaf, blending tender chicken and well-cooked vegetables with a delectable miso flavor. The fourth course surprised us with a sophisticated take on Ramen, which surpassed expectations for elegance in an upscale setting.

Dessert was a trio of mizu yokan, offering a tasting journey from traditional to innovative with Chestnut and Chocolate Yokan varieties. Concluding the meal, another set of hot towels was provided, a testament to their impeccable service. The waitstaff were polite and knowledgeable, enriching our dining experience.

The combination of high-quality ingredients, artistic presentation, and harmonious flavors ensures my eagerness to return for more of this delightful Japanese cuisine.",1
17241,"Title: Unrivaled Ramen Excellence in NY

If you consider yourself a ramen aficionado, prepare to have your standards skyrocketed. This spot isn't just good – it's the pinnacle of ramen in New York.

The ambiance sets the stage for a memorable dining experience, enveloping you in an inviting warmth you'll want to return to. Be warned, though; such exceptional food comes with its wait time. Anticipation is part of the journey here.

The real star is the ramen itself. Noodles possess an almost magical quality: bouncy, effortlessly chewable, and exquisitely slippery – each mouthful is akin to a harmonious dance of textures. But let’s talk about the broth – it’s a pristine concoction of flavors that leaves no unwanted aftertaste and won't weigh you down. Satisfied, not stuffed – that’s the feeling you’ll cherish.

This isn’t just food; each sip and bite plays a melodious symphony of flavors that’s unforgettable. It’s a trifecta of superior quality noodles, soup, and overall execution. So, yes, best ramen in NY? It's right here. Bam.",1

I recently dined at this charming restaurant in NYC and was thoroughly impressed. The ambiance is enriched by captivating artwork—so much so that my son leaning on a particularly cheeky piece became a humorous highlight of our visit. The attentive staff ensured we were seated immediately, enhancing the welcoming atmosphere.

The culinary experience was delightful; every dish we sampled was a testament to the kitchen's prowess. While not a local, I'd frequent this establishment more if the distance allowed. Nonetheless, it has secured a spot on my list of top recommendations for anyone visiting the city. Do yourself a favor and savor a meal here!",1
2938,"I'm starting off with my complaint about the service because otherwise I would've given this place 5 stars. And I didn't give three stars because I want people to know the food is good. I hope the issue resolvesI'm really not one to normally complain, but some of the workers I came across seemed very uninterested and not on top of things. I ordered the rice plate and the pita and by the time I had done toppings they lost my plate and i was about to only leave with my pita. By lost my plate I mean a few more people came in (and it wasn't crowded at the time at all for a place in the city) and it was apparently difficult I was ordering two different things?? That they didn't push the bowl down 10 inches so I can just put stuff on. Anyway, by the time I got to the cashier he was a whole mess and I actually got TICKED OFF. He was talking to another worker casually behind him and totally disregarding me. He saw the pita was in front of me and he typed that in the order and gave me the price. I was like wait I have a rice bowl, and he went back to his convo. And I had to ask the other girl who helped me. And then I got the rice bowl and he gave me the price and I was like wait can I get a drink and he was like ""you can get whateverrrr you want"" in a semi sarcastic tone? I felt like he was trying to shoo me off? Instead of asking me if there was anything else I'd Like because I actually Wanted to get something else. And I tried to ask a question because I didn't know what size he put down when he told the price for the third time. So i just took the bigger cup because I had no clue. I was gonna get pita and hummus as well as a dessert but instead I just finished the order because I didn't want to hold up the line as more people were behind me and have them get more confused. I didn't buy more because he made me just want to get out of there. And that's not good for Roti's business because the food they have is really good.This is like Mediterranean Chipotle. It's also much better than I anticipated. I really enjoyed it. I got the classic pita and the classic rice plate. I also tried the falafel and spicy lamb meatballs. The options are pretty healthy and it's a nice spot for a quick lunch. The seating is pretty generous too. I loved the falafel because of how crispy it was on the inside and how thick the chickpea was. The chicken in both the pita and the plate were delicious. I believe it was Roti and kebab. The sauces were all yummy too. Everything tasted fresh, especially the veggies. The only thing I didn't care for much was the lamb meatball, maybe I'm just not big on lamb that's why.",0
10544,Came here for a women empowerment brunch & the layout of this restaurant is nice. Spacious bar & dining area & they had a DJ too. I ordered the steak & eggs w potatoes which was fine.

12229,"Title: Taco Triumph in the Heart of NYC

I cannot sing enough praises for what I can confidently declare are my favorite tacos in New York City. My latest visit to the Big Apple included a remarkable three stops at this temple of taste—it's just that irresistible. The Adobada tacos are my personal holy grail, though truthfully, it's impossible to make a misstep with any selection from their menu.

What truly sets these tacos apart are the handcrafted tortillas, the impeccably fresh and savory meats, and the harmonious salsas. The red salsa, while delicious, does pack some heat, so consider enjoying it on the side if your spice tolerance is modest.

With several locations scattered around the city, you're never too far from taco nirvana. Don't miss out on this culinary cornerstone; it's a must for any taco aficionado in NYC.",1
19016,"Title: Hidden Gem Delight: A Night at Sakagura

Last week, after a tiresome day of conferences, my colleagues and I ventured to Sakagura for dinner based on a recommendation. Tucked away in the basement of what appears to be just another office building at 211 E 43rd St, this Japanese dining spot was a surprising find.

Despite not having reservations on a busy Friday night, we were seated within a commendable 30-minute wait. The contrast between the building’s office vibe and Sakagura’s inviting Japanese decor was striking. The atmosphere was warm and welcoming, embodying a subtle nod to Japan without overdoing it.

Sakagura's extensive sake selection impressed us as we sampled several varieties, complemented by a pleasantly sweet plum wine. We opted for a communal dining experience, sharing a spread of small plates including peppers, chicken meatballs, tuna, cold noodles, fried chicken, squid, grilled calamari, and a DIY sushi rice dish. Each plate was a fresh culinary adventure, pushing the boundaries of my usual tastes but ultimately leaving me satisfied.

We capped off our meal with black sesame crème brûlée and matcha cheesecake, both of which struck a perfect balance of sweetness and provided a delightful end to our dining experience.

Service was impeccable throughout the evening, with attentive staff and well-timed dish presentation. Overall, Sakagura is a noteworthy spot that I'm glad to have visited. While I'm not in a hurry to return, it's certainly a place I'd recommend for anyone looking to explore Japanese cuisine in an unexpected corner of the city.",1
10450,"Title: A Manhattan Gem Not to Be Missed!

If you're ever in Manhattan, especially during the bustling holiday season, make your way to this delightful spot! Our experience was impeccable from the get-go with bar seating snagged on a busy Saturday night – a tough find in the city.

The bartender was an absolute gem; her warm and attentive service added a special touch to our evening. She recommended fantastic dishes without missing a beat. The Osaka style spicy tuna was a hit at our table, bursting with flavor and spice that tantalized our taste buds. As for my Thai steak and noodle salad, cooked perfectly to a medium rare, it was so delightful that my husband couldn't resist sneaking bites from my plate. Speaking of my husband, he indulged in the famous French dip, and it was a triumph – thick, juicy roast beef with scrumptious homemade coleslaw that left us all nodding in approval.

A word to the wise: bar seating operates on a first-come, first-served basis, and trust me, you'll want to snag those seats. For those preferring a more traditional dining experience, book your reservations early; this place is a hot commodity.

In summary, this restaurant is a must-visit – you simply can't go wrong with any choice here. Cheers to delightful dishes and stellar service!",1
14297,"Came here early on a Sunday night, easily were seated upstairs in the BBQ section. They are quite bustling and quick with their service. It's pretty clear that they're used to having to move people in and out as quickly as possible. We ordered the BBQ Combo for 2 which included Marinated Beef Short Rib, Marinated Beef Prime Ribeye, Marinated Pork Ribs/Spicy Pork BBQ+ Stew. I believe the combo was around $75. The dish came with a number of sides and the meat was prepared for us (the waittress will put it on your grill and cook it - you don't do anything). The meat was delicious, but the sides were not too impressive and were clearly taken from large batches. Overall, reasonable Korean BBQ but I felt rushed through the meal. And considering how many other good Korean restaurant's there are in this area I don't think this one is particularly memorable .",0
15292,"Very friendly bartenders. Quaint atmosphere. I came in with a group of four, I only had a few beers and some Irish whiskey, but the food looked really good. Next time I'm around, I'll have to order something to eat.",0

20939,"Disclaimer- Yes, this is for the burger. Yes, I gave it 4 stars versus the 3 stars I feel most people would lean towards because l I love salt (blame genetics)? and blue cheese but if you're not a fan of either of those, you're going to literally hate this burger. Also, the shoestring fries definitely aren't for everyone but since I manage to eat about 20 per bite and love rosemary/garlic, they were A-ok with me.My friend and I stopped by on a Tuesday a little after 5:30 and were seated immediately downstairs, both of us getting the ""booth seats"" (what I like to call the comfy seats). The decor is super cute and follows the theme so to speak with a lot of porcelain spotted pigs on walls' shelves. Of course, we ordered the burger medium rare. It took an unexpectedly long time but then again, we weren't starving and sometimes good things require patience! I also noted that it took roughly 20-25 minutes for everyone but again, I'm not a chef so I can't complain.Now, the burger. As mentioned before, it's definitely not for everyone. Blue cheese is a lot more pungent than most cheeses like mozzarella and provolone to start. This burger is also much saltier than most but not because of the actual party itself and instead more so the blue cheese and the fries. However, me being me, I enjoyed it but I can easily see the burger ""throwing people off"" so to speak- it's a love or hate thing and you won't know till you try it.",0
1282,"Title: A Hidden Gem: Au Cheval NYC

I recently had the pleasure of dining at the newly opened Au Cheval in New York City, a spot I adored in Chicago. My fiancé and I eagerly made reservations for a Friday lunch and were not disappointed.

Tucked away in an unassuming alley, Au Cheval NYC offers a speakeasy-esque vibe, providing a charming escape from the urban hustle. Greeted by a hospitable host who graciously offered to stow our luggage, the service from the outset was impeccable.

Despite our early arrival, we were seated immediately and attended to by a considerate waiter. We indulged in cold brew beverages – black tea for me and coffee for my partner – both hitting the mark.

Our order was ambitious: two single burgers with added egg and bacon, duck heart gravy hash, bone marrow, and a side of bacon. Each burger was a masterpiece, striking the perfect balance of flavors with succulent bacon amplifying the taste without overpowering with saltiness.

The duck hash was satisfactory, albeit the heaviest dish on the table. In contrast, the bone marrow stole the show with its crusty topping and delicate sea salt – so delectable that the accompanying jam went untouched.

The ambiance of Au Cheval NYC is refined and relaxed, surpassing its Chicago counterpart. The highlight without a doubt was the burger – an unforgettable combination when paired with egg and bacon.

In summary, Au Cheval NYC has nailed it once again. From the atmosphere to the service and the exquisite food, it’s a must-visit for any burger connoisseur. I'm counting down the days until I can return.",1
2386,"Title: Cozy Space, Great Eats at La Contenta

My recent visit to La Contenta can be described as a culinary adventure in a cozy setting. While the restaurant is a charming gem, its compact size is notable. As someone with a petite frame, I still found the proximity of the tables slightly uncomfortable. Those with a preference for more personal space or who are prone to grand gestures while conversing might find the closeness a bit much. Additionally, the bathroom is exceptionally small, so it might be wise to plan accordingly.

Culinary-wise, the menu is tantalizing. I opted for the fish tacos, which were a delightful mixture of catfish, avocado, cole slaw, and a zesty chipotle aioli, accompanied by a hearty serving of refried beans and rice with vegetables. Unfortunately, my initial serving was marred by an unwelcome hair in the taco. However, the staff handled the situation with prompt professionalism, replacing my meal and going a step further to offer a complimentary flan as an apology, which was much appreciated.

In conclusion, La Contenta serves up delectable dishes in a snug setting. If you can overlook the spatial challenges, your taste buds are in for a treat.",1
14557,"Title: Satisfying Takeout with Room for Improvement on Portion Size

I recently opted for takeout from this local spot and my overall experience was quite positive. The fried rice stands out not only in taste but also in its generous portion, easily serving two with leftovers to spare. The sticky rice, packed with a savory mushroom filling, was truly flavorful, although it did have a tendency to cling to the leaves more than I'd prefer.

The chicken dumplings and spicy wontons were the highlights, boasting a freshness and flavor that left me wanting more. Absolutely a must-try and on my list for the next order. The roast duck soup noodles were thoughtfully packaged, with the broth served separately to maintain the perfect noodle texture. The duck itself was tender, beautifully complemented by a flawlessly medium-cooked egg.

The only shortcoming was the size of some portions, which seemed small relative to the price, but the quality of the food compels me to return. This place is definitely on my radar for a repeat visit.",1
13300,"Came here for restaurant week, and it was $42 per person for dinner. This was one of the best restaurant week deals I have seen. For reference, the 10 oz filet mignon is normally $44. On top of that, you're also getting an appetizer, side, and dessert. I had so much food I felt like exploding.Steak Tartare: My first time having this. It was wonderfully tender and well seasoned. It had the perfect amount of acidity to balance the taste. The egg on top was smooth and brought the textures together. The crisped waffle fries were good, too.Calamari: Crispy on the outside, tender on the inside. Sauce had a nice kick.Mac & Cheese: Delicious crust of bread crumbs on top. Standard mac & cheese underneath. Satisfied with this side nonetheless!Garlic Fries: Flavor is a little muted, would have preferred a bolder sauce or something to add some oomph.Filet Mignon (10 oz): Wonderfully seared crust on the outside, tender on the inside. Profiteroles: Crunchy and not too sweet! The insides were a little lacking in cream.Tiramisu: Pretty good, not the best I've had.To summarize, all the food was pretty good. Not amazing, but definitely good and I am VERY satisfied with this restaurant week deal. The steak and steak tartare were probably my favorite dishes.",0

11839,We rarely come into town but when we do we are always with a large group and if I were to be happy with one thing it would be that they were able to accommodate us ... after that it was w downhill disaster .... i could write a list but here's what stood out - 1) I asked for tomato creme sauce for my kids pasta and they brought out Alfredo sauce and side of tomato sauce 2) some dishes came out cold so half our guests did not even complete their meals 3) the waiter just had the attitude that we were just bothering him and that he wanted us to wrap it up and get out 3) they did not give me my credit card back and when I called back to ask if they had it they did - why wasn't it given with the receipt ? The answer: not our responsibility so I had to cancel the card and order a new one as we were back on our road trip already.  Food was sub par to the reputation of New York restaurants.  Extremely disappointed and will never return or recommend this restaurants to any of my friends or colleagues who travel to New York,0

10428,"Title: A Culinary Bardo at Benihana 56th Street

Last week, my attempt to revisit a slice of nostalgia at the Benihana on 56th Street in New York City felt more like a passage through the bardo—the Tibetan concept of a liminal state between life cycles—than a simple team lunch. With a double-reservation in hand for our large group, we approached the restaurant confidently, only to be caught in a cycle of waiting, confusion, and anticipation.

Initially, the hostess assured us a room would be forthcoming. After a 30-minute lobby purgatory and a hopeful ascent to our designated space, the bardo deepened: we were left in a private room, nearly forgotten by staff, teased by fleeting appearances of chefs and the tantalizing aroma of grilling meat from afar. The clock ticked, and hunger grew while the sense of time and purpose blurred.

Despite our punctual arrival for a 12:30 reservation, it wasn't until 2 PM that we saw our meal materialize. The chef, while attempting to enliven the scene with the usual Benihana banter, seemed as though he too had been weighed down by the day's dysfunction.

The food, predictably standard for chain fare, had highlights such as the decent fried rice and the reasonably priced ($17 post-tax and tip) heaping portions, contrasted by the lackluster ""spicy"" chicken which lacked any real heat. Be prepared to surrender a little more for beer, as the prices feel steep.

In conclusion, while the food didn't disappoint on price or portion, the service experience was a journey through culinary limbo—a time warp where the concept of a reservation lost all meaning. This was a lunch that strayed far from its intended light-hearted nostalgia, leaving us with a profound reflection on time, expectation, and appetite.",1

16195,"Title: A Cozy Morning at 27 Morton

My latest visit to the rebranded 27 Morton, formerly Doma Na Rohu, offered a familiar ambiance with an upgraded culinary experience. On a quiet Saturday morning, the sparsely filled eatery allowed me the luxury of choice seating.

With a healthy appetite, I indulged in the Bavarian Breakfast, priced at $16, and paired it with a $7 beer—a decision well made. The food arrived promptly within 15 minutes, featuring a mammoth soft-baked pretzel topped with two scrumptiously grilled sausages. The pretzel struck a delightful balance between a crisp exterior and a tender center. However, the experience was slightly marred by the mild mustard that lacked the anticipated piquancy. Thankfully, the sausages themselves were flavorsome enough to stand alone.

The staff, though slightly inattentive, did not significantly detract from the overall experience, as their casual oversight required a bit of effort from my end to capture their attention.

27 Morton serves up satisfying portions and has enough on the menu to warrant a return trip. Despite the minor hiccups, the establishment presents a promising spot for those seeking to savor hearty dishes in a relaxed setting.",1
14087,"I consider myself VERY lucky to get seated right away on a Saturday night. The wait for my food also wasn't long at all. I ordered tacos, wings and wedges. Their street tacos are a must. They are spicy (in my opinion) but they are very good and full of flavor. My Sweet Bbq boneless wings and potatoes wedges were good but I do find the wedges to be on the pricy side considering the small portion you're given.My waiter was also on point and checked in to make sure we were satisfied.",0
18675,"During a recent trip, I decided to switch up my diet from steak and seafood to authentic Chinese cuisine and stumbled upon this gem. Craving something different, I ordered buns and fried chicken wings. Little did I know I was in for a truly immersive experience. It wasn't just authentic; it felt like a culinary teleportation to Asia.

The chicken wings were a highlight – perfectly crispy on the outside, while retaining a succulent juiciness inside. They were an absolute delight. The buns also impressed me with their ideal moisture balance, being far from the dreaded dryness that often plagues lesser versions.

In conclusion, this restaurant is a must-visit for anyone looking for an authentic taste of China. Their mastery of traditional flavors left a lasting impression. I wholeheartedly recommend it and look forward to my next visit.",1
11077,"Title: Worth the Wait at Friedman's!

My friend and I ventured into Friedman's at noon on a bustling Friday, greeted by a daunting line that snaked its way into the neighboring bagel shop. The 30-minute wait and cramped quarters initially made us second-guess our lunch choice. 

However, our perseverance paid off. Seated at a cozy table for two, we dove into an exceptional culinary experience. The artichoke and spinach dip, snapped for posterity, was a delectable starter. Our main courses – a buttermilk fried chicken and a hearty falafel burger – arrived in generous portions, satisfying our hunger with robust flavors.

Our server impressed us with their attentiveness, ensuring our meal was leisurely and enjoyable amidst the relentless crowd that only subsided around 1:30 pm. 

Concluding our visit, my friend and I unanimously agreed that Friedman's had won us over. I eagerly anticipate my next meal here, with their brunch menu already beckoning.",1
15086,"On our last day in NYC, we decided on Pershing Square.  It's right across from Grand Central.  It has a great ambiance to it.  Our service was okay, I'm guessing because it was so busy.  We had amazing seats in a booth looking out the window. I had the Eggs Royale and he has the Eggs Benedict.  Very delicious.  The food was amazing! Definitely recommend to anyone in NYC.",0

19023,"TLDR: UES sushi bar for late night nigiri cravings. One of several Sushi Seki locations. Great for a la carte sushi but for omakase, there are better options to be had and for less money.Ah Sushi Seki, this is a long overdue review but I have mixed feelings here. The main reason I come to Sushi Seki is for when I want late night quality sushi. Craving that hand roll at 12:30 AM? Seki's got you covered. Their a la carte for this level of sushi is actually quite reasonable. My favorite things here are the hand rolls. The Spicy Scallop is their signature temaki, it's this wonderful concoction of fish roe, bay scallop, that spicy mayo and panko. It's wrapped in this delicately crispy nori shell that is just sublime. The hand rolls are very generously sized and for non-luxury (negitoro, uni) choices; $10 to $12 is very fair.So while I think their a la carte is awesome, ironically - I'm not a fan of the omakase. Their name is big enough that bar is consistently full but it just didn't do it for me. The first time I had the omakase, it was enjoyable but quite expensive. There is no set price, it's piece by piece. The second time I came back for omakase, we were literally done in 30 minutes. Now, I was hungry but this was a bit too fast for me. It was the literal definition of an omakase quickie. I felt like I walked in, they rapid-fired my nigiri and sent me on my way.They have several signature pieces (yes, you may recognize them for Gari) like the tuna and tofu sauce, the salmon tomato, the chopped eel and avocado, etc. I will say, that although Gari did it first; Seki's salmon tomato is better. There's something about that slice of king salmon and this perfectly charred, peppered tomato on top.. it's just incredible. The seared toro and onion sauce was good but more of a piece where the ingredients do the work.The style here is more modern/fusion so if that's what you're looking for - I think Sushi Dojo/Ishikawa hold a better value. Gari is my favorite for modern though.Seki is my jam for a la carte and late night cravings. For omakase though, I think there's a lot better options for experience and definitely for price.",0
20789,"I was in the area and was craving pho because who doesn't crave pho. I found this place in yelp as one of the nearby pho places so I decided to give it a try.I ordered the pho with brisket and flank because it doesn't seems like they have a lot of pho options such as tendons or tripe. I also got the summer roll for an appetizer. The summer roll was ok, not a huge fan and the peanut sauce was ok as well. The pho size is pretty decent for the price but the broth lack some of the beefy flavors and overall, I had better pho elsewhere.The place is very cozy and the service was really quick. A decent place for Vietnamese food.",0
13899,"Tucked near the vibrant Flatiron district lies a Thai gem that effortlessly marries elegance with culinary finesse. Upon entry, you're greeted by a lavish display of gold décor, setting the tone for an upscale dining experience that certainly doesn't disappoint.

The convenience began before we even stepped through the door, courtesy of their efficient waitlist system that had us seated without a moment's delay. The menu is a treasure trove of options, and we found ourselves drawn to the Royal Pad Thai and Hor Mok Talay, the latter a gluten-free curry nestled in a coconut shell.

The Royal Pad Thai was not only a visual feast with its intricate egg net and ample garnishes but also a symphony of flavors that earned a resounding 5/5, especially after a spritz of lime. The Hor Mok Talay, while an adventure in texture due to its gluten-free composition, still hit high notes of quality and taste.

To accompany our meal, we indulged in Thai teas and were pleasantly surprised by a complimentary mix of dried banana and taro chips, a thoughtful touch. Yes, the prices are on the steeper side, but it's a fair exchange for the ambiance and quality that elevate your dining experience.

In short, this restaurant stands as a testament to the allure of Thai cuisine, served with a side of sophistication. Highly recommended for those looking to satisfy their cravings in style.",1
14408,"I recently visited a street food gem that served up some of the most delicious rice noodles I've had in a while. At just $4 for two medium servings, accompanied by fish balls drenched in a classic pairing of soy sauce and hoisin, it was a steal. While the fish balls were standard fare, the rice noodles were a standout, boasting the perfect texture.

I also gave their chicken congee a try, priced at $2. It was a satisfactory option for a congee craving, though not quite the highlight. The large may fun, at $8, was decent but fell short on accompaniments. Despite these minor points, the rice noodles have won me over, and I'm already planning my next visit for another round!",1

16950,"Title: A Promising First Taste with Room for Improvement

I recently dined at a restaurant that left a positive impression on me, compelling enough to warrant a return visit. My appetite was modest, so I only indulged in an appetizer and shared a serving of chips and salsa with a companion. My selection, the Huarache con Hongos, was a delightful flatbread dish featuring sautéed mushrooms and a duo of salsas that provided an enjoyable heat. The standout chips and salsa boasted a unique nuttiness and a fresh, less tomato-heavy salsa, justifying the extra cost.

I was impressed by the inclusion of a separate vegetarian menu with vegan-friendly options, though the meat, chicken, and fish items were also abundant for those with different dietary preferences. The only drawback I noted was the scarcity of vegan protein sources, which might leave those with a voracious appetite less satisfied.

The entrée prices, ranging from $20 to $30, seemed fair for the generous portions observed. Service was commendable as well, marked by a courteous server, timely food delivery, and attentive water refills. Overall, a promising venue that could benefit from a more protein-rich vegan selection.",1
12583,"3 of us decided to have brunch here on Saturday at 11am. We made reservations via Yelp App so that was convenient. Upon entering, we were seated at a corner table that barely fits 3 people. The table was awkwardly placed so it was hard for us to get in and out--my boyfriend had to constantly move his chair so that customers left and right can get in/out of their seats. Dishes/drinks we got: -Salmon Avocado Toast ($18)-Matcha & Almond Latte ($8)-Cottage Cheese gnocchi ($17) -Expresso double shot ($5)-Fish Sandwich ($26)-Expresso single shot ($4)The only good thing about this place was the ambiance, service, and coffee. However, the food itself was extremely disappointing for the price we were paying. My salmon avocado toast was extremely underwhelming and lacked flavor though the presentation was great. It was very difficult to cut through the bread with the knife that was provided. Bill came out to be $101 before tip. Overall, I don't think it's worth to come back considering that high price.",0

We were greeted right away and seated.The dining area looks cozy but the wooden chairs are stiff and not comfortable. (cushions would help)My friend Rochelle and I weren't famished; just wanted an appetizer and an entree to share.The menu has traditional Thai offerings such as Thai salad with peanut dressing, chicken satay, steamed dumplings for appetizers. The entrees are also standardsuch as Pad se Ew, Pad Thai, etc.We decided to share the curry puffs: fried( not greasy at all which was nice!) turnovers with minced curry served with a little side of greens and shredded carrots. The sauce that accompanied it was light and had what I think was shredded cabbage in it.The Pad Thai with tofu had a nice presentation and more than enough for two people to share. Unfortunately, it lacked taste. There was too much sauce and the tofu looked soggy and tasted soggy. I prefer tofu toasted not mushy. There were some interesting dessert options but were too full so we skipped it.Rin is definitely worth a second chance. I gave it four stars mostly for the casual elegant ambience.",0
16951,"Title: A Sky-High Culinary Experience at Manhatta

As you ascend to the 60th floor to dine at Manhatta, prepare for your breath to be taken away not just by the food but by the most incredible aerial views of the New York City skyline. The ambiance is the epitome of class, with floor-to-ceiling windows offering killer vistas that rival the allure of the food.

The prix-fixe menu, set at $94 for a generous three-course meal, provides a journey through flavors that are as impressive as the portions. The standout dish was undoubtedly the duck – savory, cooked to perfection, and bursting with flavors that danced on the palate. Equally impressive was the butter-poached lobster, offering chunky, succulent bites that lived up to the promise of perfection, though the farro accompaniment merely held its own.

While the foie gras Rueben started things off on a tepid note, the charcoal-grilled pork belly quickly reignited excitement, arriving on the plate juicy and well-paired with its accompaniments.

Unfortunately, the dessert and cocktail offerings didn't mirror the high standards set by the main dishes. The limited cocktail selection nudged me towards their signature Manhattan – a decision that did not disappoint, as it was exceptionally crafted.

Manhatta’s no-tipping policy adds a modern twist to the dining experience, ensuring the focus remains on the culinary journey and the exceptional views. This venue is perfectly suited for a romantic date night or a special gathering. While the dishes didn't quite leave a lasting imprint on my culinary memory, the overall experience of dining amongst the city lights was truly unforgettable.",1
18881,"Title: A True Taste of India with a Sweet Bonus!

From the very first bite, I knew I had discovered a gem for authentic Indian cuisine. The murg tikka masala was a flavorful delight, while the dal makhni was rich and perfectly spiced. To sweeten the experience, I used a coupon code from Yelp, which landed me a complimentary Ras Malai. This delectable dessert did not disappoint, capping off the meal with its creamy goodness. I am thoroughly impressed and eagerly anticipate my next visit. Without a doubt, I'll be returning to relive this delightful culinary journey.",1

With takeout as the only option available to us right now, we decided to take advantage of the nice weather and walk to the Midtown location for pickup. As other Yelpers have mentioned, their ""Brunch for 2"" option is reasonable and offers a limited listed of classic favorites: 2 entrees, 2 sides and 2 cocktails/juice. All the food was excellent and the cocktails were very cutely packed in jam jars. It was perfect for a Sunday brunch on the patio (see pic). We got the Shrimp and Grits, The Grilled Chicken Sandwich, Jalapeno Grits, Bacon, a Mimosa and a Bloody Mary.",0
3534,"This review is for the Wine Room for Two only. I wanted to celebrate my wife's birthday in a very special and romantic way and Philip Marie did not disappoint. About a month ago I spoke with Richie at PM and he explained how they prepare this very intimate wine room  (10x8) and sent photos, discussed menu choices, options on decorating the space and what type of music that should be playing. They hit it out of the park, truly a magical and very unique romantic dining experience in NYC. Their Motto Food Wine Love was reached in every level.  Food was 5 courses, paid extra for the Beef Wellington that was amazing. Each course came with a wine pairing, and each one was right on the mark. Shout out to our waiter for the evening Andy, he did such a great job explaining all the different options and was very  friendly and professional. My wife was so surprised by this beautiful  dining option it's going to be hard to top this next year. Recommend this to all who are in Love... thanks again Richie and Andy",0
16420,"Upon arrival at the restaurant for lunch, the early crowd was a testament to its popularity, with eager diners lining up before the doors even opened. The dining space filled rapidly, signaling a bustling atmosphere and the demand for their coveted lunchtime fare.

The highlight of the menu is undoubtedly the limited lunch bento boxes, accompanied by a delightful side of soba noodles. Each box offers a culinary adventure, featuring an array of exquisite options like succulent salmon, tender eggplant, and crispy tempura. While I couldn't recount the entire selection, every dish sampled was a pleasant encounter with flavor.

The only slight disappointment was the portion of soba noodles. For enthusiasts drawn primarily for the noodle experience, a more generous serving would make the meal perfect. Nonetheless, the quality of the bento truly warrants an early visit; it's an opportunity not to be missed for a taste of authentic and diverse offerings.",1
14076,"The line was long but it went by very fast. Unfortunately they ran out of the pork taco, but the chicken and beef made up for it. I really love how there's sides and extras on the counters, and the tomato salsa was amazing, with a little kick to it. Although the tacos were pricier then expected, it is new york. Afterwards we went to times square and because it was so good, we even made our way to the Los Tacos there, but unfortunately it was closed for the ball drop. :(",0
10005,"Title: A Slice of Joy Amidst New York Hustle

Despite an hour-long wait in the chilly New York breeze and being seated at a less-than-ideal spot by the bustling kitchen entrance, this restaurant stands as a beacon of joy in the heart of the city. The close-set tables and ordinary culinary offerings take a back seat as the servers steal the show, enveloping diners in an infectious atmosphere of laughter and fun. The lentil soup and buffalo wings are satisfying, and the whimsical dessert menu adds a sweet touch to the experience. Be sure to carry cash to tip the splendid staff who make the otherwise forgettable inconveniences fade away, leaving you with a night of delightful entertainment that's hard to find anywhere else. Expect a long wait, but also expect to leave with a wide smile.",1
1409,"Title: A Delightful Brunch Experience During NY Restaurant Week

My friend and I decided to indulge in Sunday brunch at this gem during NY Restaurant Week, and we were nothing short of impressed. The moment we tasted the food and the sangrias, we knew we had made the right choice. Both the tofu with ginger scallion dressing and the homemade vegetable dumplings stood out as appetizers, bursting with flavor and setting a high bar for the meal to follow.

Our entrees, the bibimbaps, did not disappoint with their perfect balance of flavors and irresistible crispy rice texture. The service matched the quality of the food – attentive and warm, making us feel right at home.

The only hiccup was our initial seating at a communal table, which felt cramped. However, a simple request saw us promptly reseated at a more comfortable spot. It's worth noting that larger groups might actually find these communal tables quite fitting.

With such a positive first impression, we're eager to return and dive into their regular menu. This spot is definitely on our ""must-visit-again"" list!",1
11977,"Ambiance: 4.5/5
Service: 4.5/5
Food Quality: 2.5/5
Value: 3/5

Review:
I had high hopes for this spot with its stunning decor and beautiful food presentation, but unfortunately, the flavors didn't match the aesthetics. The standout was the non-alcoholic Mango Sunrise drink, which, after some ice melt, was refreshingly sweet and a pure delight. However, the eats were a bit of a letdown.

The Curry Puffs were disappointing - mushy and lacking in the promised chicken - while the Pla Muk Tod calamari missed the mark on texture and flavor, not living up to its adventurous description. The Tom Juad soup was passable, with fresh shrimp, but it didn't deliver on the expected flavors, and the Gai Hor Bang Touy, despite tasty seasoning, was surprisingly greasy.

The Royal Pad Thai looked impressive but was too sweet for my taste, tipping the scales on my palate. Dessert was a mixed bag; the Banana Crepe was flaky but suffered from mushy banana, and while the Mor Khang Brulee with smooth coconut ice cream was my dessert pick, it was exceedingly sweet.

Overall, despite the exceptional service, the food was a case of style over substance, leaving me feeling that the place is largely overhyped.",1
17580,"I've had the pleasure of sampling two bowls through Mealpal and have been thoroughly impressed by both. Each dish was packed with flavor and provided a satisfying and filling meal without leaving me feeling overindulged. 

The Ginger Shio Koji Pork Bowl quickly became my top pick – a delightful twist on the traditional roast pork commonly found in Chinese restaurants. Though not quite as tender, the pork was succulent and lean, served over rice with a mix of greens that complemented the dish both visually and nutritionally.

The Moroccan Bowl, on the other hand, took me by surprise with its roasted vegetables being the standout feature. They've somehow turned greens into a craving! The steak was savory and cooked to perfection, harmonizing with the light sauce that dressed the dish. 

Both bowls are a testament to the restaurant's commitment to delivering hearty meals that balance taste and health – a combination that's hard to beat.",1
21020,"Title: Delightful Eats with Mixed Service Experience

I recently dined at this gem of a restaurant and was thoroughly impressed by the culinary offerings. The double smashed avocado was a standout, easily becoming my personal favorite. If you're an eggs benedict connoisseur like myself, you'll find their rendition to be the best one to grace your palate in years. 

I was particularly surprised by the waffle paired with vegan strawberry butter, so delectable and gluten-free to boot—a true testament to their considerate menu design. However, it wasn't all smooth sailing. 

Regrettably, I have to dock a star for the aspects that detracted from the overall experience. Service left a bit to be desired—the welcome was lukewarm at best and our waiter's approach to tipping came across as coercive, which tainted the otherwise lovely meal.

Additionally, my matcha latte missed the mark with its bitterness, despite being made with my usual almond milk. While the interior felt a bit cramped, I'd opt for the outdoor seating on a return visit for a breath of fresh air and hopefully a service experience that matches the food's high standards. 

Rating: 4/5",1
18586,"*Mealpal Lunch Review*Not a bad Chinese place on a cold winter day. Ordered the sesame chicken via Mealpal. Seamless pick up process. Food wise it wasn't too bad. The dish came with enough rice, chicken and vegetables. The egg roll was smaller than what they previously had. Not sure if they recently revised the sizing or they ran out. Portion wise I approve - I couldn't finish the whole thing, nor was I starving thereafter! Couldn't do this everyday though!",0

It was a bit pricey for a pizza but I didn't realize how big it was until the waiter came out with it. The pizza was enough for two of us and we even took some of it to go. I strongly recommend choosing garlic for topping because it made the pizza even more flavorful. The restaurant also has a great ambiance, perfect for any occasions!",0

No amount of seasoning could salvage the few bites I took, which is disappointing, to say the least. Additionally, I found the bar seats quite uncomfortable.

If you want to dine in, their store has very limited seating, only 3-4 bar seats facing the window. You order by choosing a protein and it comes with pickled side dishes and rice or salad.

3390,"I recently had the opportunity to try out the cactus tacos at a local restaurant, and they were a delightful experience. The tacos were savory with just the right amount of spice to tantalize the taste buds. However, it's important to note for fellow plant-based diners that the restaurant offers limited vegetarian/vegan options. For a fully vegetarian meal, I recommend opting for the corn tortillas since the flour ones contain lard. Overall, a tasty option for those looking for a bit of heat in their meal.",1
18628,"Upon my recent visit to this delightful eatery, I must recommend securing a spot in the back room. The kitchen's energy is palpable from there, though be warned you might leave with a lingering pork aroma. The Corn Salad was pleasant, yet forgettable. In contrast, the Mushroom Salad with Shrimp stood out with its sumptuous flavors and quality ingredients.

The Half Hainanese Duck dish was an absolute treat—tender and bursting with authentic flavors, it's a must-try for Hainanese cuisine aficionados. As for the Grilled Sirloin, it was cooked to a perfect medium rare, meltingly tender and truly satisfying.

On a less impressive note, the Sizzling Sisig failed to match my palate preferences, and the Pork Belly Adobo was mediocre at best. Similarly, the Khao Soi left much to be desired with its overcooked noodles.

However, the Halo Halo dessert redeemed any culinary missteps with its mesmerizing blend of ube ice cream, egg custard, rice crispies, coconut, and more, culminating in a thrilling finale to the meal.",1
16308,"Title: A Unique Twist on Chicken Sandwiches at The Chirp

I recently visited The Chirp for a taste of their much-talked-about chicken sandwich and left impressed by their unique spin on a classic. The Chirp Chicken Sandwich ($9) is a delightful departure from the standard fried fare, featuring tender rotisserie chicken coated in a tangy green sauce with the added richness of mashed plantain. Tucked into a soft bun with a crisp lettuce leaf and a slice of tomato, it's a small but flavor-packed option for any sandwich aficionado.

While they charge an extra 50 cents for additional sauce, it's well worth it for those who enjoy an extra kick. The service was decent, and the complimentary lemon water was a refreshing touch, although the lack of a bathroom might be an inconvenience to some. The seating is ample, making it a comfortable spot to enjoy a meal.

I'm fond of their approach to the chicken sandwich and believe that Peruvian cuisine has a special place in the culinary scene of NYC. I'm eagerly hoping The Chirp expands to more locations in the city. Return visits are definitely in my future.",1

That may be a weird statement from someone who has written 3000+ reviews on Yelp, but my wife recently grew this adorable parasite inside her stomach, and ever since it emerged it's essentially destroyed the lives we used to have. And nice restaurant meals were one of the first casualties.I'm telling you this because if you also don't get out enough, you want to make every meal count. You want to make it special when you finally escape from the tiny tyrant that runs your every waking moment. And Manhatta is special.This restaurant is gorgeous. The room, the bar, the ceilings, the waiting area...it is a ethereal place to dine, and would be even without the absolutely stunning view. You're looking out over the best city in the world, from a vantage point so high that you can watch a storm move over the city and past the bridges. The service is impeccable. It's the absolute epitome of Danny Meyer's ability to make every patron feel like an honored guest. The host asked if we were celebrating a special occasion, and upon hearing it was our anniversary, brought us to a corner table by the window where we were awed by the aforementioned view. The food is beautiful, and more importantly, delicious. The French Onion Burger manages to be unique and special in a city filled with decadent burgers all trying to outdo one another. The Oysters Rockefeller were actually perfect. The fish was excellent. And although we were too full for dessert, the truffles offered with a lovely anniversary message were the coup de grace. It's hard to imagine a better experience, and we will absolutely be back for another special occasion soon.",0

12748,"Title: A Culinary Gem in North Harlem: A Taste of the Dominican Vibe

I recently ventured into the heart of North Harlem, near the bustling Dominican community around 149th & Broadway, to discover a vibrant and unassuming eatery next to the ever-popular Harlem Public. With no signage to guide me, I stepped into a lively space that left me momentarily confused - no waitstaff greeted us, leading to a self-service epiphany at the bar (a slight hiccup in service but forgivable).

The ambiance was welcoming, with gender-neutral bathrooms featuring an external sink and tasteful decor adjacent to an arcade with a unique horseshoe table. But let's dive into the main event - the food.

The Wings were succulently tender, enveloped in a sweet and satisfying BBQ sauce, the perfect crunchy exterior encapsulating flawlessly cooked chicken. The Hot Thigh sandwich was a delicious, albeit messy, affair with flavorsome buffalo sauce and tangy blue cheese overwhelming the Martin's roll - a lighter hand with the dressing would've made this dish shine brighter. 

The Wallace Cheeseburger, a seemingly simple creation, impressed with its subtle ranch mayo twist and its moist, crumbly patties with hints of dry-aged flavor - a straightforward yet standout burger. Accompanying waffle fries hit the right notes of standard comfort. 

But the showstopper was the grilly cheesesteak. Its excellence lay in each cheesy, flavorful bite, encapsulated by perfectly grilled bread. It's a dish that's earned a rapid recommendation to my uptown friends.

A pleasant surprise was the dog-friendly outdoor seating area, teeming with canine companions and adding to the welcoming vibe of the locale.

In summary, despite a couple of minor service and food tweaks needed, this spot captures the essence of Dominican charm with an enticing menu. Eagerly looking forward to my next visit, I rate this North Harlem gem a solid 4 stars.",1

15051,"I might not be the biggest pizza enthusiast, but Emmy Squared's reputation tempted me to give it a go—and it's safe to say I was impressed.

We chose the Big Ang, with its sumptuous blend of vodka sauce, ricotta, and meatballs, complemented by a zing of banana pepper. It was an absolute delight, bursting with flavor. The Hot Chicken, on the other hand, wasn't to my liking, but that's just a matter of personal taste. Service was top-notch, props to our attentive waiter. Just a tip: considering the cozy size of the venue, booking a table for Friday nights or weekends would be wise.",1
1545,"The food deserves five stars but the service deserves 2/3 stars. I had heard about the hype surrounding this restaurant and wanted to try it for myself. Because of the food, I understand why they got attention, plus the decorations. It's really just the service that they messed up on.Our waiter was not really paying attention to our needs. He was trying to persuade us To order more expensive dishes but couldn't refill our water on time. There were several times at the table where I was sitting with an empty water glass, it sounds like a small thing but it's really the least a waiter can do.I got the garlic cauliflower lollipops which are not on a stick despite the name but are absolutely delicious. I also ordered the crab curry and it was the perfect amount of spice to help clear my sore throat. For a drink, I had the mango lassi. It was the first time I ever tried a lassie drink, it was good but I don't think it really goes with the food.Overall I would recommend coming here to try the food but don't expect much from the service.(Also the decorations and the bathroom were very nice!)",0
3043,"The gods gave the vegans one gift, and it was Superiority Burger. I had tried Superiority Burger just once about a year ago, and thought it was superb that time - this second visit cemented my opinion. It was a rainy Sunday night when we came in, but there was a line of customers waiting to order (as there generally are). Between my first and second visits, they have installed several small tables on the side and front walls, so perhaps around 8 people can sit in to eat. There is also another side wall, for people who want to stand inside and eat. The line went quickly, and we placed our order. Service was friendly and efficient. We ordered the vegan Superiority Burger ($6, also available vegetarian, with regular dairy cheese), beet special, sloppy joe, and burnt broccoli. Our order was ready in about 15 minutes, and we took it home to eat. I'd had the yuba new creation the first time I ate here, and while it was great, it in no way compared to the superiority burger, which blew my mind. The burger was a thick patty, with a texture akin to a vegetable croquette, a bit mushy, but delicious. It was served with vegan cheese, onions, and lettuce, on a soft, small bun. The burger is small, but it is better for your waistline this way. My husband had the sloppy joe, which is slightly larger than the superiority burger, with comes with some sort of vegetarian ingredient that resembles meat, in a thick, tomato based sauce with fried onions, on hamburger bread. They'll really have you fooled for thinking it's the real thing. I had a hard time deciding which I liked better between the sloppy joe, and the burger. Our sides of broccoli and beets were also superb. The burnt broccoli was not really very burnt, was served with coriander, cashews, and a delicious grey sauce, which I had no idea what was made of. The beets were not as good as the broccoli, but still tasty and refreshing. Prices are extremely modest compared to Manhattan food places. Would highly recommend for vegetarian and non-vegetarians alike.",0
18670,"Title: Quaint Ambiance, Lackluster Brunch

My friend and I visited this establishment for Sunday brunch, with high hopes but left feeling underwhelmed. The overall experience was decent, but not compelling enough to draw me back for brunch, especially considering the competition at this price point.

My companion opted for the croque madam and was quite pleased with her choice. However, my avocado toast was disappointing. The presentation was unusual, featuring sliced avocado instead of the traditional mashed, coupled with an odd combination of grapefruit and sour cream. Unfortunately, the dish lacked flavor. The coffee also failed to impress, being just passable.

Despite the food, the restaurant's ambiance and decor offered a delightful setting. Its charming atmosphere left a good impression, and I might consider returning to sample their wine selection in the evening. But when it comes to their brunch offerings, I'll be taking my appetite elsewhere.",1
15755,"Nothing fancy here, just good, authentic New York pies!  Busy place, doing tons of deliveries, with a crowded (you gotta see how many guys they crowd into this little kitchen) kitchen that requires a delicate ""dance"" to get it all done!  Fascinating!  Fun to watch!  A slice and a Diet Coke - $5.50.",0
20054,"If you're looking for a quick, reasonably priced Asian meal in Essex Market, this place is a hit. The menu features standout options like Fried Chicken Hainese Rice and the traditional Hainese Chicken over rice – both delicious, with the former being a tad indulgent and the latter a lighter choice. Expect to spend around $10 per person for a hearty serving, sans appetizers. The rice, richly flavored with chicken fat, and the complimentary soup are particularly noteworthy. A great spot for satisfying your Asian food cravings without breaking the bank.",1
1050,"Title: Satisfying Lunch Set with a Side of Wifi

My visit to the restaurant, initially motivated by the allure of black taglierini, took an unexpectedly delightful turn when I discovered their lunch sets. Although the coveted taglierini wasn't part of the lunch deal, the Spaghetti Giuseppe with added shrimp that I settled on did not disappoint.

Priced at a reasonable $10.95, the lunch sets included a starter of soup or salad and a vegetarian pasta, with the option to upgrade by adding chicken, sausage, or shrimp for a small additional cost. My recommendation? Go for the sausage. It not only presents better value but also seems to be a crowd-pleaser based on the generous portion and appealing presentation.

The cream of broccoli soup was a highlight – creamy and comforting. As for the Spaghetti Giuseppe, it struck a satisfying balance, portion-wise, making it a perfect lunch choice without leaving you overly stuffed. However, it fell short on the advertised garlic punch, which could be amped up to meet contemporary taste buds fervent for garlic.

A pleasant surprise was the inclusion of veggies in the dish, contributing a nod to health amidst the indulgence. To top it off, the restaurant provides free wifi, a convenient touch for a connected experience. Would I return? Absolutely, if only to finally try the black taglierini.",1
106,"Title: Cozy Dinner with a Side of Crowds at Cascabel

I recently dined at Cascabel and came away with mixed feelings, meriting a solid 3.5 stars. The service was on point—attentive without being overbearing—and the meal itself was enjoyable overall.

However, space is at a premium here. My table was uncomfortably close to a neighboring one, to the extent that I felt like an unintentional participant in a stranger's conversation. Privacy was definitely in short supply.

A point of concern was the 'grade pending' status of the restaurant. I typically steer clear of places without a clear health rating, and this took me by surprise.

Now, onto the star of the show – the food:

- **Carne Asada Burrito ($14)**: Generously filled with steak, rice, beans, pico de gallo, and cheese, it's a hefty offering. I opted for yuca fries, which were disappointingly cold. A swap for sweet potato fries might be a safer bet.

- **Pollo Torta ($12)**: Though this pulled chicken sandwich can get a bit messy, it was tasty with a nice combination of chicken, black bean spread, cheese, and lettuce, paired well with sweet potato fries.

- **Churros**: A delightful end to the meal, especially as a complimentary treat for checking in. Who could argue with free churros and melted chocolate?

In conclusion, Cascabel delivers a decent dining experience that's shadowed by its cramped seating and current lack of a definitive health rating. While I enjoyed the flavors on my plate, I'll be holding off on a return visit until they've cleared up that health score.",1
13956,"Finally returned after 4 years, and so much has changed! The menu is similar, from what I remember, but the space is significantly different - so much roomier and prettier! There are fairy lights strewn throughout the interior, and each table has a very cute decorated paper bag enclosing a lit candle. It's super romantic!Once you're seated, you're offered bread with olive oil, and bottled tap water. The olive oil is so delicious and fragrant, and comes with actual pitted olives. It's fruity and fresh, and I couldn't stop myself from dipping the bread so that it sops up the oil.Both my friend and I decided to order from the special menu that day. She got the ravioli with tomato and basil, whereas I opted for the monkfish with grilled calamari, olive sauce, and sauteed kale / mashed potatoes (I substituted the potatoes with sauteed spinach). She loved her choice, while I cleaned off my plate completely! The monkfish, grilled in olive oil, was perfectly moist and rich. The grilled calamari was a bit more disappointing; it was a little tough and not as tender. The olive sauce was made of chopped, minced olives, and was super fatty - particularly when coupled with the olive oil. Overall, the dish had way too much olive oil - there was a ton used to cook the vegetables and meat -  (too much of a good thing, how ironic!), but the addition of some lemon juice helped tremendously.We also chose to share a dessert, and debated between the nutella tiramisu and flourless chocolate cake. I ultimately suggested the flourless cake with ice cream, as I wasn't in the mood for a creamier dessert. The slice of cake that arrived was huge, more than enough for two people. I'm glad we got a scoop of ice cream, as it helped balance the richness of the cake with its temperature and lower sweetness level. The cake was so moist! It was quite dense but delightfully chocolatey and rich. Pepe Giallo is an affordable spot for classic Italian - it's great for smaller groups (i.e., dates and friend get-togethers). Definitely a favourite to visit when I'm in the city! :)",0
13291,"Title: A Serendipitous Find at Ted's

In a delightful turn of events, our quest for a specific eatery led us to the familiar comforts of Ted's. The warm welcome from the hostess and immediate seating in a cozy booth set a positive tone for our meal. Our server, Amanda, promptly took our beverage order, catering to our preferences with skill.

For our meal, the bison chili and side salad were my picks, while my husband enjoyed a succulent cheeseburger paired with a half-and-half of fries and onion rings. The restaurant buzzed with activity, yet there was an air of calm efficiency. Cleanliness and good lighting, coupled with the consistent decor reminiscent of their Georgia and Florida locations, evoked a sense of home.

While it was slightly warm inside, the external chill made it bearable. Our food arrived perfectly cooked, brought to us by a friendly staff member. Amanda was attentive, ensuring we had everything we needed, including hot water, ketchup, and mayonnaise.

Culminating our meal, we indulged in a shareable snickerdoodle with vanilla ice cream - a sweet finish to our laid-back dining experience. With top-notch service and delectable fare, Ted's once again proved to be exactly what we wanted and needed.",1
12674,"It is rare that a restaurant gets so many things right. From the warm, inviting ambiance, excellent service, to the wonderful food, Cafe Katja does it all perfectly. This was a perfect choice for our last night visiting our son in the city. We shared the ample Aufschnitt Teller; there was plenty for the three of us. All items on the plate were excellent, with the standout being the pork belly. Each of us had a different main course: Bratwurst, Wiener Schnitzel, and Gulasch. They were all excellently prepared and presented.",0
13819,"Title: Good but Pricey Milkshakes

I'd like to echo the sentiments of previous reviewers in my brief take on this spot. The milkshakes here, especially the cookies and cream, are undeniably delicious, with a perfect consistency and a delightful topping of crunchy Oreos, peanuts, and chocolate. It's clear why it's a menu favorite. However, while tastebuds were satisfied, the experience didn't justify the steep price of $8.50. Comparable delights are available elsewhere, whether you opt for luxury at Godiva or value at Shake Shack. Thus, I can't rate them too highly; good shakes, but your wallet won't be as pleased.",1
1826,"Sonnyboy is literally across the street from my apartment. Sometimes I look out my balcony (not trying to sound like a creep), and there's always people here, regardless of hour or weather. I've always heard many good things about their brunch so I was intrigued. I came here with a bunch of friends from SF on a Saturday noon. We got on yelp's waitlist which was super convenient. As we were seated, staff was super friendly in asking us what we wanted to drink. Food- I ordered the Harissa Folded Egg + grilled chicken on the side (their signature) and my friends got the crispy chicken sandwich. The harissa egg was super soft and flavorful. There was a kick to the peppers but it set a nice spicy balance. It was wonderfully delicious. My friends thought the crispy chicken was slightly on the crispier side, but overall was decent. Price is on the higher end as my dish came out to be $26!!! LOL just take my money, New York!!! Overall, good experience. And since it's across the street, I'm sure I'll be back for their happy hours and mimosas.",0
19430,"This was a pretty big hype back when I lived in NYC. Saw a video on FB and instantly wanted to come here. Restaurant is known to basically wipe melted cheese on top of whatever you order, which is pretty frikin' awesome. It's always busy, and we actually had to go elsewhere the first time we tried coming because of the long wait. It's not a big restaurant. The ambiance is very moody, and great for a date. Lots of tables for intimate parties. Service was great. The food was actually just okay and the portion wasn't huge, but the cheese was what made this awesome. I guess it's the experience that you are really aiming for.Recommendations: One time experience, probably with a date.",0
3474,"I came to New York to attend a birthday dinner for my friend on a Friday night. I was really excited after finding out we would be eating at a an Ethiopian restaurant since I have never gone to one before and it had great reviews. Most of the guest shared a large meat plate but I decided to get a separate vegan plate because I am a pescatarian. Since there was so many of us, it did take a long time to get our orders out( but this was mainly our fault for not ordering timely). Despite all of the orders and confusions, the servers were still able to get everything out accurately.The food was amazing and flavorful! I overall enjoyed my experience at Awash and will definitely be coming back next time i'm in New York.",0
20669,"Such a delightful bowl of ramen. It was extremely tasty and the pork was tender. I usually don't like my ramen with pork being that the pork is generally pretty tough but fortunately, that wasn't the case here. This ramen  restaurant is oddly next door to totto ramen restaurant. I'm assuming they are the same owners. Hide-Chan is located on the second floor. It's worth the flight of the stairs. Order your ramen wavy and try the Deluxe ramen.

We shared between three of us, it we still got leftovers, that we took with us! I will definitely come back!",0
10121,"Japanese-styled fast food - order at the front and when the buzzer buzzes, pick up your food in the front. Ordered the soft shell crab bun (came out to $14) - 'twas delicious! Flavorful soft shell crab with crunchiness from the cole slaw. My friend ordered the same and he thought there was too much cole slaw/it was too crunchy, it was hard to taste the crab. My other friend ordered the kobeyaki burger and she said that it tasted like a regular burger but more Asianified, like banh mi but in a bun.  Everything other than your main order is self-serve - the napkins, utensils, sauces, etc. The creamy spaces include wasabi mayo, spicy mayo, and teriyaki ketchup, which go great with burgers and fries!A lot of seating inside (many empty tables on a Friday night) and a unisex restroom to use, but it's also a nice option to take your meal and go down the block to Bryant Park to soak in the nice balmy weather this time of year!",0

10918,"Joe and Pat's was recommended to us by friends, so we decided to go for some late night pizza. We got there around 11pm on a Saturday night. There were still some tables finishing up. With plenty of table options, we unfortunately were seated next to what turned out to be some very intoxicated people, one of which actually fell out of her chair. However, once they left it was a much more pleasant experience. We ordered the Tri Pie (vodka, tomato and pesto sauce) large pizza to split, which was fine for two people since the crust is pretty thin. It is on the pricier side for pizza but I think it was worth it. It's a nice combination between all three sauces, so I highly recommend it. Our waitress was so sweet and even took the cost of the soda off the bill since she originally forgot to bring it. I'd like to go back and try some of their other dishes besides pizza!",0
18725,"I recently dined at a local restaurant that has been receiving some buzz, and I was left rather underwhelmed. The food was mediocre at best; it failed to impress, particularly with a kabob dish that was excessively oily and over-salted to the point of being inedible. Cleanliness appeared to be a secondary concern at this establishment, which further detracted from the experience.

Service was another sore point—we experienced a significant delay, as it took our server 15 minutes just to dish out three plates and two soups. This resulted in a disjointed dining experience where one person was served while the others waited, leading to everyone's meals cooling down before we could eat together.

To top it all off, the pricing was steep, costing $70 for three combo meals and two soups, which did not reflect the quality or the service provided. It puzzles me why there is so much hype around this place. Sadly, I cannot justify the expense for such a lackluster dining experience and cannot recommend it to others.",1
21014,"ROLLN is exactly what you'd expect. Pros include: clean space, trendy spot, fresh fish, extremely short wait. Cons: little seating, high bar stools, expensive for small portions I stopped by for a quick lunch and ordered on one of their kiosks. I balked at the prices-- each roll was $3.75 and up and they did not seem that big. There were combo meals of 2 rolls with edamame, and a bento box, but I didn't feel like it was worth the price. I decided to order a shrimp tempura handroll and a salmon avocado hand roll. My order was ready in about 2 minutes. The quality of the fish was on point! It tasted very fresh. I was surprised that I wasn't that hungry after the meal, even though the rolls were pretty small. Each is about 5 inches long. Even though the rolls tasted good, I probably wouldn't come back because they were relatively simple and I can't justify paying almost $9 for it.",0

15490,"After catching some buzz on a local news segment, I swung by the nugget joint on 14th Street to see what the hype was about. The restaurant delivered on its promise of freshness with made-to-order nuggets that hit the mark on size. While the batter could use a bit more zing, it makes sense given their vast array of dipping sauces and flavored nuggets – there’s no need to overshadow those tastes.

I opted for the General Tso Swag nuggets for a spicy twist and wasn’t disappointed. Pairing an order of classic nuggets with Smokin' Js BBQ Sauce turned out to be a stellar choice – a definite must-try.

The place isn't really set up for a sit-down meal, sporting minimal seating to keep the turnover quick. It fits since nuggets are the ultimate grab-and-go fare. I’m already plotting my next visit to sample more flavors. If you’re in the area and craving a quick bite, this spot's worth the stop.",1

We shared a hot tea pot, some calimari and dumplings. It was all good.I ordered their duck ramen which was more of a duck udon noodle soup but still very flavourful with a broth, full of depth. They packaged the broth separately so as to maintain the duck's crispy skin with its fat, rendered, just how I like it. I also ordered some chicken pineapple fried rice for hubby as well as some rolls and dumplings for us to share at home.The prices are still very reasonable and their food is still just as good as I remember it being.

Without fail, each New York City trip includes multiple visits to Prince Street Pizza – a testament to its magnetic charm and authentic NYC vibe. The in-house fresh mozzarella melds flawlessly with their sensational sauce atop an impeccable crust, making for an unrivaled pizza experience.

Their thin crust Margherita is a classic delight, while the thick crust square pepperoni, with its spicy kick, is an adventurous must-try. Be prepared for a queue, but rest assured, it's worth the wait and moves quickly.

At Prince Street Pizza, toppings like ranch or blue cheese are unnecessary distractions. Here, it's all about the pure taste of pizza, with the only embellishments you need being crushed red peppers, Parmesan, or a dash of pepper. Simply put, it's the best pizza I've ever had.",1

I've been an upper west sider for many moons now, and as soon as Maison Pickle opened, I needed to talk to my job about getting a raise bc I have a new monthly (sometimes weekly) investment to make. Here's what you need to know:Vibes: Epic. Great lighting, great music always, booth seating, really amazing looking bar, shelves and shelves of liquor that actually look classy vs cheesy. Important tip - since this place is now a super popular brunch staple in the area, brunch on Sat and Sun is pretty ""lit"" as the cool kids say. It's loud, fun atmosphere, but not what you want if you're looking for something quiet. Staff: So great. Customer service is #1 to me, and through their reservations system they definitely have a process for when regulars come back. I'm always treated like family. The servers are fun and engaging and actually seem to like their jobs. Food: It's a wow. I've been there for brunch, lunch and dinner - brunch is definitely my fave by a mile. Best dishes (in my humble opinion) are: potato pancake with smoked salmon (I get it every. single. time. no joke), French dip sandwiches - bomb - you'll prob be in a food coma after, French toast - YUM, deviled eggs (made with olive oil instead of mayo). You also can't go wrong with the skillet omelettes or the Buffalo Mac. Desserts = YES. Cocktails: so fun and good. Bartenders are awesome - if you sit at the bar you will have great convo and great cocktails. They make a damn good Aperol Sour with egg white - trust me.

I'm SO upset I hadn't heard of this place earlier in my life lol. Only problem is that there's usually a line to get seated and that line is outside in the cold and the host doesn't give an estimate on how long you have to wait.

16044,"I recently visited this restaurant on a Thursday evening and was pleasantly surprised by the brief 10-minute wait for a table for three. The seating area beyond the bar is spacious, comfortably accommodating groups of four. Service was impeccable, with our server being both swift and attentive.

My dinner included the Chicken Paitan with Pork, which featured a robust broth teeming with noodles, onions, and scallions. The pork added to the dish was tender and well-seasoned, boasting a satisfying fat-to-meat ratio. It was an overall impressive bowl of ramen. Alongside, I sampled the Takoyaki; while the interior was creamy and savory, and the exterior chewy, the dish didn't leave a lasting impression on me and isn't something I'd reorder.

In terms of value for money, I would rate the restaurant as follows:

- Price: 4/5
- Quality: 4/5
- Quantity: 5/5
- Service: 5/5
- Atmosphere: 3/5

It's a solid choice for a good meal, though the atmosphere could be more engaging.",1

I would've eaten a whole plate of these if I had the appetite!For my entree, I had the poached eggs ""norvégien"", or Raoul's spin on salmon eggs Benedict. The eggs were perfectly runny and the salmon was top notch, but the bagel really made the dish! The perfect ratio of crispy to chewy, and the everything bagel topping was probably the best I've had.

They brought out bread which was a focaccia. Amazing and delicious! We both ordered gnocchi. With any pasta, you get to pick a sauce with it. I got mine with vodka sauce and added chicken. My boyfriend got it with Alfredo and added chicken. Oh man the gnocchi was absolutely amazing! It was so pillowy and delicious. The vodka sauce was delicious as well. I tried a bite of the Alfredo and it was divine! Although the prices were kind of high for the amount of food we got, it was still a great meal. It's a great spot for a date or anniversary. Very cute place with friendly people.",0
21119,The interior was nice and quite upscale so I thought it would be decent Chinese food. However what we ordered was just not really up to expectation considering the price. It's either overcooked or too oily or too salty.Service is not bad though but just not going to come back for the food.,0
17390,"It met all my expectations from great servers to ama Inc food and wine! We started out with the wedge salad and the Brussel sprouts and spinach salad!! Both salads were huge enough to feed three people each!! Blue cheese was so fresh and tasty! They brought us their fairy meal cornbread was is delish!! I ordered the New York Strip, my husband ordered the salmon and our friends orders the short ribs. We also ordered a side of potatoes, green beans and Mac n cheese gnocchi! The gnocchi was over the top. My steak was cooked perfectly and seasoned to perfection. Our servers Kaylor and Peter were outstanding! Thank you for a wonderful meal!!",0
10108,"This place has the best perogies hands down. I legit tried all of the ones that they offered fried. Literally so good. Also there was a very refreshing watermelon drink that they offered that was very good. This review is uncharacteristically short because literally, I logged on just to say. Perogies, good. 10/10 would recommend. Come here if you have a spare 35 min.",0
17849,"One of the oldest steakhouses in New York (1884). Came here for dinner the other night and was decently impressed. It might possibly be due to the cut of steak I ordered, an 18oz sirloin which I am not a fan of sirloins but my friend insisted. To start off our meal, we ordered the calamari, rock shrimp duo. The calamari sauce was delicious, however the rock shrimp won that battle. These appetizers took a while, and I mean a while, to come out. We then received our arugula salad, 18oz sirloin, and our two sides, the truffle mac n cheese and the creamed spinach. The sirloin was alright, and the creamed spinach was average. The best truffle mac n cheese I have ever had though! The arugula salad was also delicious. The drinks were good as well (I got a Riesling). I am not sure if I would be dying to go back here any time soon but it was a cool experience.",0
12771,"Came here with some friends to celebrate the end of fall semester and had a great time, we literally stayed til closing! That said, we had the fall menu and it was amazing. Just walking into the restaurant we knew we were in for a nice treat. They have a fixed menu dinner set for $65 paired with wine, all you can drink btw ;) I had the soup and fish and the soup sure did warm up my tummy and left my tastebuds asking for more. There are 4 different wines they provide as well. I definitely will come back here to try all the different seasons! Highly recommend!",0
14655,"Mari Vanna offers an eclectic and homey dining experience, blending the coziness of a Russian home with an unexpected urban touch of wall graffiti. My impromptu Sunday buffet visit was met with accommodating service despite lacking a reservation, placing me conveniently near the entrance.

The buffet's standout was the bottomless mimosas, a delightful accompaniment to the spread. Delving into the dishes, the potato dumplings emerged as favorites, closely followed by a flavorful tomato rice. The variety of salads was mostly mayo-based, but the fresh vegetable salad proved to be a refreshing alternative.

A surprising discovery was the uniquely shaped chicken legs, with succulent meat on plump sticks, devoid of skin or meat near the bone – quirky yet delicious. Concluding the meal, the meringue dessert left a sweet and satisfying impression.

Mari Vanna's Sunday buffet is indeed a delightful culinary adventure, and a visit comes highly recommended for those seeking a taste of Russia with a twist.",1
13398,"I recently stopped by this restaurant for their lunch combos and I must say, I was thoroughly impressed. I chose the soon dubu stew paired with BBQ galbi and it was a fantastic decision. The tofu stew, brimming with seafood and beef chunks, was flavorful enough to stand alone as a hearty dish. However, the true highlight was the galbi – marinated to perfection and remarkably tender. Overall, a delicious and satisfying meal. Highly recommended for anyone craving authentic flavors.",1
15060,"Not for me. We came in a party of 4 on a Sunday night, hungry and cold so anything should taste delicious at this point but no. None of us liked our ramen. Beef Bone Marrow Gyukotsu $18 - The bone marrow melted into the broth making it rich and thicker. However, the noodles were waaaaaaay too oily and tastes store-bought rather than freshly hand-made. Too much diced scallions and garlic chives in my bowl, overpowering the soup and noodles. I was dehydrated for the rest of the night. The smell was also way too strong, it stays in your mouth for 24hrs+. I brushed my teeth and rinsed my mouth with super strong mouth wash, and the next day, I could still smell this broth and its ingredients in my mouth. Not sure how it won its award 2x.Shinka Tonkotsu $15 - One piece of fatty pork in the ramen. The pork was too old; old pig. Noodles were extremely oily, it was the same noodle for every bowl. You will die from thirst after finishing this bowl of ramen. Spicy Tonkotsu $16 - Not spicy. Oily noodles. Free Edamame for checking in on Yelp. We all agreed that we had better Japanese ramen elsewhere.",0
3423,"I was so excited to try this place because I love crepes! It's a small shop with very steep stairs leading upward to a small seating area where you can enjoy your dessert. I got The Elvis (Banana, chocolate, and peanut butter crepe). It was ok but had WAY TOO MUCH chocolate and peanut butter in it. So much so that I had to throw more than half of it away because it was too rich. You couldn't even taste the crepe itself. My friend got one too and said hers had too much stuff as well and she couldn't eat it. Most places give too small of portions or topping, here it was way too much. I think if they throttle back a bit they'd be excellent but I don't know that for sure.",0
12157,"A new dollar pizza place in the neighborhood seemed promising but didn't live up to its potential. Let's dive in ...Dollar plain slice (3/5) This is more or less your everyday slice of dollar pizza. Not great, but checks the box for a buck -- and great for the kids who mostly hang out there after school for a bite to eat. Garlic Knots (1/5): These were drentched in oil and looked a little undercooked sitting behind the glass. We got them heated (along with the slices). However, upon taking a bite at home, we were grossed out by the partly cooked knot on the outside and raw on the inside.TL;DR: I'm probably going to spend the extra $2 for Joe's not far away. But for those looking for a cheap slice, it is a dollar piece of pizza",0
17112,"I have no clue why this beautiful, amazing place has such low reviews. It's a shame because I really love this restaurant and I want it to stay well in business so I can return often. I was astonished to see a Pulsd voucher for Pondicheri and immediately snatched it up - in retrospect, I should've bought more. :p I'm happy to pay full-price here, though, because I haven't found food like this anywhere else.For those who are expecting traditional Indian food and are upset by the prices and the creative takes here, this is not for you. There's a niche for good traditional Indian food, and there's a niche for Indian-inspired American food, and Pondicheri fills that beautifully. Try it with no expectations (and no comparisons to traditional South Asian food). I've been here three times now, and I've loved pretty much everything I've gotten. I vaguely remember that the duck was a bit more lean than I would've liked and the quail entree was surprisingly small (barely enough food for my boyfriend) compared to lower-priced thalis (twice as much food as I can eat), but those would be the only criticisms, if even. The complementary corn chips are super addicting, and a really fun touch that I've never seen anywhere else. I love all the thalis that I've gotten, which present surprisingly, intense flavors that complement each other well. I love the chicken 25 in its various forms. I love the avocado pistachio moringa (!) ice cream, though it was really hard the second time we got it. Still incredibly tasty, though :p I love the drinks, ranging from the $3 masala milks to the stunningly delicious nojito (a guava mocktail that took my breath away). I've tried 6 drinks at this point and you absolutely cannot go wrong with any of them. I'm thrilled that this place exists; the ambiance is also gorgeous, and the surprising emptiness means there's never a wait and I'd be able to bring a large group easily. I come here for casual dinners and brunches, but I'd also come here for special occasions with large groups - it's definitely a unique dining experience in NYC.",0
17225,"Title: A Cozy Spot with Delicious Thai Cuisine

We decided to dine here before attending a show, lured by the promising Yelp reviews. Despite its diminutive size, the restaurant exuded a warm and welcoming ambiance. It appears to cater perfectly to couples or pairs, though larger groups might find it a challenge to be accommodated.

Our meal commenced with a refreshing Thai iced tea and savory curry puffs that set a high note for what was to come. The pad thai with shrimp was the standout dish of the evening—simply divine. The beef stir fry also delighted our taste buds with its rich flavors.

In conclusion, this quaint establishment left a lasting impression. It's a definite must-visit for anyone craving Thai cuisine. I'm already looking forward to my next visit.",1
15754,"Title: A Delightful Return to Flavor Town

My husband and I returned to this gem of a restaurant and were charmed once again by the exceptional service and delightful dishes. Our waitress was outstanding, enhancing our dining experience with her attentiveness.

To combat the sweltering heat of a New York summer, we started with drinks; my rosé sangria and his watermelon lemonade were both flavorful and invigorating. Opting for a variety of small plates, we found each selection mostly hit the mark. The watermelon salad was surprisingly substantial and deliciously refreshing. My husband savored the simplicity of his cheeseburger, and the accompanying fries struck a perfect balance of seasoning.

Although the fried pickles were slightly overdone, the accompanying sauce won us over. The cheesesteak egg rolls with their dipping sauce were also a crowd-pleaser. The mac n cheese, however, was the only dish that didn't resonate with our taste buds, a minor blip in an otherwise delightful meal.

Our sweet ending came in the form of a smores dessert, which was a delectable homage to campfire treats with its perfectly crisped marshmallows.

Despite the restaurant's tendency to be a tad dark and boisterous, it only adds to its vibrant atmosphere. A must-visit spot; you're sure to leave pleased.",1
10654,"I recently dined at this expansive eatery during restaurant week and was impressed by the experience, though it's wise to book ahead, as I did. Contrary to Google's listed hours, they were accommodating and seated us 15 minutes before their reopening time. The restaurant week menu didn't feature all the special cuts, but the food bar was a standout with its delicious smoked salmon and sugar spicy bacon. The meat service was frequent, offering roughly 10-15 slices. While mostly cooked to perfection, some cuts were on the saltier side. I'd rate the food 4/5. The service was commendable, and I left quite satisfied. I recommend this place and plan to return for the prime cuts.",1
15900,"Title: High Hopes Dashed During Brunch at [Restaurant Name]

As an avid brunch enthusiast and a fan of value dining, my anticipation for trying [Restaurant Name] was met with disappointment. The initial challenge was navigating the esoteric menu, compounded by staff who struggled to clarify our culinary queries. 

Expecting to be wowed, especially by a go-to favorite like butter chicken, I was instead presented with a lackluster version that lacked the rich flavors I've come to relish in Indian cuisine. Sampling my friends' meals offered little consolation, as none managed to truly captivate my palate.

Despite its charming ambiance, [Restaurant Name] failed to deliver the satisfying experience promised by the glowing reviews of others. I'm left hoping this was an anomaly and not the standard, though there's hesitation in my heart about a return visit.",1
12232,"This place just kinda missed the mark for me. I ordered the chicken dish for pickup and first of all, the spot is stunning. They have these big open windows, plenty of seating, the staff is friendly, the decor is great, and from what I saw in pics, the presentation is beautiful. I can totally see how this place gives a sort of rose-tinted glasses when you eat in. But, for pickup, you see it with its true colors. The dish was good, don't get me wrong. Just overpriced and nothing special. The chicken comes with yogurt, barley, and a cucumber and mint salad. Everything was fresh, but the portions were small and everything was under seasoned. The cucumber would have gone a long way with a bit of salt and the chicken, albeit tender, was cooked very blandly. I didn't get any sort of sesame flavor despite the alleged rub.Portion size is on the smaller side, and I would compare the quality to Dig Inn or The Little Beet at the same approximate price for much bigger portions. I would probably return to dine in, but you have a lot better options for your money for takeout. I just don't get the hype.",0
17377,"Title: A Bowl of Ramen That Whisks You Back to Japan

If you're seeking an authentic ramen experience that rivals those in Japan, look no further. This spot remains at the top of my list, potentially clinching the #1 spot for the best ramen in the city. While the pork and self-cracked soft-boiled egg don't stand out, the broth and noodles transcend the ordinary, making other ingredients seem inconsequential.

On my latest visit, I stayed loyal to my usual order but ramped up the heat to level 4. It packed a punch, yet I’m tempted to brave level 5 next time. Despite regularly debating the necessity of the egg, I keep adding it to my order, though it seems a bit unnecessary.

I usually opt for extra noodles, but considering my wife doesn't finish hers, a half order might suffice in the future – she suggests skipping extra noodles altogether. If you're in search of truly exceptional ramen with a customizable kick, this place won't disappoint.",1
13480,"Great spot for a quick eat or to eat as you walk/driveFood: 4/5: We ordered the beef unda, chicken ticka, and chicken unda rolls. All were good and flavorful. If I were in the area and wanted something quick I would come here again. Service: 4/5: nothing special. You order and pick up your food. Ambiance: 3/5: for a quick serve spot it is nice, but again nothing special.Price: 3/5: a bit higher than I expected but not unreasonable, however I wanted to order a tea but when I saw the price....hellll naw. So disappointed I didn't get to try the tea. Overall, a unique place to get Indian 'fast foods but of a higher quality.",0
12245,"Great simple Asian food. I've never been anywhere that squirts sake at you and it was so fun! Ordered a full menu of foods from chicken hibachi, California roll, salads, soups and Goyza. It was nice to check in and get 15 percent off our bill!",0
18820,"Title: Tasty Encounter at Katsu-Hama

My visit to Katsu-Hama was an enjoyable one, filled with the vibrant flavors I've come to expect from a katsu-focused eatery. The dishes served here undoubtedly tantalize the taste buds, yet when drawing a comparison with its nearby rival, Tonkatsu Matsunoya, Katsu-Hama doesn't quite take the crown.

The portion sizes at both establishments are comparable, but Matsunoya's Pork Tonkatsu steals the show with a more pronounced and satisfying flavor profile that truly hits the mark. Moreover, Matsunoya offers a bit more value for money—while a B-Set pork tenderloin don at Katsu-Hama will set you back an additional dollar or two, pricing at around $16-17, Matsunoya keeps the budget slightly more in check.

Despite the close competition with another katsu specialist in the vicinity, Katsu-Hama has certainly impressed with its offerings. However, for those like myself who seek the ultimate tonkatsu experience at a friendlier price, Matsunoya remains the go-to destination.",1
17865,"Visiting NYC, my friends and I obviously wanted Italian food! This was our first time in the city so we had no idea where to go but came to Don Giovanni's on recommendation of a friend. What a nice place to dine! It's right in the city, close to Times Square. The prices are median, not too expensive but not cheap. They give you great portions, too. We all shred garlic knots and mozzarella sticks. Let me tell you, they do HOT skimp on the garlic for the knots. They were soft and delicious. The mozzarella sticks were super flavorful and cheesy. I ordered the pesto, which was creamy and delicious. The only thing I didn't like about it was that I got chicken in it and they dice up the chicken and put it throughout the pasta. I would've rather it be in slices and on top. My two friends got Alfredo which was really good and a huge portion, another friend got the huge, cheesy hero and my other friend got Marsala (I think). I will say, the people next to us ordered pizza and it looked incredible!!We all honestly enjoyed our meals and the service was great! The inside was super cool looking, with pictures all over the walls like a true Italian home. I would recommend this place for a decent meal!",0

16934,"After reading about this spot in a must-see NYC guide, I arrived with high expectations. Surprisingly, the crowd was thinner than anticipated. However, the 'affordable' prices listed weren't as budget-friendly as I'd been led to believe—fairly standard for New York, really. As for the food, it was ample yet required a bit of seasoning, a dash of salt and pepper to truly come alive. Service-wise, the staff didn't exude much enthusiasm, adding a note of indifference to the dining experience. Take note: it's a cash-only establishment, so prepare accordingly. All in all, a decent visit but not the standout I had hoped for.",1

12398,"I recently tried Korean Express for the first time and found it to be a great spot for an easy and quick lunch. I opted for the tuna kimbap but found it a bit heavy on the mayo, which overpowered the dish, leaving me wishing there were more vegetables included. Health-conscious diners might prefer the vegetable kimbap as a lighter alternative. Despite this, the flavors have intrigued me enough to consider a return visit to explore more of their Korean cuisine, especially when those cravings hit or if I'm in the area again.",1
14954,"The only reason I came here was because I saw it on an episode of Sex and The City...   grilled cheese was alright. The raspberry Mojito was okay. However, the real star of the show was the Mac & cheese egg rolls. I could eat 16 plates of them. To be honest if I was on death row the mac & cheese egg rolls would be my chosen last meal. The ambiance is magnificent.. I like it. The bathroom is nice too.",0
20315,"I came when it first opened and the lines out the street level were extremely long however there was another entrance inside Hudson Yards that is not noticeable until you walk down a flight of stairs on the main level. This had a shorter line wait. This space reminded me a bit of Dekalb Market Hall in Brooklyn since there are multiple stalls of food to choose from and it is also situated downstairs. It is very dim inside, I wish it was slightly brighter as it is already located on the basement level.I like the range of different food options, all are tapa style and great if you're looking to share some small plates or just there to try a range of food. I came here for a small snack and was drawn to the fresh hot churros. A lot of the stalls are open for viewing which was neat to see the food being made.",0
11320,"I recently visited a local eatery with the intention of enjoying a lobster roll. While the roll itself met my expectations, the experience was marred by the service. Despite having a reservation for 6:15 PM, my party was not seated until after 6:30, which was our first disappointment.

The interaction with the staff didn't help matters. Each time we expressed our gratitude, the uniform response was ""no problem,"" a phrase that, to my ear, lacks the professionalism of a ""you're welcome"" or ""my pleasure."" This may seem trivial to some, but it struck a discordant note with me, enough so that my companions and I found ourselves bemusedly discussing it even after our departure.

The casual demeanor of the wait staff suggests a training issue that could easily be rectified to enhance the dining experience. Unfortunately, this detail, along with the wait, detracted from the overall ambiance, leading me to decide against returning. For those seeking a superior lobster roll experience – both in meal and service – I'd recommend trying Lukes instead.",1
13859,Nachos are so good you forget there's no cheese. They're loaded with no chip left behind. Ambience is super cute either for a date or dinner with friends.

With dollar Blue Point oysters, $5 drafts, and complimentary house-made chips, this spot offers unbeatable value in an area known for pricier fare. The quality of the oysters is remarkable for the price, and the ambiance is enhanced by the stylish decor and convivial staff who add a personal touch by remembering the regulars. The positive energy is infectious and promises a great dining experience. I'm already planning my next visit to indulge in a full meal. A must-try for happy hour enthusiasts!",1
1541,"Don't know why this is 3.5 stars. It's my favorite neighborhood gem for quality Italian food with cheap prices! Great for casual lunch on the UWS.

20251,"Title: Modest Dumpling Fare with a Twist

I recently stopped by this local spot with a hankering for dumplings and found myself with mixed feelings. The pan-fried dumplings were decent; I appreciated the light char that gave them a nice texture without being overly fried. They're serviceable if you're nearby and craving a dumpling fix.

The dumpling of the month, an intriguing chicken with green mole sauce, unfortunately fell flat, coming across more like pork or chorizo with the individual flavors lost in a muddled blend. On the upside, the reinvented classic dumplings did hit the mark on taste, and the garlic crushed cucumber salad was a simple yet satisfying side.

Beverage-wise, their unsweetened blueberry iced tea had potential but was overshadowed by the overly sweet lemonade. Combining the two for a makeshift blueberry Arnold Palmer toned down the sweetness slightly, but I suspect the blueberry iced tea is better enjoyed alone.

Overall, it's a mixed bag: some hits, some misses, and a little pricey, but if you're in the area and dumplings are calling your name, it might just do the trick.",1

11475,"My experience at this restaurant on their All-You-Can-Eat (AYCE) mussels Sunday, priced at $29 (also available on Mondays if you believe other reviews), was delightful. The Thailandaise mussels, my initial concern for being overly creamy, struck a perfect balance with their broth, offering a superb flavor without overpowering the dish. Though the first serving was generous, subsequent pots seemed to dwindle in size. The BXL variant was tasty, and finishing with the lighter mariniere was a wise choice after indulging in the others. The inclusion of Stella and piping hot fries complemented the mussels splendidly. Service was attentive and efficient; our waitress kept our water glasses filled without pause, and the staff was quick to clear empty shells. Overall, a great spot for mussel enthusiasts.",1
19297,"One of many places in Ktown, this place was recommended by a friend for their high quality food and service. As we expected a long wait, we were surprised it was only 15 minutes during peak Saturday dinner. The only downside is that we were told to wait outside in below zero Celsius weather inside one layer of the restaurant, which is just slightly warmer than that. Once we got seated, we got 5 complimentary side dishes with unlimited refills, which is great because the banchan here is far superior than the other banchan in a standard Korean restaurant. Some of the highlights are pork, bok choy, and dried fish. You rarely, if ever, get meat/non vegetarian banchan with unlimited refills. After that, we ordered the large pork belly dish as well as the pork ribs. Ironically, the pork belly dish came before the small plate/appetizer pork ribs, but it was fine. The pork belly was above average, but it was still not as great as the melt in your mouth texture ones I have tried at a low-end Michelin star restaurant for a similar price. There is a plum sauce and a garlic sauce, which are both great options to dip or load up on in the pork belly. The pork ribs are marinated quite well, though I honestly felt like the pork in the side dish is a bit better in texture, while the pork ribs are more flavorful. We split both of these dishes with 3 people and were very full at the end.Service is definitely a big plus here. It's pretty easy to flag down a server and get your requests fulfilled. Sometimes we don't tell them and they just help us get what we needed, like water refills and prompt turnaround in side dishes refills. This definitely distinguishes from other Korean restaurants elsewhere in Ktown, which further justifies a slightly higher price point in this place. As I overheard someone while waiting for the table, ""wow the wait here is so much shorter here. Everyone is eating next door because it's cheap, but they don't know about the good places like this."" Yup true.",0
14194,"Title: A Classic NY Slice at Joe's

If you're seeking the quintessential New York pizza experience, a visit to Joe's is practically mandatory. My inaugural meal in the Big Apple, a stone's throw from my hotel, did not disappoint. Joe's offered just what I was after: a quick, delightful bite.

I dropped by Joe's twice, the allure of pizza for breakfast proving irresistible. Sampling the white pizza, supreme, fresh mozzarella, and an adventurous white pizza topped with broccoli, each slice hit the spot. The broccoli-topped version, a recommendation from a local friend, was an unexpected twist—toppings on after baking—making for a curious yet veggie-rich breakfast.

Joe's service shone through with its friendliness and efficiency—a straightforward process of choosing, paying, and enjoying your pizza without any fuss. While Joe's might be a standout pizzeria in any other city, it's comfortably above average in the competitive New York scene. And that's no faint praise—Joe's proves that even New York's ""above average"" can outshine the best elsewhere.",1

20282,"Title: Authentic Street-Style Tacos in the Heart of New York

If you're on a quest for the most authentic street-style tacos in New York, look no further! The highlight here is undoubtedly the adobada tacos - flawlessly seasoned and cooked to perfection. Be decisive with your order; opting for five tacos right off the bat is the smart move to avoid a second wait in what can be quite a line. But don't let the queue intimidate you; efficiency is part of the dining experience as it moves briskly.

Ordering is straightforward: choose your tacos, pay, then hand your receipt to the chefs who will customize your order with a choice of corn or flour tortillas and a generous range of toppings. One minor surprise is the single tortilla per taco, diverging from the double layer commonly found elsewhere.

The eatery is cozy with standing room - a testament to its popularity - but patience pays off as tables turn over quickly. Prices might be a notch higher than in Southern California, but for an undeniable taco fix, this spot is a must-visit in the city.",1
12343,"The decoration was beautiful. It feels like you entered a whole new world. But it's so busy, we can barely squeeze in the door and the wait was long. We came twice but gave up the first time. the second time we decided to stay because it was later the night and the wait wasn't too bad. When we were seated, we were so close to the table next to us and felt so uncomfortable having to listen to other people's conversations or having ours being heard. We were talking about anything inappropriate but it felt like our personal space has been invaded. Additionally, the works there was rushing us to order and different people came to our table multiple times to ask us how was our food and if we need to order drinks as they don't have a mutual understanding of who's serving which table. We appreciate the attentiveness but it was a little too much. The food tasted amazing. The sparerib on sugar cane was great and you can even taste the flame ( not spicy but the charcoal taste ). That being said, there's not a lot of meat on there and getting charged for $10 is a little bit of a rip off. We ordered two other dishes, pad see eww and some meat and rice dish but it doesn't top the spareribs.",0
16284,"This is a great vegetarian, kosher and gluten free friendly Chinese/dim sum restaurant in a relatively hidden but busy street of Chinatown. I've come here twice on the weekends and was seated immediately both times. The restaurant is very spacious, but tables are close to each other.  There is a substantial amount of fake meat on the menu, and I was surprised by how good they tasted. I highly recommend getting the BBQ pork dish. I also tried the general tso's vegetarian chicken, which was also surprisingly delicious. The menu is huge, so there is truly something for everyone. For the less adventurous, there are always lo mein and fried rice dishes. Everything is super flavorful, and portion sizes are good.",0

We arrived on time but had to wait for 10 min because the table is not ready.When they led us to the table, it was a small dark corner near the aisle. There are empty table near the window. The food is mediocre and the service  is subpar. The the sauce is extremely salty. The people at front desk are cold and lack energy. The server all looked like they hate their jobs. The whole ambience is just not pleasant. I have  better experience else where and have no desire to be back to this sad  and arrogant trump building.",0
19204,"Came here on a Thursday night for dinner with my gf and what I expected was blown out of proportions. This restaurant may look closed or under construction, but they are open despite the deceiving looks from the scaffoldings.We were seated very promptly and greeted by all of the waitstaff as we were directed to our seats. We were given the rundown of how to order and were on our merry way to order. A person will have to get three different plates, one from each section on the menu while the last section is a la carte. So for the two of us, we got six plates. They did tell us that if we didn't want to do it this way that we could sit at the bar area and order everything a la carte without the minimum restriction.Here's what we got from each section:YellowTailBeef TartareSunchokePork & ShrimpOctopusPork BellyThe food was amazing. From the first plate they served us, we were both pretty surprised at how good it tasted. Every plate had its own unique taste to it and made to perfection. By the time we were done with our sixth plate, we were both surprisingly full. For the quality and quantity of a tapas restaurant, three plates for $46 per person is a pretty good deal. The meal also comes with rice. We chose to get one seaweed rice for an extra $2 to try out and was worth it. We also got seaweed crackers at the beginning of our meal which were a tasty snack. Highly recommend this very underrated restaurant.",0
1045,"Title: A Hidden Gem with a Comfortable Vibe

Stumbling upon this charming restaurant was a delightful surprise during my stroll. The establishment boasts a pleasant outdoor seating area and emits a welcoming, laid-back atmosphere that immediately puts you at ease.

Opting for a quick lunch, the service did not disappoint. The waitress proved to be both helpful and attentive, enhancing the dining experience. The star of the meal was the short rib sandwich - a tender, flavorful delight, perfectly complemented by a side of fries that hit the mark with just the right amount of crispness and no excess grease.

The one downside was the eerily dark hallway leading to the downstairs bathroom. Despite the unsettling approach, I was reassured by the bathroom's spotless condition.

Rounding out the venue's appeal is the on-site bar, contributing to the restaurant's relaxed vibe. A recommendable spot for those seeking good food and a comfortable setting.",1
12944,"I've walked by this place a million times and it always seems packed! Even at 5:30 on a Sunday, almost every table was taken. I decided to get the crispy calamari salad because I had my eye on a large dessert on the dessert menu. The salad was a good size and the calamari was very crispy, exactly the way I like it! I had to order the white chocolate cherry bread pudding, and was not disappointed. YUM!",0
20076,"Wasn't very impressed . Tried 3 different slices and liked only one . That one was the caramelized onion slice . Didn't take a pic as I was too hungry and ate it quickly . It was the right amount of mozzarella cheese and the onions complimented it beautifully . It wasn't as chewy as my second slice, the spinach and artichoke. Flavors just didn't do it for me and tasted like nothing really. The last slice , the grandma I suspect was bad . Terrible sauce and just a terrible slice . I did get here an hour before closing and they had limited options but I do t see myself liking it much more than I did today .",0
20438,I came here during the soft opening. The line was minimal (also have the option of ordering on a kiosk). I ordered the bulgogi bowl. Delicious! Next time I come here I want to get the fries and the Vietnamese iced coffee.,0
10841,"Title: A Serene Respite Next to New York Dress

After a bustling experience at a nearby bar, I found solace at this delightful spot, conveniently situated right next to New York Dress where I had an appointment. The calm and casual ambiance was a welcome change, allowing me to unwind in a setting that struck a perfect balance between outdoor freshness and the comfort of air conditioning, thanks to their open wall design.

The bartender was the epitome of attentiveness and sweetness, adding to the relaxed vibe. While my visit only included a Tito's soda, which was expertly prepared, it was enough to impress. It's not every day you find a simple drink done right, but they nailed it.

The music, enjoyable yet unobtrusive, complemented my solo time as I awaited my friend's arrival. It's rare to find a place that hits all the right notes for a peaceful break in the city. I left feeling content and refreshed—a testament to the establishment's ability to create a small haven amidst the urban hustle. I'm already looking forward to my next visit.",1
15559,"Title: A Memorable Birthday Feast at Loring Place

My partner and I celebrated her birthday with a date night at Loring Place, and the experience was nothing short of fantastic. Eager to sample a variety of dishes, we may have gotten carried away and ordered a bit too much, but it was worth it.

We kicked off our meal with the Baked Ricotta, served warm and paired perfectly with sourdough bread – a delectable start. The roasted beets followed, striking a delightful chord on the palate. For the main course, we indulged in the cheeseburger, complemented by cured bacon and pepper aioli, alongside satisfyingly crispy fries. The ricotta cavatelli was a hit, arriving in a generous portion that was savored to the last bite.

While the grandma-style pan pizza was an aromatic garlic fest which slightly overwhelmed my taste buds, its quality was still notable. Though it didn't quite match up to Emmy Squared's deep dish, it held its own. The meal's crowning glory was the Tres Leches dessert – a light and heavenly finish to our feast.

The service deserves its own accolades, as it was attentive and seamless throughout the evening. Loring Place certainly won us over, assuring our return, and earning a high recommendation for anyone seeking a delightful dining experience.",1
19528,"The wait here is crazy and this place is super super packed. Service is good and quick. Kiwi shochu drink is light and so so addictive! Geso karaage: fried to perfection. Still light and great. Chicken nanban: get it. The end. Kimchi udon: delicious! It's a generous portion. Very creamy and I enjoyed it. Salmon tartare tacos: good! The taco fried portion I think could be thinner since it overwhelmed the salmon for me. Yakitori sampler set: the belly and thigh was good. I think they could have given more shishito peppers. The chicken breast was a bit dry. Tuna tartare bomb: it came highly recommend. It's good, but not my favorite. Philly roll: tried it on a whim. I still think cream cheese is a big sushi no no. Special mew roll: also highly recommended. I'd pass.",0
18519,"In December of 2018, I stumbled upon this quaint restaurant on a weeknight and was pleasantly surprised to snag a table without a wait, despite the bustling holiday season. I started with the Tuna Tartare which was decent, though not exceptional. My main course, a filet ordered medium-rare, unfortunately arrived leaning more towards medium and was just okay. However, the star of the meal was undoubtedly the Brussels sprouts; served with a scrumptious bacon and cider glaze, they were by far the finest I've ever enjoyed. Despite the minor setbacks, those Brussels sprouts alone make a return visit a tempting proposition.",1
11893,"This is by far my favorite spot for breakfast. I recommend coming here closer to their opening time considering the wait time. We come on a Friday morning to avoid it. The food is delicious always fresh and the waiters are very attentive. My usual is the burekas brunch meal and I never finish it, but it is sooooo delicious. We sometimes get the lamb sausage on the side, hummus or potato pancake. I'm not crazy about the pancake but everything else is amazing. I rate this spot 10/10. If you don't like something they will change it and offer you something else ( my husband didn't like the coffee so they offered a mocha latte and he said it was amazing ) great decor, great food and awesome vibe :)",0
10130,"I had a delightful impromptu dinner at a cozy French bistro in Harlem and was thoroughly impressed. From the wine selections to the classic appetizers like escargot and foie gras, each dish was executed with finesse. The octopus was tender and flavorful, and the duck entrée we shared was the highlight of our culinary journey. The dessert, though savory, came with a slight letdown as the anticipated passionfruit in the Ile Flottante was swapped with mango without notice. Despite this, the quality of the meal justified the price tag of around $130 before tip. I recommend visiting before sunset and dining alfresco if the weather welcomes it. This charming spot has the potential to be your next ""rendezvous"", provided they keep you informed of menu changes!",1

12166,"Title: Late-Night Ramen Bliss at Tatsu Ramen

If you're prowling the streets of New York with a growling stomach any time before 5 AM on a weekend, Tatsu Ramen is the answer to your cravings. This popular ramen joint, which also serves until 2 AM on weekdays, is a haven for night owls seeking solace in a bowl of noodles.

Our numerous experiences with Tatsu Ramen, although exclusively through Uber Eats, were far from disappointing. The infamous ""cheeky ramen"" lived up to its reputation. On our first attempt to order, it was sold out, which only heightened our anticipation. When we finally got our hands on the pork cheeky ramen the next night, it didn't last long. The broth was a revelation – rich, boldly flavored, and irresistible to the last drop. Though it was enjoyed as takeout, one can only dream of how much better it might taste fresh from the kitchen.

The organic tofu gluten-free cheeky ramen, ordered by my wife, had well-seasoned tofu and commendable gluten-free noodles, though the $6 upcharge was a point of contention. We also indulged in the pork chashu rice on two occasions, and it was a hit – the rice, a perfect bed for the savory pork, didn’t miss a chance to impress.

Even as takeout, the care Tatsu Ramen put into packaging was noticeable. The broth was smartly kept separate from the noodles to maintain their integrity. While I can't comment on the dine-in experience, if their delivery is anything to go by, Tatsu Ramen is a standout in New York's ramen scene.",1
13893,"I recently stopped by this spot for a quick bite, opting for their empanadas to-go. Priced at around $4 each, the empanadas were decent, though I found them a tad small for the cost. Service efficiency was a plus with a swift turnaround time. The shrimp-filled empanada, when paired with the accompanying salsa, was a highlight — truly savory. However, the shredded chicken empanada fell a bit short, coming across as somewhat dry. Overall, it's a mixed bag: you'll find some tasty options, just be prepared for the portion to price ratio.",1
15353,"I am happy with what I ordered:I had the Foie gras Tortellini in Brodo - this are little raviolIs with foie gras which k could taste.  They pour in broth which  is like  consommé over 5 little raviolis.  Very good bUt I wish they gave a little bit more than 5 tiny ones.My main course was excellent!

14175,"Title: A Satisfying Vegan Surprise at Sunrise Delights

I recently dined at Sunrise Delights and was pleasantly surprised by their scrumptious vegan offerings. The ""Morning Sunrise"" turned out to be a burrito, which was unexpectedly tasty, featuring a robust spicy vegan chorizo. Despite a touch too much oil and tofu that was unevenly distributed, the flavors stood out. 

The quinoa hash brown was another highlight, with a delightful texture complemented by subtle tofu sour cream. Dipping it into the homemade chipotle sauce added a fiery punch that was most welcome. 

The star of the meal, however, was the avocado pesto pasta. One taste and I was exclaiming, ""Dang, vegan food is amazing."" The warmth of the dish and the innovation of cashew pesto, paired with bursts of freshness from cherry tomatoes, made for a memorable experience. 

In addition to the flavors, the affordability and portion sizes left me feeling both satisfied and impressed. Sunrise Delights certainly knows how to serve up vegan food that pleases the palate and the wallet.",1

The sight of their extensive menu filled with mouth-watering Greek snacks made me wish I had arrived with a heartier appetite or a group to sample more of their offerings. The atmosphere was inviting and the dishes, as far as I could tell, promised a delicious experience. I eagerly anticipate my next visit to explore the menu further.

1787,"Title: A Haven for Sauce Lovers and Veggie Enthusiasts

If you’re a fan of all-you-can-eat (AYCE) dining and a plethora of sauce options, this hot pot restaurant might just tickle your fancy. The place boasts a truly impressive sauce bar brimming with variety, ensuring every palate finds its match, although the sauces are admittedly not homemade. Their hot pot sauce selection includes an interesting tomato sauce which, while a tad less acidic than ideal, is still a welcome addition for those who crave diversity in their dips.

The real highlight for me wasn’t the meat, which was fairly average—both the beef and lamb were just okay and didn’t really stand out. Instead, the extensive array of vegetables and the standout seafood pancake stole the show. The pancake was a delightful surprise, with its chewy texture that deviates from the usual doughy consistency. The vegetable options were also noteworthy, offering everything from frozen tofu to winter melon and fungus, making it a paradise for those who revel in greens and an assortment of small eats.

In summary, this spot is a dream for those who love mixing and matching an array of sauces and feasting on a diverse selection of veggies and seafood. Meat lovers might find it less appealing, but for anyone with a penchant for AYCE variety, this hot pot place is certainly worth a visit.",1
18221,"I finally visited a spot I'd bookmarked since it was mentioned on the Serious Eats podcast, and it didn't disappoint. The pizza here boasts a crackery crust reminiscent of Rubirosa's or Joe & Pat's, though not as thinly executed. The sauce and cheese met expectations, but the pepperoni stole the show - truly excellent. While Joe's, just a short walk away, might still be my top pick, this place is a solid alternative, especially when Joe's is bursting at the seams.",1
17885,"An accurate rating by the Yelp community: 3.5 starsLiving in LA for several years, I always heard such good things about Catch, the atmosphere and food seemed so photo worthy. So when we dined at Catch NYC, I was pretty excited. After our dinner bill for 4 people ran north of $500 and I was still hungry, Catch NYC left me feeling slightly underwhelmed. The host staff and our waitress all acted like entitled employees who couldn't even remember our name upon check-in (it wasn't even busy). Our waitress rushed us on every dish and didn't make the experience enjoyable at all. The overall atmosphere of the dining area is okay, its a very maritime/costal vibe - nothing impressive, or photo worthy. Their bar area, however was a little cuter with black and white flooring.Among the dishes I do recommend:-the lobster mac & cheese: one of the bigger sized portions, excellent flavor, and decent chunks of lobster-toro tartare: fresh topped with caviar and paired with crackers, so delicious, but small-The Carnival dessert: ricotta donuts DONE RIGHT. This is an absolute must, paired with 3 different flavored syrups. OMG - its good.*DO NOT GET the ceviche, they do not know how to make ceviche. The taste was flavorless, lacked fish and served mostly with tangerine slices. Not authentic and not a good fusion at all.These weren't even all the dishes we ordered, just the memorable ones. Overall, Catch is overpriced for the food quality and experience (or rather lack of). Yes, I enjoyed my company and the music playing was good, but I don't think I would recommend this restaurant to friends visiting New York.",0

I guess I'm spoiled by the way I make my Sangria and were its been done well at very few places. This place is fun, it's hip and it's loud. It's the perfect after work spot for some happy hour drinks. I had some cheap $5 tequila shots and a glass of white sangria,$5 as well. It's a really long space with tables and chairs.

19119,"Title: A Decent Slice in the Big Apple

I recently visited a well-recommended pizzeria in New York, hailed by a friend as superior to the famous Lucali. Eager to put this claim to the test, I took an out-of-town guest to see if it lived up to the hype.

The tomato pizza did impress us, boasting a robust flavor that danced delightfully on the palate. However, the white sauce pizza fell short of our expectations, missing that same pizzazz. To our delight, we were treated to a complimentary dessert, which was a sweet ending to our meal - both figuratively and literally.

Unfortunately, the experience was slightly marred by a delay despite our reservation, as we were made to wait 25 minutes before being seated. For a New York dining experience, this may not be uncommon, but it can detract from the overall enjoyment.

In summary, while the tomato pizza and dessert hit the high notes, the service hiccup and an underwhelming white pizza mean I can't quite give it full marks. Still, it's a strong contender in the New York pizza scene, earning a solid 4 out of 5 stars from me.",1

I love dosa and that was the part I was looking forward to the most but the dough was too thick and not cripsy. The masala mix in the middle was incredibly bland, even the chutneys and soup it came with didn't add much flavor. For the appetizers, I did like the veggie sambusa and papadum, in addition to the garlic naan. The aloo gobi was ok, but nothing to write home about. I have a decent spice tolerance and the medium level was perfect. The restaurant space is very small, so you'll likely have to wait for a table or get takeout. The staff was friendly and accommodating with giving us more table space when all our food came. I hope they can improve on their dosa soon!",0

We started with a hummus appetizer paired with crispy pita chips, a delectable beginning that set the stage for the meal ahead. The calamari stood out as a personal favorite, the addition of jalapeños providing a welcome kick. Alongside this, the truffle fries were the perfect comfort food, hitting all the right notes.

11873,"I've been frequenting Vapiano since my college years whenever I was craving a casual bite of tasty pasta, but admittedly started visiting a bit less as I became able to afford better places with decent service, in addition to there are more options in the area. The kicker being two Christmases ago, one of the cashier gave me a hard time when I tried to redeem a Yelp offer for ice tea. I mean come on guys, that's not the best aftertaste to end an otherwise good meal!My last visit, however, did impress me. First, it looks like they figured out how to neatly form a line at the pasta stations, I mean really! It used to be an insane free-for-all battle just to get your order in. An even better improvement might be to wrap around a second layer, preferably without blocking the bathroom hall.Second, there are a few more choices on the menu, and the menu looks clean and easy to read. The new offerings all look good as well! I do think I've heard that the consequences of the menu change is less customization, but the pasta chef who cooked up my order did an excellent job and was generous with the bread.Lastly, the service was far better than I remember! We were sitting by the lounge-ish area and one of the workers would frequently come check up on everyone there and took care of things if anything came up. Very quick and friendly!As for recommendations, the Carbonara or Chicken Alfredo is always solid if you need something filling. The ravioli con ricotta e spinaci I remember being great too, and I asked for them to make it spicy last time I had it. The pizzas aren't too shabby if you're really craving it, although maybe a bit pricy, small, and has few toppings. The baked lasagne was pretty good too. Tomato soup here is great too, especially during the winter.For the desserts, their chocolate mousse is my favorite. Their tiramisu is okay too, tastes strongly of alcohol so may be more popular for the college crowd.Hope Vapiano keeps up the good work!",0

Once we were ready, she had the chef come over and explain the menu to us (the types of pizza dough they have) very helpful! I had the classic margherita on multigrain dough and it was perfect.

11029,"I've stumbled upon my new go-to Ramen spot in NYC and it's a revelation. A friend's Snapchat led me down this noodle-laden path and what a journey it's been. My experience kicked off on a breezy Wednesday evening at 7 PM, where the absence of a crowd meant we were seated immediately – a rarity in the city that never sleeps.

Diving into the mega Koku Ramen, each spoonful was a symphony of savory delights. The meat was plentiful, practically cascading over the bowl, while the broth felt like a warm embrace from an old friend. The pork, oh the pork, was a masterpiece of melt-in-your-mouth perfection, with fat so tender and a flavor so profound, it was culinary euphoria.

To top it off, a complimentary chicken karage, thanks to our Yelp check-in, added just the right crispy contrast to our noodle nirvana. This place isn't just a ramen restaurant; it's a flavor destination that's captured both my palate and my heart.",1

My latest visit to The Boil has only solidified its spot at the top of my seafood restaurant list! Our server, Jenny, was a gem—her insightful recommendations and handy tutorials for shellfish eating were invaluable for our seafood adventure.

Despite being only my second time here (I'm kicking myself for not coming sooner!), I'm tempted to turn this into a weekly ritual. The atmosphere on a Friday night is exactly what you'd want: energetic and down-to-earth, with a playlist that keeps the mood buzzing.

The snow crab legs were the star of the evening—flavorful, perfectly cooked, and at $28/lb, remarkably generous. Sharing fries and mac 'n cheese with friends, we reached peak satisfaction without breaking the bank.

And let's talk drinks—the spicy margarita deserves its own fan club. After two rounds, I'm convinced it's a must-try for any tequila aficionado. 

In short, The Boil is a triumph. Great food, fantastic service, and excellent value. Go for the crab legs, stay for the margaritas, and definitely make it a repeating event in your calendar!",1

11518,"We had another terrific evening at this gem of a restaurant, sampling a variety of specials. The grilled shrimp with garlic and white wine was exquisite, a perfect blend of flavors. Returning to rekindle past dining pleasures, we found the experience consistently excellent. The octopus was tender and flavorful, the bisque rich and satisfying. Complementing the superb cuisine, the service was impeccable and the ambiance inviting. Highly recommended for a delightful meal.",1
12914,"My fiance and I came here on the Saturday night before St. Paddy's day, and Kaikagetsu was like an oasis of tranquility and classiness in the middle of a rowdy street! We came in for an 8pm reservation, and there were only one or two other dining parties there. It felt like we had the whole place to ourselves!We got the $120pp Bishu nabe course. Originally, we were going to get the $80pp Kai course, because the last time we got the higher price kaiseki course (at Naoki Takahashi) we ended up being uncomfortably full at the end. However, our server ensured us that the portion sizes were very reasonable, so we just went for it! For apps, we got marinated tofu (which reminded me of the fermented tofu that you might eat with rice porridge), burdock root and pickled radish & carrot (classic), marinated white fish and salmon with onions, and aged fish egg (I think mentaiko). The marinated fish was our favorite part, though I do think the salmon was slightly redundant, as we were served it again later into the course.Next, our sashimi platter came out. We got 2pc chuutoro, 2pc amberjack, and 2pc of another white fish that I can't quite recall (firm flesh). The sashimi was pretty good but not mind-blowing, which is fair for a kaiseki place that doesn't claim to specialize in sushi. Our main concern with this course was that the wasabi was strangely bland - no matter how much of it we piled on, we simply could not taste nor feel it. We love wasabi, so we were a little weirded out/disappointed by that.After the sashimi, we were presented with our next course - teriyaki grilled salmon with a bamboo shoot. My fiance noted that my piece of salmon was much thicker than his and seemed to be a different part of the fish (looks and taste-wise). Both were tasty.Snow-crab croquettes with tartar sauce came next. The croquette was very crispy on the outside and piping hot and creamy on the inside. Good crab flavor. Also came with shredded cabbage, which is classic for fried dishes, and a little lotus chip. Finally, the star of the course came - the hida beef nabe. We each got two large, think slices of the hida beef, and our own personal hot pots on a little stove. The meat was great - a little lighter and less meaty in flavor than Kobe beef. Both of us absolutely loved the broth, which has a light seafood flavor. They also provided us with a green pepper sauce that was wonderfully savory and acted as a perfect compliment to the hida beef. Our hot pots also included tofu, spring onions, a variety of mushrooms, clear noodles, crown daisy (?), ~4 small scallops (?), and flakes of crab meat. Usually when we get nabe or sukiyaki in a course meal, we don't finish everything inside, but this time we did!Our last savory course was 3pc of hida beef sushi, including one gunkan maki with smaller chunks of the raw beef topped with what looked like a raw quail egg, a raw beef nigiri, and a slightly cooked beef nigiri with scallions. All were excellent, but I would say that the gunkan maki was a little big for our mouths and took us a little while to masticate completely...Finally - dessert! I don't know if they overheard us talking or if we simply got lucky, but we were served red bean taiyaki for dessert! Taiyaki is one of my fiance's favorite sweets. We also got a firm panna cotta and a vanilla pudding, along with hot cups of tea. The taiyaki and pudding were very cute and were an interesting juxtaposition to the ""fancier"" parts of the meal, since both taiyaki and pudding are common/cheap desserts in Japan. It kind of left us with a nice homey feeling. Overall, we really enjoyed eating at Kaikagetsu! The service was fantastic and we will be back.Maybe one day we will stop by to try the hida beef curry, which is only $24!",0
17482,"Title: Sweet Spot for Toffee Pudding

We popped into the restaurant with a single-minded goal: dessert. While we didn't sample the main menu, the swift service deserves commendation. However, a word of caution: the acoustics, amplified by tile walls, make for a noisy atmosphere that challenges table conversation.

The true star of our visit was the sticky toffee pudding—undeniably deserving of accolades and easily the highlight of the dessert menu. On the flip side, the Rhubarb pie didn't quite hit the mark, coming across as disappointingly tough. The ""Quarter pounders"" - ostensibly indulgent chocolate chip cookies paired with ice cream - proved just adequate, with better alternatives likely available elsewhere.

In essence, make a beeline for the toffee pudding if you're in the neighborhood, and you're bound to leave on a sweet high note.",1
12442,"Came by after a night of drinks for some wings and this place did not disappoint. Ordered 10 pieces of garlic parm, 20 pieces of the house special buffalo wings (medium spicy) and waffle fries with a side of cheese. The waffle fries came out fairly quickly and were so good! Love the crisp of the fries and softness of the potato inside. The wings took about 15 minutes to come out. The garlic parm could have been a little more garlicy but still tasty. The medium house special buffalo wings were actually quite spicy that it left a burning sensation on my lips, but I enjoyed them nonetheless! Our waitress was also very friendly and welcoming. Overall a great spot for late night munchies and quiet enough to share a good conversation.",0
19284,"Title: A Delightful Visit to Sprinkles for the Annual Cupcake Tradition

I recently went on my annual pilgrimage for a complimentary birthday cupcake at Sprinkles, a ritual I look forward to each year. Eager to find a closer spot, I turned to Yelp in hopes of discovering a new location nearer to my home. However, I was dismayed to find that my previous review and beloved photos for the Sprinkles at Brookfield had mysteriously disappeared. Nevertheless, this hiccup didn't detract from the experience that awaited.

Sprinkles holds a special place in my heart, not just for me but also as an entertainment spot for visiting friends and relatives. It's become a tradition – a delightful way to cap off a day of exploring the city. Picking a cupcake flavor at Sprinkles is always a sweet challenge, as I have at least five favorites that I juggle between. Regrettably, the cookies I tried didn't leave much of an impression; it seems cupcakes are Sprinkles' true calling.

Despite the small letdown with the cookies, Sprinkles continues to be a go-to for a guaranteed treat, especially after a long day's walk. It's the kind of place that rarely disappoints and where making a choice is the only dilemma you'll face – quite the tasty dilemma to have.",1
15987,"My friend and I decided to try out this restaurant on a Sunday night and were met with a reasonable 25-minute wait. However, the wait outside was a bit of an inconvenience. I opted for an omelette with potato pancakes, which, while satisfactory, didn't stand out from what you might find at a local diner. My companion, on the other hand, enjoyed her vegetable soup and stuffed cabbage, praising the comfort and authenticity of the dishes. We're both curious about the dumplings and traditional soups for a future visit, perhaps a bit earlier in the evening. Service was commendable for its efficiency and attentiveness.",1

The service was excellent and the drinks were exceptional! We both had the frozen margarita and shared the Guacamole and chips - the guacamole is great! Please keep the guac recipe just as it is! The menu was limited due to the fact that the restaurant has not officially opened yet, but I am definitely excited to come back and try additional menu items.Definitely glad we stopped by and I look forward to coming back after the May 14 to try more items.Welcome to the neighborhood Ritas and keep up the great work:)",0
2971,"When my friends ask ""What's ONE meal you can live off for the rest of your life?"" Soondubu is a no-brainer answer for me.This may as well be a love letter to tofu stew but alas, it's thanks to BCD Tofu house way back in the LA location and now NY that comforts my soul. I haven't found another soondubu place that delivers the same level of heat and flavor. This review is purely for the Mixed soondubu with Dangerous level spicy. It's painful enough afterward, but I love the thickness of the stew and slowing down to fight the increasing heat with side dishes. Shout out to my friend J for getting dangerous with me and going through 3 platters of kimchi. There's nothing more culinarily prestigious than sweet kimchi to cool your scorching tongue! Thank you tofu, thank you BCD. Plus their soondubu starter packs at Hmarts are honorable mentions and make for a fast at-home meal.",0
15167,"I recently visited the newly opened Shinagawa and was greeted with an array of opening promotions that enhanced the dining experience. The $12 sake bottles, complimentary appetizer course with miso, and a free dessert for checking in were a delightful touch.

The menu featured dishes that were fresh and flavorful, particularly the Hamachi sashimi which was outstandingly buttery and lived up to its ""amazing"" reputation, despite some confusion among the staff regarding its type. The Hamachi yuzu on the menu was also enjoyable, although its sauce leaned on the saltier side.

Among the three appetizers I tried, the fried clam stood out with its tasty batter. The shrimp, while fresh, required some effort to deshell, which is a minor setback when expecting a relaxing meal.

The meal concluded with a complimentary sweet potato roll dessert. It was pleasantly good, not overwhelmingly sweet, and offered a healthier end to the meal, in true Japanese fashion. While those with a sweet tooth may find it subtle in sweetness, it provided a fitting end to the meal.

Overall, Shinagawa offers a promising dining experience with their fresh dishes and generous promotions.",1
20924,"I recently dined at Rahi and it was a delightful experience that tantalized my taste buds with its modern take on Indian cuisine. The menu was thrilling, filled with innovative twists that made choosing just one dish a real challenge. Presentation is king at Rahi, and they certainly didn't disappoint – each plate was an artful masterpiece.

To complement the meal, the cocktails were a treat, expertly crafted with a unique blend of traditional Indian herbs and spices that invigorated the senses. The food was simply outstanding; it was like rediscovering familiar Indian dishes but with an unmistakably modern flair that made each bite a revelation.

I’m eagerly looking forward to my next visit to Rahi, as there's so much more to explore on their enticing menu. For anyone who appreciates the art of culinary creativity, Rahi is a must-visit destination. Follow my food journey for more updates @traveleen_gurl!",1
17040,"Title: A Cozy Corner with a Hearty Mezze

After much anticipation, my visit to this quaint restaurant lived up to the excitement fueled by a cousin's recommendation. Though our group of three felt rather cramped in a booth that was snugly placed beside another table—curiously so, given the availability of a more spacious option nearby—the ambiance offered a cool, antique charm with its eclectic mix of mismatched plates and ornate rugs.

The culinary highlight without a doubt was the mezze platter; a must-try that dazzled our taste buds while generously satisfying our appetites. While the tunes added to the overall atmosphere, the volume occasionally bordered on overpowering, though it didn't significantly detract from our overall enjoyment.

This restaurant is a solid choice for those looking to indulge in delectable fare amidst a vibe that's both vintage and vibrant.",1
13507,"Title: A Mixed Bag at the Grill Spot

My recent visit to this grille-centric eatery left me with mixed feelings – a solid 3.5 stars overall. Highlights included the delicately sautéed Morning Glory, which was a refreshing counter to the heavier grilled dishes. The Grilled Okra also struck a chord, especially when paired with the savory oyster sauce intended for the Morning Glory.

Seafood offerings like the Prawn were downright delectable, but it was the Vietnamese Steak that stole the show – perfectly marinated and tender to the point of melting in the mouth. For a surprising twist, the Betal Leaf Wrapped Ground Beef offered a delightful break from traditional BBQ flavors with its unique spice blend.

Unfortunately, not all dishes hit the mark. The Charred Uni was a disappointment, served cold with unappetizingly solidified butter. The Short Rib, which I usually adore, fell short due to what seemed like subpar quality or potential overcooking, resulting in a tough and chewy experience. The Oxtail Congee also failed to impress, with its unconventional taste profile not resonating with our palates.

Service was amiable, with a friendly waiter managing several tables and grilling duties all at once – perhaps a bit too stretched to provide impeccable attention. The conclusion of the meal was marred by a slow payment process and a hiccup with an overcharge on alcohol, which added unnecessary time and frustration to the experience.

In summary, while there were definitely some standouts, the expectation for a seamless dining experience fell short in a few areas.",1
15186,"Title: Cozy Accidental Find with Comforting Bites

By a stroke of serendipity, my friend and I stumbled upon Cheese Grille and what a delightful surprise it turned out to be! This gem offers an inviting atmosphere for a casual drink and a menu teeming with comforting food options that impress in quality.

The variety on offer was satisfying, catering to both indulgent whims and cheese-lovers' dreams. Each bite was a testament to the kitchen's commitment to flavorful, easy-going fare.

Sadly, the service didn't match the high standards set by the cuisine - a little on the lackluster side which kept the experience from hitting the pinnacle of a five-star review. 

Despite this, the sheer enjoyment derived from our meal guarantees a return visit the next time we're in the neighborhood. Cheese Grille, you've got repeat customers in us!",1
2221,"Title: Great Food Marred by Unwelcome Guests at Paesano

My visit to Paesano started on a high note with its quaint decor and the option to dine al fresco. The service was outstanding, and the dishes certainly impressed – the vegetarian lasagna was particularly noteworthy, as was the lobster ravioli.

However, my experience was significantly dampened by an encounter with an enormous cockroach on the wall adjacent to my table. To my horror, shortly thereafter, another one made an unwelcome appearance, this time falling onto my lap from beneath the table. While the staff was proactive and handled the situation with apologies and a quick reseating, the incident unfortunately left me on edge for the duration of my meal.

Despite the food's allure, the creepy crawly interruptions are hard to overlook. I can appreciate the swift action taken by the owner and servers, but it was not enough to erase the discomfort that followed. Paesano shows promise, but pest control should be a top priority to ensure diners can enjoy their meals without any nasty surprises. 4/5 stars.",1
16486,"Tucked in the back corner of Food Gallery 32, Noona's may be a bit hidden, but its vibrant TV-screen menus and authentic-looking food models are sure to grab your attention. My visit was rewarded with their Tonkotsu Ramen, a comforting bowl with a creamy, flavorful broth and delightfully chewy noodles. The only letdown was an overcooked boiled egg. A heads-up for the time-crunched: despite its fast-food setting, Noona's—like other stalls in the gallery—can have slower service due to the small kitchen size and usual crowd. Patience is key, but for a satisfying meal without the rush, Noona's is a solid choice.",1
1581,"Just steps away from the Lincoln Center, I stumbled upon a gem that served the best Mexican cuisine my palate has ever savored. The enchiladas, coupled with a side of sumptuous maduros topped with queso fresco and crema, were nothing short of culinary perfection. And the margaritas? Unrivaled, and I speak as a connoisseur with considerable experience. This place did more than just satisfy my cravings — it left me eager for a return visit. A truly exceptional dining experience not to be missed.",1
14987,"Title: A Gem for Sushi Lovers: Maaser

I recently had the pleasure of dining at Maaser, a sushi spot that I can confidently describe as both high-quality and reasonably priced. The ambiance is casual, creating an atmosphere of dining with friends rather than a stuffy, formal setting. It's the epitome of a great, no-frills sushi restaurant.

My friend and I indulged in the 17-course omakase priced at $125 per person, which is quite a bargain compared to other elite sushi establishments. We even treated ourselves to a few extra a la carte items at the end of our meal.

Standouts from the omakase included the seasonal fire squid, the decadently rich king salmon, a meaty live scallop, and both the Hokkaido Uni and botan ebi. Each piece left a lasting impression with its unique and memorable flavors, and the skillful searing on certain items was particularly noteworthy.

While most of the meal was exemplary, there were minor hiccups, such as the rice temperature and the texture of the seaweed. These elements didn’t quite meet the mark, but they were overshadowed by the splendid fish and their complementary seasonings.

The care that goes into every sushi piece is clear, and the chef who attended to us was simply fantastic. His passion for sushi and customer service shined as he enthusiastically explained each dish and maintained a cheerful presence throughout our experience. As the sushi bar is the sole focus here, the interaction with the chef was personal and engaging.

Overall, Maaser is a must-try for anyone seeking excellent sushi without an outrageous price tag. The intimate setting and dedicated attention from the chefs set it apart from busier, less personal alternatives. I'm already looking forward to my next visit to Maaser. Highly recommended!",1
11521,"Bodega Negra has a great vibe and atmosphere perfect for a romantic date or a night with friends! Just make sure you're party all arrives on time because the hostess won't sit you until your party has all arrived. The wine barrels and dim lighting create a very intimate setting. Located in the downtown Dream Hotel it's also a close walk to different lounges, bars or even the always happening PhD club on the rooftop. The food is typical NYC pricey with good flavor. The guacamole was creamy, the soft shell crab tacos were tasty and the drinks were delicious. The pork belly app was a nice portion size but a bit dry without the sauce. I loved the white chocolate lava cake dessert even if I got it just for the Instagram worthy picture. I would come back here again the next time I'm home visiting family.",0
3094,"My family and I popped into this restaurant hoping for a quick and healthy meal, and we weren’t disappointed. Even though the place was bustling, service was prompt and seating was readily available. I opted for the no-meat burger, which was very satisfying. We shared the Mac 'n' cheese but found it unusually sweet due to the sweet potato content, which we didn’t particularly fancy. On the other hand, the salads were a hit with my wife and daughter, leaving them content. Overall, a pleasant dining experience for health-conscious diners on the go.",1
13247,"Clancey had not really been on my radar prior to our visit last weekend, but I'm glad we checked it out. This is a great place to make brunch reservations, first because they actually take reservations, and also the place was not at all full during our visit at the height of Sunday brunchtime (1pm is, I would argue, the golden hour of brunch). We got some things:--The bloodier (bourbon, with the slice of bacon): This was pretty great. I think bourbon always makes for a more interesting-tasting bloody mary, and this version was no exception. The drink included a spicy salt rim that was also somewhat vegetal: I think there were some celery seeds thrown in, too, and maybe one too many for my liking.-Bacon-Wrapped Something (free with the Yelp check-in). Ours was a cherry tomato with a spicy, creamy sauce. Although I was hoping for shrimp, the tomato was juicy and full of flavor, and paired nicely with the spicy sauce and crispy bacon. -Oysters: I still prefer my oysters raw, but if they're going to be grilled, this is the way to do it. The flavors and textures of cheese, butter, and charred lemon all complement the slight brine of the oysters. If we had one gripe, it would be that these accoutrements - while excellent - slightly did overwhelm the awesomeness of the oysters themselves. -Shrimp n grits: At $25 with the fried egg (!), this was priced well above most of the other brunch dishes, and we were questioning whether it was worth the extra cash. It was indeed. This was one of the better-tasting shrimp n grits dishes I've had, with its ""secret oils"" and Cajun spices grilled on to the juicy, slightly sticky shrimp. The grits were great: buttery, sure, but not overly heavy.What else? I appreciated Clancey's shimmery, hyper-modern aesthetic, and the retro-graffiti wall was cool, although I don't know if those things all mix well but whatever. I also appreciate that here, bacon continues to be offered up in creative ways, rather than being relegated to a mere side order. We may be long past the height of the bacon obsession trend, but, much like truffle, I think it's a craze that deserves to live on forever and ever.",0
13678,"Came to Banter after a workout class and was starving! I usually get avocado toast at brunch spots and I was happy that Banter's was a hearty serving. I got it without the cheese or egg to make it vegan but the  tomatoes plus spices they topped it with were delicious and made it feel well rounded. We also got coffee, a chai latte, and the beet toast with the cheese on the side. They have a tiny sitting area but we didn't have to wait for a spot on a Saturday at 10am. The service was great and the staff was friendly!",0
13677,"Came here for a team lunch with some coworkers, if nothing else you will leave here ready to slip directly into a food coma. Just about all of us ordered one of the lunch specials, which starts with a fried fish and several other small appetizers. I thought the fried fish was tasty, but it wasn't all that popular in my group. It's more lightly fried than it looks, but I think being able to see the fish's eyes is a little too much for some. The rest of the appetizers were hit or miss, but nothing too noteworthy. Having had the spicy soup here before and not being overwhelmed I felt like trying the danger level. It did pack quite a punch, unfortunately the broth didn't have much flavor along with it, just pure heat. The soup has a good mix of different seafood and meat options which all tasted solid. If you have any room left by the time your entree arrives, that was certainly the star of everyone's meal. The beef had delicious seasoning and as with everything else, the portion was super generous. It would have gone very well with the rice, but at this point I was picking my battles. Overall, it's not a bad place to go for lunch if you're in the area. You can certainly get better quality for $25, but it would be tough to find anything approaching this quantity that's still pretty good.",0
3554,Fantastic food!!!Walked by earlier around 3 and there was a line out the door. So we kinda knew it was a hot spot in the area. Came for early dinner and we ordered a steak (flank) taco salad and a chicken quesadilla. This food was so fresh and flavorful. Not the average Mexican joint. It's way up there in Manhattan but imho worth it.Service was great- prompt and informational. There's also outdoor seating which is comfortable. Their drinks look really good and they have a large variety of margaritas. Also a banging happy hour.,0
2682,"Title: A Taste of Shanghai at Its Finest

I recently dined at a restaurant that truly captures the essence of Shanghainese cuisine, and I must say, it was pretty great. The authenticity of the dishes shone through each bite. The Yan Du Xian soup, a regional specialty, was remarkable – a comforting blend of flavors that warmed the soul. Equally impressive were the pan-fried buns, crispy on the outside while still maintaining that fluffy texture inside.

A delightful surprise on the menu was the Xiang You Shan Hu, a dish that's not commonly found outside of Shanghai. It was prepared quite well, reflecting the kitchen's commitment to good quality food.

The ambiance of the restaurant added to the dining experience. The decor was tastefully done, enveloping diners in an atmosphere that’s both inviting and distinctly Shanghainese. Coupled with attentive service, the meal was an absolute pleasure.

A notable perk for those who prefer to handle transactions with cash, the restaurant offers a 4% discount on cash payments – a small but appreciated gesture.

In summary, for anyone looking to indulge in genuine Shanghainese cuisine, this restaurant is a must-visit. With its delectable food, charming setup, and good service, it promises a dining experience that's both satisfying and memorable.",1

The food orders came out within literally minutes which was very impressive. We were definitely very full by the end of our meal.

19900,"Heading into Little Italy, my expectations were high and this charming spot didn't disappoint. Be prepared for a generous serving of comfort as the portions are sizable, perfect for those looking to indulge in a carb fest. A pro-tip for fellow diners: don't miss out on the breadsticks, a true highlight and a must-request item – even though a meal here comes with bread, these sticks are simply irresistible.

The menu's star was the shrimp scampi, cooked to perfection, and the calamari appetizer deserves a special mention – easily climbing the ranks to become one of the best I've savored. If you find yourself wandering through Little Italy, make a beeline for this place; it's well worth the visit.",1

14657,"Title: A Bucket List-Worthy Lunch at a Bustling Ramen Spot

I finally ticked off a long-standing item on my foodie bucket list and headed to a popular ramen joint for a weekday lunch. The decision was spot-on; I was seated immediately, albeit at a communal table. The service proved to be as efficient as the bustling atmosphere suggested.

I dove into their signature shiromaru chashu ramen and was not disappointed – the flavors were authentic and the portion was generous, perfect for those with hearty appetites but a heads-up to anyone with a smaller stomach: this place does not offer takeaway containers for leftovers. So, order mindfully!

The restaurant doesn't skimp on the little things either – complimentary water and hand wipes are a thoughtful touch. The ambiance exudes a quintessentially Japanese vibe, which, coupled with reasonable prices, makes for an inviting dining experience.

Whether you're there to savor your meal or grab a quick bite, this spot caters to all. It's also an ideal locale for meet-ups. Just remember to eat what you can because what's left on your plate stays there. Overall, a must-visit for ramen enthusiasts!",1
1114,"Title: Quarantine Cravings Quashed by by CHLOE's Vegan Delights

In these days of quarantine, by CHLOE has become my go-to for satiating vegan cravings with their exceptional delivery service. Their commitment to serving hungry customers during such challenging times is commendable and deserves an extra thank you.

My taste buds have danced through two deliveries so far, both brimming with culinary diversity and top-notch taste that somehow straddle the line between health-conscious and indulgence. The sweet potato-cashew cheese sauce of their mac 'n' cheese is a creamy revelation, with the shiitake bacon and almonds adding texture that elevates the dish to new heights. The market veggie special – a concoction of sweet and spicy brussels sprouts with scallions – was a zesty delight, its sauce leaving a memorable kick.

Their kale artichoke dip, a creamy dream that pairs seamlessly with crispy chips, arrived warm, adding a comforting touch. And the tempeh chicky, an uncanny doppelganger for real meat, stands out both as a solo triumph and within the chicky chicky parm parm.

The only slight letdown was the crispy chicky salad; it was an interesting mix but yearned for more dressing than the solo container provided. A heads-up for extra dressing would be useful for future orders.

Kudos to the by CHLOE team for their tireless efforts. I'm already looking forward to my next vegan feast from this establishment.",1
17041,"Title: A Decent Experience with Americanized Korean Flavors

Rating: ★★★☆☆ (3.5/5)

My recent visit to this spot was a mixed bag – the food was satisfactory but didn't quite hit the mark of greatness. The standout for me was the crispy shrimp appetizer, which I thoroughly enjoyed and would happily recommend. The dumplings and spicy chicken buns were flavorful enough, but there was no memorable punch that would compel me to crave more. 

The hot stone crispy pork bowl, although featuring well-prepared pork, was let down by the lackluster taste of the accompanying ingredients, resulting in a dish that could have used a bit more zest. 

All in all, for those with an appetite for Americanized Korean cuisine, this place might just hit the spot. But if you're seeking an exceptional culinary experience, this may not be the first choice on your list.",1
1613,"Yeah this was a great place to get a quick meal. I would say that the food is pretty standard fare which makes it nice because it's predictable. Strangely enough, the standout item for me were their fries. I'm a sucker for battered, seasoned, and non-traditionally-shaped fries!!!The place seems to be full of tourists which isn't a bad thing but it can add a lot of foot traffic. Anyway, this place seems like a very reliable place to hop into for food and give you that old New York diner vibe. I give it three stars because it's ok. I wouldn't come back not because I didn't enjoy my meal but because it's just ordinary and there are tons of other places to try in New York City. If I lived in the neighborhood, I might consider coming back. However, it's not worth the effort if you don't live in the neighborhood.",0
10443,"Come here for drinks and the most beautiful view from Downtown Manhattan. I came on a Sunday with three of my closest friends, expecting an outstanding 3 course pre-fix lunch course ($79). The meal started with an outstanding assortment of creamy butter, anchovies and chicken liver mousse, which were complimentary. This was, unfortunately, the highlight of our meal. We officially started the Soft Scrambled Eggs with Pork Belly, Foie Gras and two orders of the Pork Sausage covered Snails. The snails, a dish I typically love, were exceptionally heavy, and the Foie Gras Reuben was too strange a combination. The Scrambled Eggs and Pork belly were simple outstanding, and a communal favorite. An hour after our dishes were cleared, our entrees arrived. We had two orders of the Wagyu Coulotte, which felt like a typical steak rather than the typically buttery soft wagyu. The lobster and fish dishes were better, but honestly, unforgettable. The desserts were equally ""okay."" We tried the apple, Marshmello, chocolate tart and date cake. Overall it was an ""okay"" experience, which is disappointing for such a revered NY restaurant. The service felt more like a recently opened restaurant. The waiter were very nice, but never there when you needed them. A mix up at the check-in, meant three of our party were immediately seated and the last fourth member told the three hadn't arrived and asked to wait at the bar for an additional 15 minutes. I appreciated they never rushed your eating experience but was frustrated that our lunch took about 4 hours for three courses. I was full before the entrees even arrived. None of these are deal breakers per day, however Manhatta is a relatively expensive experience. One expects exceptional service and food, whereas I found the views to be exceptional  and the rest to be an average experience. Pro-Tips;- Come for a drink on a Sunday during the day. The bar is empty and views are great.",0

2541,"A very exclusive vibe, but that also meant excellent service and good music/ambiance. The best of it, though, is the food. We saw that they had a whole Vegan menu, so took my sister and SO glad we did. 2 of my favorite things we got were vegan! Including dessert: the pistachio cheesecake is out. ragious. The (vegan) spaghetti squash pomodoro is maybe my favorite thing from dinner -- a fabulous slightly sweet sauce set off by roasted broccolini. The Branzino was also incredible though: rich and buttery with a Mediterranean vegetable medley to offset with a nice brightness. The fish was soft and flaky with a delicious fried crunch around the outside. For a splurge, the spicy fried shrimp was awesome too. Lots of good items but those 4 were my faves!",0
19878,"This restaurant lives up to its high praises. Despite the Saturday night crowd, the attentive staff managed to secure us a lovely window seat. The wine selection impressed us with its unique offerings, generously provided in taste portions. The chicharrones were a hit with my fiancé, and although the radishes were somewhat underwhelming, the celery root soup was a standout dish – the combination of smoked trout, roe, and hazelnuts was simply divine. I'm eager to return for a full dining experience and to further explore their wine list.",1
12288,"Been here twice since its grand opening. Glad to have dim sum near work! Everything I had was delicious and perfectly cooked. The service is good as well. Once for dine in, once for takeout.Dined in with a friend. Ordered strictly from the dim sum menu - pork bun, scallion pancake, peashoot shrimp dumpling, pork juicy dumpling (soup dumplings), and beef noodle roll. The scallion pancake was nice and crispy. Pork buns perfectly soft and sweet. The soup dumplings were good, one of mine was lacking a little broth but the others I had were filled properly. One could have leaked before I got to it. The beef noodle roll was good but a little hard to grab with chopsticks because it was so soft (easier with a spoon). The sauce was very flavorful. The shrimp peashoot dumplings were nice too. The meal comes with 3 dipping sauces - ginger, soy, chili. I liked using them alone or in combination. For takeout I got the crispy salt and pepper pork to compare to Hop Kee (our favorite place for this dish). I took that and the spicy spare ribs home to reheat in the air fryer to re-crisp them up. They were both yummy and the pork chop is a good alternative to trekking to Chinatown. They were a little hard to eat at times when avoiding the little bones.I also tried the shredded duck dumpling, duck spring roll, and szechuan mushroom dumpling - they survived the trip home and hit the spot. They did include the 3 sauces for takeout as well though not as much as dining in. Will be back!",0
19203,"Title: A Birthday Feast to Remember

From the moment I stepped into this elegant establishment, I was graced with an amazing dining experience. The manager personally greeted us with a handsome welcome, seating us promptly and presenting the menus without delay. Despite the hustle of restaurant week, with its tempting special menu, I opted to celebrate my birthday from their regular offerings, each dish proving to be a delightful culinary masterpiece.

The option for a wine pairing only enhanced the flavors of our meal, exhibiting the thoughtful curation of their menu. The service throughout the evening was nothing short of exquisite, with attentive staff ensuring every detail was perfect.

This charming restaurant has left an indelible impression, and I am brimming with anticipation for my next visit. A truly exceptional experience!",1
16060,"I really enjoyed the pizza here! My boyfriend and I got 4 slices. I have to say my personal favorite was The Grandma!The flavor was just amazing. Perhaps it was because I ate this slice first that I thought the rest of the slices I tried couldn't compare (which is the reason for my 4 stars instead of 5), but my boyfriend loved everything we got. We also had the Bianco, the pepperoni, and the Margherita. I thought the bianco was a bit eh, but my bf really liked it so it's a matter of opinion I guess? But The Grandma is a MUST HAVE!! We would definitely be coming back next time we are in town. I will be crazing these Grandma slices until I return!",0
10714,Late night dinner in midtown. Pleasantly surprised by the service and quality of the burger. I had the 50:50 burger which is 50 percent beef and 50 percent pork. Perfectly cooked medium. The bun was lightly buttered and toasted and dressed with aoli mayo. Nice touch. The steak fries were perfect. Service was fast and friendly at midnight.,0
2006,"Joe's Pizza is an iconic hole in the wall establishment that needs to be on  your must visit list when visiting the city. We visited the Carmine Street location at the perfect time (4 pm) on a Friday afternoon for a pre show snack. Food: Not a huge menu, a handful of topping combinations and several bottle/canned beverages but it was still one of our favorite meals on this latest visit to Manhattan. The pizza was amazing with a perfectly crisp thin crust with just the right amount of sauce and cheese. Not greasy or heavy, it's easy to put down a few slices in no time. We also tried the Sicilian square which was a thick, chewy version where the crust was more like french bread and very tasty.Service: Step up to the counter, order your slice(s), step to left to pay, wait for them to serve up your order in a few minutes. The staff behind the counter were very friendly and helpful, I guess I'd be happy too if I was surrounded by all that deliciousness! Atmosphere: Perfect NY Pizza place with a limited seating inside the small restaurant. Classic no frills place but great for people watching if you sit at the counter facing the street. Value: Coming in right around $3 per slice it's hard to get a better value versus quality pizza anywhere. I realize there are cheaper (.99) pizza slices but Joe's slice is worth every penny!Overall: Best pizza we've had in a long time, maybe ever! This will be on our repeat visit list for our future adventures to NYC!",0
15222,"Title: A Delightful Brunch Experience at Jane's

My latest visit to this bustling eatery was a testament to the necessity of reservations. Despite it being a weekday, we faced over an hour wait for a table, a clear sign of the place's popularity. Thankfully, the food lived up to the hype. Presentation was on point, and you're spoiled for choice between savory and sweet. My suggestion? The Jane breakfast for those who favor the savory, or indulge in the vanilla bean French toast to satisfy your sweet tooth.

While the absence of brunch alcohol specials means paying per drink, the elderflower grapefruit mimosa I had was a refreshing standout. The service was another highlight, with both the host and waiter being exceptionally helpful and attentive, guiding us through the menu with expert recommendations.

I'm already planning my next visit to Jane's, reservations definitely included, for another round of their delectable offerings.",1
15718,"I can't say for certain if that burger is one of the best I've ever eaten (probably because I haven't fully availed myself of all the many burgers in  this city) but it's definitely one of the most creative, starting with the pretzel bun, the caramelized onions, and that special sauce. Yes, it'll get all over your hands and face. The neatest way to get that thing in your belly is to cut it in half and proceed but there's something really primal about just hefting it in your hands. My one very tiny nit (and I almost will never say such a thing) is that the burger seemed to lack just a bit more seasoning.  A-Also, why aren't curly fries more of a thing with burgers? Emily's brought me back to how AMC Loews used to serve a cone of curly fries, which I would always demolish during the previews. I couldn't stop eating these, which retained a perfect crispiness even after sitting for awhile.  AThe other dishes we ordered were a little less mind-blowing. Both of the salads we ordered were extraordinarily overpriced for the portion. We had asked for the dressing to be served on the side with the broccoli salad ... and were served a bowl of the saddest, spottiest, wilted yellow florets. Like seriously, week-old, bottom of the crisper, totally-forgot-I-had-these broccoli chopped up. I really wish I had taken a picture. The cherry was that, on one of the peach slivers, there was a bit of the produce sticker that had not been removed before it was cut. The saving grace of this salad was the miso dressing.  CThe Detroit-style pie was also maybe too heavy on the bread.  I could eat a whole pizza without the crust and this was essentially 85% crust with sauce and cheese.  Just a personal preference.  I did love how puffy the dough was, with a sprinkling of baked cheese on the edges.  B+Asparagus salad. Really meh. Some asparagus slivers and some twirly bits of another green vegetable.  B Overall: Glad I finally tried the Emily burger but now want to try others in the city to compare.",0
1838,"Title: Quaint Spot for a Quick Vegan Bite in Chinatown

During a stroll through Chinatown, my companion and I decided to try the vegan burger at a snug little eatery we stumbled upon. The space is compact—a mere four steps from the entrance lands you at the cashier and smack dab in the middle of the dining area. With such confined quarters, the heat from the grill was undeniable, creating an unintentionally warm dining experience for us and the hard-working staff.

Seating is limited to fewer than ten bar stools, offering a view of the bustling street scene, which added a nice touch to our meal. Fortuitously, the restaurant wasn't crowded during our visit, allowing us some personal space.

The vegan burgers were impressive in size, promising a hearty meal. There was a minor mix-up with our orders, but it turned into an impromptu opportunity to sample each other's selections by swapping halves. The food was decent, providing a satisfying, if not memorable, meal fit for anyone needing a plant-based refuel in Chinatown.

While the bill came up to a somewhat steep $40, the convenience and location might justify the cost for some. Would I revisit? If I found myself in the neighborhood with a craving for a quick vegan option, a return isn't off the table.",1
10297,"Following a few hearty recommendations, I ventured into Tacombi with my boyfriend for a late-night taco treat. The menu pricing and portion sizes struck a satisfying balance – a couple of tacos each paired with an appetizer left us content. The tapas-style delivery of our tacos, arriving in intervals, allowed us to savor a variety of flavors. The mix-and-match taco option is a definite plus, as it invites a tantalizing culinary exploration.

Our Sunday night visit was met with a hushed ambiance, ensuring prompt service and attention to our refreshment needs. Tacombi stands out as a must-visit spot for those in search of a trusty taco with a delightful spin on traditional flavors.",1
1681,"I don't think I've ever had an Umami burger. On this visit, I ordered a salad. Before you ridicule me, this is why: Ritual was having their $1 week, so I was able to order their taco salad for $1. It was surprisingly good. This comes with lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, pickled onions, avocado, tortilla strips, seasoned taco meat (extra $2 for protein), and jalapeño dressing on the side. It sounds like it would be a heavy salad, but it actually wasn't. It was the perfect portion. Not sure I'd order it at its full price, but maybe I'll finally try the burger next time!",0
1466,"I recently had a delightful Japanese brunch experience at this eatery. The staff was considerate, allowing me to be seated as I awaited a companion, and I appreciated the thoughtful touch of serving iced tea over the usual water. The parade of dishes from the kitchen was visually impressive, tempting the taste buds. I chose the short rib hash, which was absolutely delicious, savory, and well-prepared. My only slight critique would be that the eggs were a tad underdone for my preference, but that's just a matter of personal taste. Highly recommend for a unique brunch offering!",1
20721,"Title: A Shawarma Spot Worth the Buzz

If you're on the hunt for an excellent chicken shawarma that's juicy and perfectly spiced, look no further. On my latest visit, the chicken shawarma was exceptional, though a tad more tahini would have been the cherry on top. Despite that minor wish, the service was impressively quick, a real plus considering the late hour and the bustling crowd, which was an entertaining mix of nightlife enthusiasts from nearby La Caverna and late-night foodies.

My companions raved about both the falafel and the lamb shawarma sandwich, adding to the consensus that this place is a hit. It's a mystery why some Yelpers have reported it as closed—it's very much open and I'm already eager for my next visit.",1
19354,"The Quick: How is this place vegan? A vegan french place... With Incredible vegan steak tartare, cheese plate, and more. Small charming spot, make reservations. The Details: I couldn't believe it until I tried it for myself, twice. The food is absolutely incredible and 100% organic and plant-based. Has that real French Bistro flare and feel, on a gorgeous block, with great Wine... And Food you can feel good about eating. The steak tartare with fries is a must order! As as the cheese plate. The escargot and french onion soup was good, but less interesting to me personally.I still don't understand how they made an incredible plant-based steak tartare, you have to try it to understand. I've been told there breakfast croissants are better than France by a  Parisian. I feel confident saying everything on the menu will impress you!

19620,"Title: Disappointing Brunch at a Popular Spot

I recently attended a brunch with a group of 14 ladies at a local restaurant, and unfortunately, we were left underwhelmed. Despite booking two months ahead, our 1pm reservation was delayed as they insisted on waiting for the full party, leading to us being seated at almost 2pm. Service was painfully slow, with drinks and appetizers taking an age to arrive.

The main dishes were served erratically in small groups of two or three, causing some meals to arrive cold and necessitating a return to the kitchen. The staff was clearly overwhelmed, with one waitress tending to our large group as well as another, leading to constant reminders for basic condiments.

On the positive side, the ambiance was vibrant, with a DJ providing excellent music that kept the mood upbeat. The quality of the food was satisfactory; the yucca fries stood out, and the appetizers, though small, were flavorful. However, the bashment punch could have been stronger.

It pains me to say, as I usually champion local and black-owned businesses, that the service was simply unacceptable. The disorganization significantly detracted from the overall dining experience, overshadowing the delicious food and lively atmosphere.",1
2966,"Title: Joe's Pizzeria: A Slice Above the Rest

If you're hunting for the quintessential New York slice, Joe's Pizzeria is where your quest triumphantly ends. With an allure so strong it could whisk your date right from under your nose, Joe's serves up pizza so divine it lives up to, and surpasses, its cinematic fame (Yes, I'm nodding at you, Spiderman fans).

Despite the buzz, you won't be left queuing for ages; the service is swift, the wait minimal, and the reward, sublime. Pro Tip: Go for whatever's just kissed the flames of the oven and landed on the counter. I plunged into the pepperoni pizza and was swept off my feet. But the real star? The tomato sauce — an ode to the summer-kissed sweetness of fresh tomatoes.

Don't shy away from customizing your slice with a dash of garlic powder, parmesan, or red pepper from the available shakers; it's the secret handshake into pizza nirvana. Out of all the Joe's outposts dotting the city, this one takes the crown for dishing out a superior slice. And who knows, you might catch Joe himself running the show.

Just remember, this slice of heaven is cash-only. So come prepared, lest you’re left salivating on the sidelines.",1
3291,"Dined at this eclectic gem where the Fun-guy dumplings were an absolute delight, packing a punch with every bite. The Spicy Mang Confit potato offered a harmonious blend of sweet and heat. Washed it all down with the refreshingly unique H2Omelon lemonade - a must-try! The Strawberry yuzu lemonade was equally impressive, a perfect tart-sweet balance. The meal concluded with the Chef's Cookie: a delightful treat that truly encapsulates the art of dessert. If 42 signifies life's ultimate answer, the menu here presents an unparalleled answer to satiating your culinary quests any day.",1
12547,"Title: A Hearty Feast with a Side of Caution

My experience at this eatery was largely delightful, marked by generous portions at fair prices and service that was both efficient and warm. The star of the menu was undoubtedly the porridge with pork, liver, and kidney, which earned a resounding 5-star rating for its tenderness and perfectly marinated morsels. The fish porridge, though delicious, left a bit to be desired in terms of fish quantity, nudging it to a solid 4.5 stars.

However, the thousand duck egg and pork porridge encountered a hiccup; while the pork was succulent, the larger pieces of preserved duck egg imparted a peculiar chemical taste, diminishing the dish to a modest 3-star rating.

The noodles were a revelation with both pork and shrimp and chives, and the beef variation, scoring a full 5 stars. They were packed with well-seasoned, flavorful protein. However, the rice noodles were heavy on the oil, making them a bit of a gastric challenge and raising some health concerns - particularly after the duck egg letdown. Consequently, this place might best be categorized as an infrequent indulgence rather than a dietary staple.

With minimal wait times, this spot earns a recommendation for those looking for a quick and tasty meal, albeit with a note of caution for the health-conscious diner.",1
12238,"Tucked away in a cityscape besieged by overpriced, uninspiring fare, Tribeca's Kitchen is a gem well worth the journey. Prioritizing health and quality, their lunchtime offerings impress – omelets crafted with organic eggs, hearty portions of fresh vegetables, and hash browns made from scratch with perfectly seasoned, real potatoes – a far cry from the all-too-common cheapest eggs and frozen hash browns of their competitors. Accompanied by exceptionally accommodating service in a charming slice of the city, our pre-World Trade Center ascent meal was a delightful experience. While their dinner and breakfast menus suggest a steeper cost that could raise value concerns, the lunch specials prove to be an unequivocal hit. For those in the vicinity, Tribeca's Kitchen warrants a visit.",1
17621,"I recently visited a Mexican restaurant on bustling Stone Street, and my experience was fairly average. The food was unremarkable in taste and authenticity, yet the prices didn't break the bank, which balanced things out somewhat. Service was competent, neither exceeding nor falling short of expectations. The real draw to this spot is the outdoor seating on Stone Street itself, where you can enjoy the vibrant atmosphere at picnic-style tables – making it a solid choice for group gatherings. As for the drinks, the margarita towers, while visually impressive, tasted just okay. They seem to serve more as a fun centerpiece for your table rather than a highlight of the menu. Overall, it's a decent spot if you're in it more for the social vibe than for a culinary adventure.",1
19837,Nice spot for a rest for a Cloister visit. The salmon was delicious and perfectly cooked medium rare.,0
20976,Came back on a snowy day for some delicious pizza. It was pretty empty for lunch so service was really fast. Tried the parmigiana (eggplant parmigiana) which was tasty. Loved the ricotta but tbh  the eggplant parm was a bit tasteless. Solid square pizza though,0
13983,"I quite like this place although it's got a really mixed reviews. I've came here twice so far (more than half a year apart) the taste is still the same so the consistency is great (drinks as well). The plum wine (Choya, Choya Excellent, Kinsen) are all good but Choya is the sweetest and Kinsen is the least sweet. I'd say I prefer Kinsen but Choya Excellent is really amazing too. Choya is one of my go to but sometimes it does get a bit too sweet for me unless you add a lot of ice cubes. My friend likes the cocktails but it's just too light for me but the alcohol they use is fine, doesn't give anyone a headache. If you like something really light and not strong at all, their cocktails are good. Good is a bit on the pricey side consider their portion is a bit smaller but it's still pretty worth it in my opinion. The skewers, appetizers, and main dishes are all very tasty. Especially the skewers and appetizers are my go to. This place is not a place I'd frequent every week or month but it's definitely a place for my to come back to from time to time. I do recommend people to check it out. The seats are super small and crowded but other then that I'd say I'm pretty satisfied with everything. The waiters are all friendly so far some are more attentive than others but usually it's fine. It's a place I don't mind traveling for and it's a nice place to hang with friends. They do offer some desserts as well. Walkable to subway station and easy to find.",0

I stumbled upon this gem while waiting for a table at Nom Wah and I'm so glad I did. As someone with Taiwanese roots, the menu had me nostalgic and eager to dig in. I wasn't disappointed. The sticky rice stuffed lotus root was a sublime start, followed by addicting salt and pepper fried chicken and a savory pork chop that packed a punch of flavor. The best surprise? The bill!

The Campanelle had mushrooms and cheese all cooked into the deliciously fresh pasta. The meat sauce in the tagliatelle was amazing. So flavorful. I would come back in a heart beat and would suggest to anyone!",0

Start with an assorted basket of chilled breads and wonderful cracker-like breadsticks with sesame seeds. I started my luncheon with a bowl of the ""soup of the day"" which was some sort of white beans with pasta ($7.95) - this was a large bowl of soup and quite tasty. For my entree,  I chose the Fettucine Bolognese from the lunch menu ($12.00); a  generous portion and delicious! I also had a sumptuous glass of red sangria, in a large wine glass that was also fabulous and included fresh fruit in the drink ($14.00) Highly recommended!",0
3262,"If you come before the dinner rush on a weekday, it's relatively empty. It has only 22 seats, with only 2 of them a 2 seater.Came to try the infamous big tray chicken. I spent the $2 and got the noodles too. This tray is definitely meant to be shared. It comes with potatoes and chicken in the dish. The chicken is sometimes still attached to the bone. Would have been nicer if it was all boneless. The spice could use some work too. Definitely some crunch on the peppercorns but there was extremely light mala flavor in this dish. The chili oil on the side was required for my tastebuds and gave me a sweaty head. I ended up using their soup spoon to drink broth with most of my bites to ensure I get all of the flavor of the broth with the meat, potatoes and noodles.Wait staff was nice to me. I read other reviews where they are pushy. I get it since it's a small joint but luckily I went when it was slow. The chef also smiled at me as she took a break to walk outside. Perhaps I looked terrible from my sweat storm. I downed the whole thing myself.If you're looking for what I gather is an authentic henan experience go here and get that A1 - big tray chicken. They also have a menu full of other goodies too. If you want pure mala, then one must look elsewhere like mala project or cafe China.",0
3385,"We accidentally found ourselves at the back bar of a bustling restaurant and were met with a slightly confusing setup – we had to register with a hostess at the main entrance before being allowed to order at the bar. While our party of three managed to squeeze in, one of us had to remain standing, but it wasn't too much of an inconvenience. Unfortunately, the establishment didn't offer happy hour specials and the old fashioned I tried was disappointingly weak.

However, a highlight of our visit was the Bonito flakes waffle fries – an absolute must-try. Do note that the portion is generous, so be prepared to share. Despite the initial confusion and the cocktail letdown, those waffle fries alone might be worth a second visit.",1

Of course, there is so much more than ping pong here - the food and drink here is also pretty good. My favorite food is the risotto balls while my bf likes the fried chicken nuggets. The vibe is chill and modern. The employees constantly walk around with a nest to collect ping pong balls. Will definitely come back for a fun and relaxing night",0
20627,"Grabbed some food at Filaga Pizzeria on Thursday evening. While I liked one of the slices I ordered, the prices are simply unreasonable for the size and the quality of the pizza.Quality: While doing some shopping at Chelsea Market, I decided to grab some pizza. Ended up with two different slices, a Diavola and a Pugliese. The Pugliese was the better of the two with zucchini, cherry tomatoes, tomato pesto, and an entire burrata on top. It was worth it just for the burrata, but the flavors worked well and the thin crispy crust was solid. The Diavola Slice however was not very good. With spicy salami, tomato sauce, and mozzarella, it was a greasy soggy mess. It did not have the same crisp as the Slice of Pugliese, and I did not like the zesty tomato sauce.Quantity: Small square slices, even two did not leave me full.Value: $6.50 for a Slice of Diavola. $7.50 for a Slice of Pugliese.Ambiance: Filaga Pizzeria is located inside Chelsea Market. It is in a communal area surrounded by other food stands, but it is still relatively large. They have a space for you to order, then a long bar displaying the different styles of pizza available. There were some seats along the counter for folks choosing to eat there, which I recommend as the pizza is messy. They had music playing, but it was competing with other nearby stands, creating a jumbled mess.Crowd: A few other guests sitting along the bar.Service: They are quick to heat up slices and get them out to customers.Parking: Extremely tough to find nearby parking.",0

The first course was pate and it was huge and filling but a bit too salty for me so i had to ask for refill of the bread to eat it with. The second course was lamb polenta but i was too full after the pate and the polenta was very filling too. I wish the minced lamb was less fatty. For the tiramisu, it was literally dripping water and the alcohol taste was almost zero and the cake was melting so was not that good. Last but not least, thanks to Yelp, there was check-in offer of a free glass of wine and that was a good bonus to the meal!However, I was really shocked by the fact that there was no AC on the second floor and it was like 90+ degree outside and it was hot and really hard to eat during this condition and the staff was trying to bring fans but it could not blow wind for the whole place.Overall, the price for the amount of food is still good but do not expect to have a good condition when you come.",0
17851,"I enjoyed a pleasant dinner at this Japanese restaurant on a quiet weeknight, immediately being seated upon arrival. The uncomplicated menu boasts authentic Japanese fare, particularly a selection of ramen, which was my main focus. I opted for the kuro ramen, enticed by the enticing aroma of black garlic that greeted me as the dish was served.

The first sips of broth were delightful, with the black garlic oil shining as the standout feature. However, the depth of flavors didn't progress much beyond that initial garlic punch, leading to a somewhat monotonous taste experience halfway through the meal.

That said, the noodles achieved an ideal chewy consistency, and the softly cooked egg was suitably savory. The chashu, with its seared surface, added a welcome textural contrast and a smokey layer to the dish. 

In sum, despite the broth's room for improvement, the restaurant offers a fundamentally good bowl of ramen that warrants a return visit.",1
12866,"During my recent visit to the restaurant, I encountered a taste profile that was disappointingly bland across multiple offerings. The ginger chicken, one of the main attractions, was notably flavor-deficient. The dish's accompanying toppings did little to elevate the experience, presenting as under-seasoned and unremarkable.

Sauces available for enhancement were a letdown, being both watery in consistency and tepid in temperature, which compromised their ability to meld with the noodles effectively. A reimagining of these sauces to a thicker, more robust state could potentially rectify this issue.

On a more positive note, my coworker's tofu bowl received a modest nod of approval, although its appearance struck me as somewhat arid. There is certainly room for improvement in both taste and presentation at this establishment.",1
10212,"o:n° is a relatively new Korean hot-pot restaurant that opened up in Nomad. I overall enjoyed most of the food that I tried here, but I couldn't help but be a bit disappointed. I think that I was expecting a lot more after reading the fantastic reviews here on Yelp.Here is what we tried:- Mushroom rice cakes: One of our favorite things here. The rice cakes had the perfect texture, everything was well balanced, and it was beautifully plated. Great way to start the meal- Baccala (salted cod): It was fine, but we were expecting a more powerful, saltier punch than what we got- XO noodles: We ate this when it was just introduced on the menu as a special. It packs a lot of flavor with an addictive sweet and surprisingly spicy sauce. I recommend mixing in the poached egg on top which adds a rich, creamy texture and cuts the spiciness- Spicy beef short ribs (galbi jjim): We enjoyed this quite a lot. The short ribs were really tender and the broth was faithful to what a traditional spicy galbi jjim should taste like. I'm not sure the soft scrambled eggs added much, although they were perfectly cooked- Tomato seafood: We were a bit disappointed in this one. The seafood was well cooked, but the broth didn't have a lot of Korean flavors. It reminded me of a slightly spicier version of a cioppino. The best part of the dish for us was actually the roti served on the side, which were perfectly crispy and flakyI do like that they cook the rice fresh tableside. Nice touch!Everything else: Very modern, minimalistic interior design. Service was friendly and attentive. Prices were OK although portions were a bit smaller than what I expected given the generally high prices, especially for the appetizers.Bottom line: I think that o:n° caters to non-Koreans who want to be introduced to Korean food outside of just Korean BBQ and fried chicken, and I imagine that it will be a huge hit with that specific crowd. However, Koreans and Korean Americans may be slightly disappointed.",0
17281,"Title: Classic Charm and Superb Service Shine at American Steakhouse

Review:

Stepped into an American nostalgia scene for a business lunch with a group of 14 at this traditional 1950's-themed steakhouse last Friday, and it didn't disappoint. Greeted by Sinatra tunes and a private room sectioned off with sliding doors, the secluded ambiance was perfect for our gathering. Despite being younger and predominantly female in a sea of white-suited, middle-aged businessmen, the atmosphere was welcoming.

The service was a highlight: our experienced waiter was the epitome of professionalism, offering advice with charm—even when our dirty martinis fell short of expectations, the bleu cheese stuffed olives provided a pleasant surprise.

While the lunch menu was truncated for our large party, it included a satisfactory selection. The beef broth soup brimmed with meat and vegetables, overshadowing the basic mixed greens and Caesar salads. The chicken parmigiana was generous enough for two, but the seared ahi tuna was disappointingly meager. 

However, the fillet mignon stole the show—expertly recommended at medium-rare by our waiter, it was a 10oz slice of heaven with a perfect sear and tenderly cooked interior. Sides like the Brussels sprouts with bacon demanded a second helping due to their smaller portions.

As for the desserts, they were hit or miss, with the raspberry sorbet and NY-style cheesecake being overly sweet, but the chocolate-rich brownie a la mode ended the meal on a high note.

In summary, while some dishes were unremarkable and the bread and butter forgettable, the standout fillet mignon and stellar service will bring me back to this steakhouse sanctuary.",1
13744,"Wish yelp would change there rating system. Cuz this would be 3.5 stars. Solid joint, I will be back. Had the clam chowder and rib meat ravioli. Both were fine. Not outstanding but fine. Everything was waaaaay under seasoned. I know I have a salty pallet but even the people I was with were begging for salt. Also they must have a competition on who saves the most ice. Or their mixers are not cold? By the time we got our cocktails it was basically served ""neat"" with three disengaged ice cubes on top.....yuck on you for what 7 or 8 dollar drinks? Our server Lauren was great!!!. To bad for them there are plenty of options.And btw at midnight on a friday the ""manager"" would lock the door everytime someone left. Not sure he was in right frame if mind. But it didn't feel comfortable and I'm fairly certain that's a fire hazard.Good luck.",0

If you're seeking a reliable 24/7 diner experience in the area, look no further. The milkshakes are creamy perfection, and the disco fries are the ultimate indulgent treat. The breakfast offerings consistently hit the mark, providing a satisfying start to the day. While service can vary from visit to visit, the friendly atmosphere usually makes up for any inconsistency. Be prepared to pay a bit of a premium for the convenience and quality, as the prices are on the steeper side. Yet, for those middle-of-the-night cravings or early morning fixes, this spot is without a doubt your best bet.",1
19034,"Restaurant Week Summer 2019...great deal for a Michelin star restaurant. We got the watermelon & burrata and chicken liver. The chicken liver was amazing - simple and done right with the perfect amount of toast and garnishes. We had to get the Pigs Out (for 2) since it was originally $59 on the regular menu, and it is also what Tuome is most known for. While this was some of the crispiest AND tender pork I have ever had in one bite, I am certainly glad I didn't pay full price for it. It was juicy and tasty, I wish the sauces had more taste and jazz. The peanut noodles that came with the pork were outstanding and could have been a standalone dish. My favorite thing we ordered was off the regular menu - the sticky rice with chinese sausage and duck fat. This typically very simple dish was exploding with flavor; so much so that I would literally come back here just for this. It is a MUST have experience. The desserts were meh and I would not order again. But the sticky rice is AMAZING!",0

We had a really great waitress until the end a new one came. We asked her to wrap up our food (we only ate half so we would have lunch tomorrow) and she accidentally threw it away instead. She offered us two fish tacos in replacement of part of lobster Mac and cheese ($21) and fish and chips ($18). Really sad to not be walking home with the leftovers we paid for......,0
15957,"Title: A Quaint Bite at Peach Mart, Hudson Yards

Review:
Nestled on the 5th floor of Hudson Yards, Peach Mart is a charming little spot that may raise eyebrows with its prices, but remember, location is key. Stepping into this pint-sized establishment, I was greeted by the cozy ambiance and a concise menu featuring sandwiches and a selection of Asian soft drinks.

On my visit, I opted for the smoked fish Kimbap priced at $12. A steep figure for Kimbap, yes, but the quality justified the expense. The smoked fish was delicately mashed, blended with mayo for creaminess, and accompanied by crispy, fresh veggies wrapped in seaweed, creating a satisfying harmony of flavors. While I did miss the sharp kick of wasabi, the overall taste was impressive.

An added touch of whimsy to the Peach Mart experience is their playful discount offer—if you spend over $10, you get to challenge the staff to a game of Rock Paper Scissors for $1 off your purchase. Not only did this add a fun twist to the dining experience, but the friendly service made it all the more enjoyable.

The seating area at the front is as inviting as the shop itself, making for a pleasant spot to savor your food. For anyone looking for a quick, tasty bite in Hudson Yards, Peach Mart is a cute find with a side of playfulness. Just brace yourself for the price point—it's all part of the charm in this upscale corner of the city.",1
2014,"I'm not vegan, but I found myself at By Chloe twice during a recent visit to NYC- eating healthy while traveling means more energy for exploring! I tried their black bean burger both times, with the matcha beauty latte- a nice mid-afternoon late lunch. Since I went at off-peak times, seating was available and I didn't feel rushed. By Chloe offers fast casual, plant-based meals that would appeal to non-vegans as well. None of the menu items are too pretentious- you can get your standard burger and fries, just without the real meat. The staff was friendly and efficient. This is a nice central area close to Trader Joe's, Bed Bath & Beyond, etc.- perfect spot to replenish & take a breather while out and about in the city. I'm sure I'll return!",0
12260,"Taco Dumbo presents a vibrant dining experience in the heart of NYC, beckoning with its neon pink mood lighting and modern, sleek decor. Boasting a full bar and ample seating, waits are notably absent in this fast-casual taco haven. Efficiency reigns as you place your order upfront, awaiting a swift delivery of culinary delight.

The taco offerings are a pleasant surprise in quality and creativity, standing out in the saturated fast-casual market. Even as a non-vegan, I found myself enamored with the Impossible taco, whose flavors tantalized my palate, and the vegan chorizo taco, remarkable for its unexpectedly creamy texture.

Not to be overshadowed, the frozen margaritas were an icy complement, while the guacamole was a fresh, flavorful staple. Taco Dumbo is a testament to the fast-casual genre, capable of delivering unique and satisfying eats that transcend dietary preferences.",1
18089,"Title: No Champion in This Pizza Arena

If ""Champion Pizza"" was vying for a top podium finish, it stumbled at the starting block. The lukewarm slice I received was far from a winner – in fact, it was one of my less memorable pizza experiences. With each bite, my hopes of a flavorful turnaround diminished, and the poorly assembled pie failed to impress.

In a city like New York, known for its exceptional pizza, I expected a slice that would at least compete. Yet, this greeted me with mediocrity, wrapped in the lackluster warmth of a slice that seemed to apologize with each chew.

The restaurant's kitschy decor, adorned with tourist snapshots, was a visual highlight, overshadowing the main event. While the space has its charms, including its non-chain status, the limited seating, ineffective air conditioning, and invasive cigarette smoke from the doorway spoiled the ambiance.

Pricing was another sore point. When prices climb, so do expectations – but this pizza couldn't leap over the bar it set for itself. Not even close.

Service, however, was a bright spot. The delightful staff member who served me is deserving of accolades the pizza could not earn, lifting my overall impression to a generous three stars.

In summary, while the establishment may have its heart in the right place and offers a reprieve from the larger chain options, the pizza itself barely scratches a three-star experience in a city that can otherwise rock your taste buds with its pizza prowess.",1
10172,"I have to start with describing their namesake dish, Mafaldini - Shrimp Scampi. It just stands out from every other shrimp scampi I've ever had. There's great crunch from the shrimp and generous amount of bread crumbs, a little citrus from the lemon juice and the pasta is satisfying (definitely Al dente).   The shrimp could be in slightly bigger pieces, but other than that I can't say enough good things about the dish. The Tuna crudo was excellent as well, but was on the small side even for an appetizer. But overall it had a nice flavor profile.The Octopus was delicious as well, I wouldn't change anything about the dish, aside from maybe needing to order 2 of them. Both times I ordered it, they were completely different sizes.Panna cotta was a nice way to finish off the meal, the watermelon was a refreshing touch. The decor is modern and beautiful, would recommend stopping by for dinner if you're in the area. I had a great experience both times I visited! I plan on trying the red snapper or the yellowtail crudo on my next visit.",0
15636,"I tried this place in Japan and loved it! I was scared that the New York location wouldn't live up to the memory but it did a good job. It felt the same walking in, but bigger and more commercial. They take your order on paper instead of a machine here which I think took away from my joy a bit. The best part about this place is that you can make the perfect ramen for yourself! As someone who hates vegetables I love that I can customize it so that I don't have any onions or bamboo. Otherwise you can change the firmness of your noodles, how garlicy you want it, if you want meat,  and how spicy you want it. The ramen was delicious. I got it firm and it was perfect. Broth was tasty and the perfect spice level. The only flaw was the chasu wasn't great. It didn't have the nice char that I normally like, but it was still good. Or at least everything else was so good I didn't mind. The only other minor issue was the bowl was a rectangle so it was hard to get the last bits of soup!Super expensive ramen... but very tasty!",0
1238,"Title: A Fresh and Flavorful Foray at Camellia - Service & Gelato Shine

As a newly invited guest to Camellia's group dinner, I embarked on a gastronomic journey with an array of menu items ready to delight. The staff’s unwavering hospitality set the tone, proving that exceptional service can make patrons yearn for a return visit.

Camellia’s spacious and modern ambience easily accommodates large parties, ensuring comfort alongside culinary exploration. The evening began with a standout dish – the fried pork belly. Defying expectations, it was wonderfully light, crunchy, and bereft of the usual oiliness, a true testament to the chef's skill. Paired with the salt and pepper fried chicken, a personal favorite emerged; the combination was an indulgent symphony.

While the steamed pork bao was average with a tad too much fat for my liking, the menu's flexibility was a plus – swapping out a missing hijiki salad for an inventive spinach and goji berry salad, which proved to be a delightful surprise in both taste and texture.

The ramen selection presented a mixed experience. While my Minced Pork Ramen, with its matcha noodles, felt imbalanced in favor of the noodles over meat, the spare rib and beef tenderloin variations sampled from friends' plates showcased a more robust and satisfying flavor profile. However, the common thread across all ramen dishes was a desire for a more generous meat-to-noodle ratio.

And then, dessert – a highlight at Camellia. The gelato selection was an unexpected joy, with the staff’s patience in letting us taste every flavor being a gesture of true customer appreciation. The White Rabbit flavor was a nostalgic revelation, while the lychee-rose was an exquisite dance of floral and fruity notes. This gelato experience alone warrants future visits.

Concluding the meal without the customary discomfort of bloating was the cherry on top, signalling that Camellia not only caters to taste buds but to overall well-being. This place is undoubtedly a strong contender for those conscious of digestion without compromising on a rich culinary experience.",1
3285,"Title: Unforgettable Ramen Experience

I've finally discovered my go-to ramen spot! The tonkotsu ramen here is unparalleled, offering layers of complexity in every spoonful. The broth stands out with its creamy richness, which is something I haven't encountered elsewhere. During my visit, the bonus of a free noodle refill only heightened the experience. While the mushrooms lacked a bit in flavor, they brought a welcome textural contrast to the mix. The standout, though, was the chashu - so fatty and tender it literally dissolved in my mouth. For those who fancy a kick, the spice can be adjusted; I'll be aiming for a 4-6 next time after playing it safe with a 3. Bottom line: This place serves up an incredible, must-try bowl of ramen.",1

2901,"For a Michelin restaurant, I'm a bit disappointed with my dining experience here. Location is great and was a cozy spot, but the food was very subpar in my opinion. I would give this place a 3.5.I'm obsessed with burrata so naturally I ordered the burrata with caramelized peaches, maple saffron and spicy hazelnuts. To be fair, this was a great start to my meal. Perfectly salty with sweet peaches and spicy all at the same time. We also got the fried baby squid with aioli sauce, Persian cucumbers and roasted fennel which was also a solid dish. Classic fried starter with great sauce and toppings. However, then things started turning slightly lackluster with the sweetbread and skirt steak. The sweetbread is actually fried, it almost tasted like chicken. But nothing too special other than that. The skirt steak was a bit bloody and extremely hard to chew. We also ordered the bacalao croqeutas which probably the star out of these tapas. I think I was just a little ""fried-out"" at that point since I had so many fried dishes here. I would definitely be mindful of that if you're wanting to try this place. The dish that I left last and I thought deserved it's own paragraph was the bone marrow. This was the star dish of the whole night. The bone marrow is huge and the marrow is salty, juicy and flavorful. Wish there were more marrow! We got the last one that night that the restaurant had so I felt pretty lucky. Definitely a must eat. Although this place did have a few standout dishes, overall, I didn't see how it earned its Michelin status all these years. It seemed like a typical restaurant I would go to - wasn't bad, but also wasn't Michelin status. I may be a bit too harsh since my expectations were set higher because of this, otherwise, for a typical restaurant it's quality Spanish style food. Don't think I'd be coming back since I'd rather try other Michelin restaurants that I would hope would live to their status.",0

After touching down with a rumbling stomach, my quest for the nearest dim sum led me to this gem, just a stone's throw from Port Authority and the bustling heart of Times Square. Despite its prime location amidst the city buzz, I was pleasantly surprised to snag a table without much wait.

Calling it the best dim sum I've ever had would be an understatement. Each morsel seemed to dissolve on the tongue, arriving piping hot and bursting with flavor. The variety was impressive, satisfying both adventurous palates and lovers of classic staples.

The service didn't miss a beat either—attentive without being overbearing. Whether you're a local or just passing through, if you crave authentic dim sum that's both mouthwatering and conveniently located, this spot is a must-visit.",1
2981,"Title: Popularity Over Taste at This Hyped Eatery

After much anticipation, I finally dined at a once-coveted spot, only to leave with mixed feelings, meriting a modest 3.5-star rating. The turnout before dinner time was overwhelming, with a crowd lining up by 5:40 pm. Dishearteningly, no walk-in tables were available, leading us to settle for bar seating after an hour-long wait, while tables required a patience-testing 2.5-hour queue.

The Bucatini, prominently featured on their menu, was a letdown. It lacked the culinary punch one would expect after such a wait, delivering a mediocre blend of spice and tomato in its sauce. The Texas Mimossa, while potently mixed, couldn't make up for the main's shortfall.

A sweet note to end on, the dessert did shine, ensuring the evening wasn't wholly disappointing. Nevertheless, despite its popularity, this restaurant doesn't quite live up to the hype where it truly counts — in the heart of the kitchen.",1

Of course because we were in the big apple, everything was waaaay bigger than I remember. Our server was quick to the table, took our drink orders, and gave us plenty of time to look over the menu. And after looking over the menu it was an easy choice. A bacon cheese burger with fries for my friend. Who had enough fries left over for my black hole of a stomach. And dessert for me, I had already ate before coming to Ruby Tuesday's. Which matters not, there's always room for desert. I was very pleased to have a chocolate fall out cake. The pieces of brownie were huge, ice cream was nice and creamy, them whipped cream and chocolate drizzle to top it off. Don't let the pictures deceive you, that was a huge dessert!",0
20002,"This is a nice place I went to several months ago so I don't remember all details. The interior is quite nice and it fits in well in the local area. I'd also put Mediterranean down or Farm To Table if that was a category because this is definitely a place that is proud of the ingredients they get. There was a good mix of ages here from older folks to younger parents with kids by the time I left. The food was excellent though I found the prices are bit high. A lot of people were ordering pasta but they had started ordering after I arrived.I had the Under the Sun cocktail but I don't remember much outside of a bourbon flavor and perhaps some type of sour fruit. It was good and well prepared. They gave some focaccia with some good olive oil to begin with which was good. As the menu was expensive, I ordered only their special of the day which was lamb chops with with roasted wild mushrooms and some roasted vegetables (potato and broccoli perhaps.) The excellent server noted that they tend to cook their lamb on the rare side and as expected the lamb was quite rare. I found it to be quite good though one of the three chops was a tad chewy and had a bit too much fat on it. Outside of the three small chops, there was a piece more like a lamb loin or lamb bacon which was tender and quite good (a large piece of this would have sufficed instead.) I would have preferred more meat for the price or at least for all the pieces to be cooked evenly (especially for a dish in the upper 30's) but overall the lamb was fine. The rest of the dish was well made with a much wider variety of mushrooms (I only recognized maybe 2/3 of them out of the 5/6) then I generally see in a place such as this and the au jus was fine.For the price, I found it good but not great. I liked the meal but it's hard to justify with the prices that I would be back soon. I would love to give this place a 3.5 but I can't bump this place up to a 4. The cocktail was excellent as noted as well as the service though. 3.4",0

11208,"Title: Authentic Taste of the Big Apple

YUMMM sums it up! Simplicity reigns supreme at this bustling hotspot, a magnet for tourists and late-night revelers alike. Despite the often-lengthy queue, service is a well-oiled machine—quick and efficient, unless they're momentarily out of pizzas. That might mean a pause in the line, but rest assured, it's a brief one as they whip up more of their sought-after pies.

Patience pays off, especially when you bite into their pepperoni slice. It's everything a classic New York slice should be: robust crust that can hold its own, pepperoni that's just the right amount of greasy goodness, and a generous layer of melty cheese. Truly, this is the quintessential NY pizza experience in all its glory.

But remember, they're keeping it old school, so leave your plastic at home—this place is cash only. Worth every penny and every minute of wait!",1
2763,"This is a legit restaurant right in the heart of Korea Town. They have delicious appetizers, entrees and BBQ. The service is really good and the food comes out surprisingly quickly. Our group of 4 ended up doing family style and ordered 5  items, which made each of us very full. The banchan was decent but a little limited. Overall my recommendations are: 1) Chadol Buchu: delicious beef brisket with just the right amount of flavor2) Grilled Mackerel: I wasn't expecting to enjoy the taste of this dish as much as I did, and it comes with 4 medium sized pieces of mackerel3) Braised Pork Belly with Aged Kimchi: mmmhhmm packed with flavor, a classic item to get4) Korean Fried Chicken: both flavors were good so I would go with the half and halfThey have 3 floors and a decent amount of table space.

19441,"Title: A Star for the Atmosphere at a Classy Yet Laid-back Eatery

From the moment you step inside, this restaurant charms with a vibe that's both upscale and welcoming - a rarity that rightly deserves applause. An ambiance that's not just classy but warm and inviting made my dining experience memorable enough to warrant an extra star in its rating.

Restaurant week was the perfect opportunity to explore their eclectic offerings. Standouts included the wonton taco with poke, boasting a delightful crunch from aerated pockets, and the empanadas, which struck a fine balance of cheesy without overwhelming the palate. Both appetizers were conveniently bite-sized and set a promising stage for what was to come.

However, the main courses, featuring bourbon short rib and salmon, acted more as placeholders rather than showstoppers. They were satisfactory, yet lacked the flair to demand a strong recommendation.

Dessert was a mixed bag. The reverse milk and cookies concept didn't quite hit the mark, with the cookie’s density detracting from its enjoyment rather than enhancing it. On a sweeter note, the doughnuts sprinkled with a touch too much sugar still managed to end the meal on a high, especially when dipped in the selection of seemingly homemade sauces - caramel, dark chocolate, and raspberry - each adding its own decadent twist.

In essence, this establishment makes up in charm what it occasionally lacks in culinary execution, and is certainly worth a visit for those seeking a lovely atmosphere accompanied by good, if not groundbreaking, food.",1
11135,"Title: A Mixed Experience at the Rustic Brunch Spot

My recent visit to this quaint restaurant, known for its rustic decor and bottomless brunch, was a bit of a mixed bag. First, a tip: parking in the area is a bit tricky, but Sundays seem to offer better odds.

The concept of unlimited drinks and small plates for brunch sounds fantastic. However, beware that the 2-hour limit on those bottomless beverages starts ticking from your reservation time, not from when you actually start drinking. We lost about 11 minutes just getting settled and waiting for service, so it wasn't quite the full experience.

The place has a charming rustic vibe, but space is tight, giving a cramped feel despite the lovely tables and decor. The dining style here is noteworthy, with a continuous flow of small plates that you can request again and again. The corn on the cob with cheese was a standout, utterly irresistible. The chicken tamal was decent, though not extraordinary, while the vegetable empanada was delightfully crispy and demanded a second helping. Sweet plantains topped with cilantro and sour cream were a hit, and the chicken enchilada had a fantastic tomatillo sauce, though I would have preferred cheese. The chilaquiles stole the show with their perfect spice level, and the smokiness of the pork taquitos impressed me profoundly – just a dollop of sour cream short of perfection. The huevos rancheros, unfortunately, were a letdown, arriving somewhat cold and underseasoned. Dessert, however, ended the meal on a high note with charming mini French toasts with Nutella and banana accompanied by tasty pastries.

Kudos to the staff for handling such a service-intensive brunch system, a commendable effort that also supports employment. Yet, the frenetic pace seems to have impacted food quality, with some items arriving cold, and the service was understandably not flawless.

In conclusion, while I admire the service model and the staff's dedication, the overall experience was hampered by the food's inconsistency. As such, I'm unlikely to return, primarily due to the unimpressive dishes that failed to live up to the potential of their flavorful descriptions.",1
2389,"Title: A Slice Above the Rest at Rubirosa

Having indulged in many a pizza within the boundaries of Boston, I can confidently declare that I've encountered the best pie yet, and it's not in my hometown—it's at Rubirosa. This place has a reputation for its knockout Supreme and Vodka pizzas, yet I ventured to try a half Vodka, half Fresca pizza for a lighter touch. My advice? Stick with the Vodka. The sauce on this one is deceptively light but packed with flavor, overshadowing the Fresca.

The pizza itself boasts a super thin, delightfully crunchy crust, though a touch more moisture wouldn't go amiss. At $21 for a 12"" small or roughly $27 for a large, these pizzas don't come cheap. Still, the price tag is justified by the quality of the pizza you're getting. Plus, a 25-minute wait for takeout is nothing to scoff at—reasonable and well worth it for a pie that sets a new standard for pizza connoisseurs like myself. Rubirosa, you’ve got a new fan.",1

16345,"Title: A Slice of Heaven Worth the Wait

After much anticipation fueled by a glowing New York Times review and a feature in the hit show 'Billions,' my expectations for this eatery were sky-high. The challenge of snagging a Saturday evening reservation did require a two-week advance commitment, but perseverance paid off with a prime seat next to the kitchen – a culinary theatre showcasing the craft of pizza perfection.

Our indulgence included the Bianca and Apollonia pizzas. Both were stellar examples of simplicity paired with premium ingredients. Each bite of the pizzas highlighted the understated elegance of their toppings, notably the buffalo mozzarella, which, despite being sparingly adorned, captured a flavor that was rich and unforgettable. The crust struck a perfect balance – a gratifying crunch that gave way to a soft, airy interior.

Admittedly, the service did lack some consistency and left us slightly confused as to who was steering the dining experience. Nonetheless, this did not detract from a delightful evening.

The experience concluded with the stracciatella gelato, an absolute revelation, enhanced by the subtle yet bold touch of sea salt flakes. This dessert didn't just satisfy—it was a sensation that elevated the entire meal.

In closing, despite the premium pricing and modest toppings, the restaurant champions quality with an unspoken confidence that resonates in every dish. It's a place where less is undoubtedly more, and where the food speaks for itself.",1
12845,"Title: A Tale of Two Experiences: Stellar Wine, Subpar Dining

My dining experience at this establishment left me with mixed feelings. As a wine bar, it earns a top rating of 5/5 for its excellent selection and service. The staff's enthusiasm for wine is contagious, and their willingness to offer tastings and recommendations made for a delightful experience. My friend and I were thrilled with each of the four glasses we enjoyed, all suggested by the knowledgeable servers.

However, the restaurant aspect does not live up to the high bar set by the wine service, warranting a modest 2.75/5. Despite the flexibility in allowing shared courses, which is appreciated, the food fell short of expectations. Long wait times of 30 minutes even for a simple order and lack of attentiveness dampened the experience. The dishes, from the overly salty Parisian gnocchi to the unremarkable duck paired with an incongruous fruit, left much to be desired. The barbecued carrots emerged as the highlight of the meal, while the peach panna cotta concluded the dinner on a tart, unimpressive note.

The need for more staff seems evident, both in the kitchen to expedite food preparation and in the dining area to maintain a steady presence for diners in need of attention.

In conclusion, I would recommend this spot to wine enthusiasts eager to explore an impressive array of options with excellent guidance. However, I'd hesitate to return for a meal, given the numerous superior dining choices in the vicinity. It is possible that we caught the kitchen on an off night, but with consistent quality being key, I’d prefer not to take that chance again.",1

1954,"During a recent visit to a local restaurant with friends around 9 pm, we encountered a perplexing seating policy that prohibited us from moving indoors if we chose an outdoor table. Despite this oddity, we settled in and ordered appetizers: mofonguitos, calamari, and chicharon de pollo. Regrettably, our food took nearly an hour to arrive, and when it did, it was merely warm, suggesting it had been neglected for a while before serving.

To pass the time, we enjoyed a pitcher of mojito, yet it lacked the quality of individual drinks from the bar—a discrepancy in satisfaction considering the pitcher cost $55 against $12 for a single mojito.

As the night rolled on and the establishment filled up around 11 pm, we dabbled in the hookah offerings, noting that it's cash-only with prices well-learned from frequent visits: $30 for a hookah and $15 for refills. However, the hookah attendant seemed to take advantage of my friend, failing to return change on two separate payments.

Later, a mix-up at the bar resulted in my card being charged thrice. Attempts to resolve the issue the next morning were unsuccessful.

While this experience has not entirely deterred me from returning, it serves as a cautionary tale to keep a vigilant eye on transactions within this restaurant in the future.",1
10305,"Title: Mixed Bag at Happy Hour

Upon visiting for happy hour, we discovered a letdown; the special menu was exclusive to the bar area, which lacked in ambiance. As a result, we missed out on anticipated oysters and settled in the dining space.

The Truffle Parmesan Fries fell short, arriving too lean and parched for my taste, not quite justifying the $12 price tag. Conversely, the Thai Mussels were a revelation at $29.50 - a burst of tantalizing flavors with a sauce so divine we relished every drop.

The dessert round presented a medley of 6 Donuts. Indulgences like the sultry, smooth chocolate and a playful s'mores variety shone brightly, while the cherry apricot provided a delicate fruity counterpoint. The pb&j rendition was nostalgic perfection. However, wild berry proved excessively tart, and the Reese's struggled to captivate us.

I'd return for the mussels alone and endorse the chocolate and s'mores donuts as must-haves.",1
12370,"Title: Fell Short of Authentic Taiwanese Flavors

My recent visit to this eatery left much to be desired in the quest for genuine Taiwanese cuisine. The beef noodle soup I looked forward to trying was a letdown; it seemed like a haphazard mix of sauces one might throw together during a kitchen experiment rather than a traditional recipe – although I will concede that the meat was commendably tender. The sausage savory crepe, unfortunately, was a misnomer. Instead of the expected sausage, we were met with what tasted akin to hot dog spam, which felt a tad deceptive. Lastly, the gwa bao was passable but failed to make a lasting impression. Overall, the restaurant didn't quite deliver the Taiwanese flavor it promised.",1
17492,"It has descent food. I was surprised the enchilada sauce was poured on top like a taco hehe instead of dipping the tortilla into the sauce and then make it a roll; the sauce was very good and I wished there were more than two enchiladas in one order. I loved  virgin pina colada because I could feel pineapple in my paladar. I forgot the name of a mint based cocktail I had, I didn't love it because there was too much alcohol in it to the point of burning like sensation in my throat. Finally I would give customer service a five star. Every staff member I interacted with were friendly, fun and helpful. The ambient here is relaxing and you can expect to have a good night with friends. Outdoor seating is available and you can enjoy NYC vibe.",0
20922,"This is a really fun club I came here on my birthday. It was easy to get in because we had a promoter who knows my friend really well. We had a table with bottles of vodka and I also got some champagne for my birthday. The girls are dressed as playboy bunnies and it was a really good vibe. The music was great ( this was on a Friday ). I feel like the people inside were so drunk that they ended up leaving around 2:30-3 am that night ! However , I had a great time and I love the decor ! I would definitely come back here for some drinks.P.S it was really hot inside and there was no service ( I have Verizon ) it's okay because i was enjoying the time with my friends !!!",0
14384,"Any time you have to make a reservation at a pizza place....it might be really good!  We chose Joe and Pats because of a pizza review done a few years ago by Barstool's Dave Portnoy.  With the people on the street trying to get featured on the film, it is one of the funniest Pizza Reviews ever.  Dave ended up raising his score, after the first piece, so we had to try it.  Let me be short and sweet.....this is the BEST pizza I have ever eaten, ever!  That was also the feeling around the table.  This is a must do every time we visit NYC.",0
17809,"So impressed with this place. The food, atmosphere, service -- everything was perfect. My friend and I were here (for a comped meal) on a Friday evening and had the opportunity to try an array of appetizers, entrees, and desserts.Together, the two of us shared the falafel latkes, the Israeli salad, the chicken schnitzel, a daily meat special (beef of some kind?), and the chocolate mousse. The Israeli salad was my absolute favorite -- it was so good and so fresh, especially with the toasty pita bread. Loved the chicken schnitzel, mashed potatoes on the side were incredible, and the chocolate mousse I could eat by the bucketful. We left so stuffed -- I don't remember the last time I had a meal so good. Also ordered a few of the signature drinks and teas and loved it all!Great service as well, 100% worth checking out.",0
13762,"I loved our visit to this hopping restaurant last night! We sat at the bar and watched the bartenders work their magic. Damn those drinks were strong and so good. I had the chicken quesadillas and they were delicious. The salsa and pico they serve is spicy and yummy. The portion size was perfect. I left full, happy and a bit tipsy.Update. Second visit and dropping some stars. The margaritas are fabulous and the bartenders are friendly but my food this time, not so fab. I ordered the carne asada tacos. Well the first one I tried was nothing but grizzle and fat. I literally spit it out on the side of the plate. Then I decided to see if the other others were better. Nope! Gross! I exchanged it for chicken tacos.. well they were those bland tacos ever. Literally just chunks of unseasoned meat.. I may come back but only for drinks next time.",0
20850,I am sad to say that unfortunately I was not impressed at all with Butter Midtown. My boyfriend is a fan of Alex Guarnaschelli so we came here for Valentines Day. We were both hoping to love this spot but we just didn't. I will start by saying the actual restaurant is beautiful. Big tall ceilings with a very upscale vibe. It was full that night as I mentioned it was VDay but the service was very much on point. We started with drinks and the Thick cut Veal Bacon. I did not like the Veal bacon at all and I am a fan of veal. It was covered in a red wine mustard sauce that was not appealing to the palate by any means. I was very disappointed that it was doused all over the bacon so I couldn't really get around the taste. For our entree we ordered the T-bone for two and the gnocchi mac-n-cheese. I was not thrilled by the steak at all. I found it to be semi-dry with very little flavor. The gnocchi mac-n-cheese was pretty good but it wasn't enough to make up for the lack taste with everything else that we ordered. As I mentioned I am seriously disappointed to have such an experience at a Top Chef's restaurant. Sadly I would not come back here and I would not recommend.,0
16459,"After visiting twice, my verdict on this eatery is that it ranks as merely mediocre, particularly given the cost and lackluster flavors. On my second visit, I chose a grilled chicken, tomato, red onion, and arugula dosa, served with cilantro chutney, which set me back over $15. Disappointingly, the dosa skin had a bitter burnt taste despite not being charred, and the filling was arid, with the chicken particularly parched. Considering the experience, a return visit doesn't seem warranted in the near future.",1
19856,"I recently visited a ramen spot that offers great value for the price. It's the ideal location for a casual get-together with friends or a solo meal when you're craving something comforting. I opted for the tonkatsu ramen paired with gyoza. While the ramen was quite satisfying, the gyoza was a tad oily but still enjoyable. Impressive was the speed of service; my order arrived in just 7 minutes and 32 seconds, even during the busy lunch rush. Although it may not be the stuff of last-meal fantasies, the experience was positive, and I'd consider it for a future quick and tasty meal.",1
11446,"This was my first time trying any of the food stalls in the Turnstyle Underground Market in Columbus Circle.  And I'm glad I decided to try Lisa's Dumplings since this is exactly the type of food that should be sold in this kind of venue.  Dumplings are easy to make (does not require a big kitchen) and great for eating on the go.  Next to the counter you can see them make the dumplings from scratch, which is kind of cool.I ordered the 7-piece pan-fried pork and shrimp dumplings.  You can get the dumplings cooked pan-fried or steamed.  The dumplings are small, much smaller than what I'm used, almost akin to appetizer size.  I liked the dough they used.  Thin and chewy.  The filing was tasty, but I did not get much of the shrimp flavor/pieces.   If you want a little bit of heat in your dipping sauce, you can ask for the chili sauce instead of the soy sauce dip. I must note that while there were no lines, I did have to wait a bit to get my order of dumplings.  Possibly because they make the dumplings to order??  It certainly tasted fresh.  So, if you are looking for a tasty treat on the go, try out this place. Seating is extremely limited and is shared by all the stalls.  They are open everyday from 11am-9pm.",0
18407,"Despite long waiting time, the services and food at BCD Tofu house were exceptional. Upon being seated, we were provided with multiple little complementry appetizers, which include veggies, Kimchi, fish, and more; all of which were refillable. The main coursed we ended up getting were different versions of stews. We can taste the freshness of the ingredients and the broth was very smoothing. Also want to thank our waiter who was very friendly in answering all questions that we had, refilled our free appetizers without us even needing to us, and was very patient with our photo requests.",0
14521,"My dining experience at this modern Italian eatery was nothing short of delightful. The extensive menu offered a variety of options, and I settled on a rich and savory ragu pasta, a tender chicken breast entrée, and a steak with potatoes cooked to a flawless medium. Each dish was vibrant with flavor, making every bite an absolute pleasure.

The cocktail selection complemented the meal beautifully, with expertly mixed drinks that were both refreshing and inventive. The standout of the evening, however, was the service. The staff's attentiveness added to the experience, and our waiter's enthusiasm and knowledge of the cuisine shone through. His dessert recommendation, a sublime chocolate bar paired with salted caramel ice cream and crumbs, was a triumph.

Despite the culinary highs, the atmosphere was somewhat marred by the incongruous soundtrack of hip hop and rap music. While I enjoy these genres on the dance floor, their presence felt misplaced in the restaurant's chic and upscale setting. A softer, more ambient music selection, such as jazz, would be a more fitting choice to elevate the already sophisticated ambiance.

Overall, the restaurant impressed with its exceptional food and impeccable service, although a reconsideration of the musical backdrop would make for an even more harmonious experience.",1
16805,"My go-to dim sum place in Chinatown. Prices are slightly higher than some neighboring places, but the ambience and quality are worth this difference! I love taking out of town friends here for a morning meal. I've ordered pretty much everything off the dim sum menu -- most notable are the custard pig buns, the durian puffs, har gow, cheung fan, mango pudding, and the pork spare ribs. You basically just take whatever you like off the rolling carts and pay off a checked menu at the end. It's a fun opportunity to eat family style and good place to try something new.Also, there's a 10% off coupon on the website for weekday dim sum -- show them before they bring you the bill!",0
17296,We came here during Valentine's Day for dinner. Read so many great reviews about Ootoya and we were glad we gave this place a shot. The restaurant is good spot to have a nice dinner date. The service is good. The environment of the restaurant is very chill and intimate. I had the recommend beef sukiyaki set. My first tastes of this dish was amazing. The flavor of this dish is nothing I had ever taste before. Goes really good with a side of the rice. Seems a like good authentic dish. Good spot to hit up especially if you want a good authentic Japanese food.,0
13045,I went here to celebrate my college graduation with my family and we all had a lovely time. Impeccable service and great decor.

3546,"I visited the restaurant in search of authentic Italian cuisine, but unfortunately, I left disappointed.

10933,"This is a review for Winter restaurant week. Sunday lunch.Place is really nice, quiet with a classic decor.We had a reservation for 6 and our stroller and we were seated in a really comfortable table like a booth. Very accommodating.The restaurant only had a couple of tables more so very quiet. Service good.Lunch deal consists in a main and a dessert. They had special wines at $10 per glass, so it was a good deal; however since we were 6 we had 2 bottles of wine.Restaurant offers complimentary bread which is SO GOOD!!! We were hungry so it was really nice.All of us had the filet mignon and we also ordered calamari, wedge salad as appetizers and extra creamy spinach as side. Those 3 dishes were really yummy!!!About the filet mignon: overcooked for all of us (but surprinsigly not dry! So at least wasn't that bad!). 3 of us ordered rare, and it came medium; and 3 ordered medium and it was done for us. THIS IS THE REASON WHY I GIVE 3 stars instead of 4; because I think that a steakhouse should not have this error. People go for the steak, so that should be perfectly cooked. No matter how good the rest can be, this is what the focus will be. I wonder if that was that specific day, what a pitySides were ok, whole carrot (with hint of cinnamon) and mashed potatoes. Presentation couldn't be funnier-a really sexual thing, LOLDesserts were ok. The chocolate was the best, ny cheesecake was ok and key lime too sweet and artificial.We also ordered mint tea and espressos which were VERY EXPENSIVE-$8 each, be careful!",0
10627,"came here on a Saturday night for dinner just because it was the nearest available restaurant in the area and the waiting hours wasn't as painfully long. It was around 30-40mins, but in other places it was at least 2 hours so this is the best one we got. i assume this actually is an international Japanese food franchise because I've seen it in several other countries with same logo, vibe, and type of cuisine - only slight differences in the menu. The staffs are very polite and helpful, so definitely service was pleasant. I ordered miso pork set that came with rice, pickles, and miso soup. The food looks pretty appealing and came in decent portion. Taste-wise it's not bad either. However I have to be honest it's just okay. Like there's nothing wrong with it but nothing special either. Decent food but not memorable or remarkable.  Thus, I'm not sure if I can agree with the price either because I expect something more. I'm not utterly disappointed but overall all I can say is so-so",0
15606,"Title: A Delightful Surprise at a Laid-Back Gem

I recently dined at a local spot that captured my affection with its relaxed vibe and unexpectedly stellar flavors. The Branzino, at first glance, didn't seem extraordinary, but each bite proved to be a revelation of superb taste that left me thoroughly impressed. Accompanying our meal was the cauliflower, a suggestion we gladly welcomed over the carrots, and it did not disappoint. My husband's verdict on his burger was one of satisfaction, praising its perfect cook. The potatoes, while adequate, weren't showstoppers. Nonetheless, the overall meal was a success with its tastiness standing out. We are eager for another visit. Food-wise, I'd point you towards the Branzino and the cauliflower for a truly enjoyable experience.",1

The large plate of chicken with noodles was nothing short of spectacular, boasting generous portions that could comfortably satisfy two diners. The eggplant appetizer was a delectable treat, setting the stage for a meal replete with robust, spicy flavors. This dining experience has left me eager to return and explore more of the menu – a testament to the establishment's culinary prowess. Highly recommended for those who appreciate hearty meals and a kick of spice.",1
20805,"Title: Soulful Vibes and Flavorful Bites

I recently visited a lively spot that encapsulates the essence of a thriving Black cultural scene. From the moment I entered, the throwback tunes of the 90s set an infectious, spirited atmosphere that had everyone grooving—even at 5 p.m. Despite the sweltering heat of New York City, which unfortunately made its way inside due to a faulty cooling system, the ambiance remained electric.

The culinary experience was a redeeming feature. Both the drinks and the dishes were nothing short of amazing, offering a delectable refuge from the heat. Sitting at the bar allowed me to fully absorb the vibrant energy that filled the room.

Service on this particular visit was laid-back; the bartenders were less attentive than some might prefer. However, this suited the casual, relaxed evening I was seeking. It's noteworthy, though, that on a different occasion, such inattentiveness could be a detractor.

For those looking for a place that celebrates great music, tantalizing food, and an unapologetically Black atmosphere, I wholeheartedly recommend this venue. It's a cultural gem that promises a memorable experience.",1
10762,"Title: Cozy Ambiance, Solid Service, but Expect More Bang for Your Buck

During my holiday visit to the city, I dined at a quaint Italian restaurant near my hotel, seeking a satisfying lunch experience. The restaurant's interior exuded a warm and cozy atmosphere, setting the stage for a meal that promised comfort and indulgence.

The service shone with efficiency and friendliness, which was a notable highlight of my visit. My choice for the day was the advertised house favorite, spaghetti and meatballs, which came at a premium price of $25. While the meatballs were flavorful and the sauce tantalizingly savory, I couldn't help feeling underwhelmed by the portion size, especially given the cost. The dish featured just two small meatballs, which left me wanting more from both a value and volume perspective.

My mom opted for a chicken dish topped with cheese and accompanied by spinach. It was competently prepared but erred on the side of simplicity. Thankfully, the potency of their old fashioned cocktail, with its enticing cherries at the bottom, did not disappoint my taste buds.

A delightful surprise was the complimentary bread served at the table, oozing with what seemed to be melted cheese within its warm folds—truly a treat for our palates.

In summary, the meal was enjoyable with good flavors all round, but the portion sizes didn't quite match up to the prices. I'm open to giving the restaurant another try for dinner, hopeful that perhaps a different choice from the menu will leave me more impressed.",1
16262,"In these unprecedented times, the launch of a new bakery is indeed a newsworthy event, and this charming establishment does not disappoint. Embracing the essence of Sicily, the bakery offers a delightful array of goods, from artisanal breads to delectable pastries, all perfectly complemented by outstanding coffee.

Upon my visit, I had the pleasure of indulging in their chocolate profiteroles and chocolate bombolini, accompanied by a beautifully crafted cappuccino, all for a modest sum of $14.70. The value is unquestionable, with each item prepared with passion and precision on-site.

While every bite was a treat, the bombolini stole the show—a veritable explosion of chocolate that invigorates the palate. The warmth and courtesy of the staff further amplify the experience, making you feel right at home.

In heartfelt appreciation for a delightful experience, I say, ""Mille Grazie"" to this little gem of a bakery. Highly recommended for anyone seeking both quality and comfort in a bite.",1
15905,"Title: Hit-and-Miss at This Cozy Italian Eatery

I recently dined at a charming Italian restaurant that left me with mixed feelings. While the ambiance was welcoming and the vibe positive, some of the menu items failed to impress. The burrata and fried calamari lacked the punch I was hoping for, and the eggplant dish didn't hit the mark either. Most disappointing was the pasta, which, for an Italian establishment, was surprisingly subpar—a real letdown for any carb enthusiast.

However, not all was lost. The lamb meatballs were a savory delight, the veal parmesan was cooked to perfection, and the chicken dish truly stood out for its excellent flavor. These dishes alone would entice me to give the restaurant another visit.

In summary, while not every dish was a winner, the restaurant offered enough delicious options to keep me considering a return, complemented by an agreeable dining atmosphere.",1
20917,"Honestly, the food was very good, but it was the decor that won me over. In hindsight I wish I took pics of it. We came for the start of their spring menu, so they'd transformed the restaurant into a woodsy atmosphere with cherry blossoms and budding vines. They were playing soulful music like The Spinners and Aretha Franklin so that was a big plus for me too. My friend mentioned that they'd played rock the last time they were there.To eat, we had the hamachi appetizer and I had the cavatelli. Everything had great presentation and they played around with some great tastes. The complimentary bread for instance, had a sweeter hint to it and it came with a creamy garlic butter & breaded mushrooms (with a hint of citrus) on the side. My friend got the oatmeal ice cream which came on graham cracker bread crumbs. Definitely a fan of its uniqueness and hoping to catch each season.",0
15099,"Title: A Sushi Gem for the Spontaneous Diner

Review:
I've found my go-to sushi haven that is perfect for a quick yet exquisite bite. This charming spot operates on a first-come, first-serve basis, meaning no reservations, but it's absolutely worth the spontaneity. The sushi is unmistakably fresh, rivaling the quality of high-end establishments, all set in a quaint atmosphere illuminated by candlelight.

Price-wise, it hits the sweet spot – not too pricey, yet far from budget, offering excellent value for the experience. Among my favorite picks is the tuna crispy rice – a mouthwatering must-try. Their specialty rolls also deserve applause, exhibiting both creativity and flavor.

Whether you're out with friends or looking for a cozy date night, this sushi spot should not be missed. Highly recommended for any sushi lover looking for quality without the pretense.",1
15415,"Came down here last minute on a Thursday night. Was on the waitlist for a table for two but ended up finding space at the bar so we ended up sitting there as full dinner menu was available there. We ordered some cocktails - these range between $22-25 each. We ordered the bone in rib to share and three sides - creamed corn, spinach and also fries. All were delish and we were happy. The only thing that's different by sitting at the bar is you don't get the bread basket. Not sure if it would have been given had we asked though. The chocolate cake looks delicious as always but we didn't have any room left...",0
16908,"Just had dinner here. Was my third trip during restaurant week and once again did not disappoint in the slightest. Ordered empanadas, salmon and reverse cookies and milk. All delicious. Ate upstairs for the first time which was nice. This spot pulls out all the stops when it comes to decor and the experience. Every food item is more of a work of art than just a part of the meal. As I'm sure you already know, this place had a full-service pawn shop operating in the front where you enter with a door in the back leading to the restaurant. Really interesting touch and it's also the only restaurant on it's side of the block which in and of itself makes it seem more original.",0
17473,"My bf and I came here on Valentine's Day. It's a very family-oriented place. I ordered white fish. The way they place food was very blunt. Vegetables were half dipped into the broth.

20408,"Title: Chinatown Gem Offering Bang for Your Buck!

I recently visited a charming, no-frills spot tucked away in Chinatown. The service was prompt; I was seated immediately at a cozy corner table. My choice for the evening was the #25 - spicy chicken huimei, modestly priced at $7.50.

The chicken was remarkably tender, effortlessly falling off the bone, and the dish itself was a delightful, soupy concoction that proved to be the perfect, hearty meal. It's especially satisfying after enjoying a few drinks. The affordability of this place really struck me – with just $9 spent, including tip, I relished a top-notch bowl of noodles.

This unassuming eatery delivers exceptional value and flavors that punch well above their weight. For anyone looking for wallet-friendly, mouthwatering cuisine, this place is unbeatable. Remember to swing by with cash – it's the only payment they accept, but trust me, it's well worth the ATM stop.",1
18135,"Title: A Charming Spot for a Date and a Unique Pasta Experience

My dining experience at this lovely establishment exceeded expectations, making it an ideal spot for a romantic brunch date. Upon arrival, the serene ambiance was noticeable as the place was pleasantly uncrowded.

The highlight of the meal was undoubtedly their signature mafaldi ""scampi."" The dish stood out with perfectly al dente noodles, each strand generously coated with a delightful crunch from the breadcrumbs – a unique and memorable take on pasta.

For something a bit simpler, we opted for the eggs in purgatorio from their brunch menu. It was a comforting and well-executed dish, though akin to a classic shakshuka which one might easily whip up at home.

All in all, it's a spot worth visiting, especially for their exceptional pasta that offers a taste you won't easily find elsewhere.",1
14708,"Eric, Eddie, and Ryan are very down-to-earth, friendly bartenders who made my friends and me feel very welcome. Thank you for taking special care of us and our entire cohort, especially among such a large crowd. Things to know before coming here - there are no outlets, but there's a pay-to-use charging station. It's a super college atmosphere, so it's very loud, crowded, and uncomfortable. Most people are wasted and enjoying their new privilege of drinking and being away from their parents. It's not uncommon to find girls throwing up in the bathroom or outside. There are plenty of TVs, so it's great to watch a game. There's beer bong on both floors. Stools are available, but limited, so catch them while you can. There's several coat hooks throughout the place. And finally, for a sports bar, the food is actually pretty good!",0

For the price we paid, I wish they had offered real wasabi roots instead of the paste. - Russian mule, nice and sweet- ginger drink, I forgot the full name of this cocktail but it was light and sweet.

After a long day at a midtown work conference, my girlfriend and I were in dire need of a good drink and conveniently stumbled upon this gem just steps from her apartment. Serendipitously, we managed to grab the last two bar stools available. Tony, our bartender, proved his mixology mettle by serving up the most fabulous dirty martinis. Accompanied by their equally awesome fried olives, we each reveled in two rounds of excellently crafted libations. This spot definitely secured a return visit from us, especially when the craving for a top-notch dirty martini strikes again.",1
15005,"Happened to be in the area and was happy to come across this Japanese restaurant. It was quite busy on a Friday evening and luckily we got seated at the counter. There was a long line when we left. The restaurant is not huge but does have seatings in the front and back of the restaurant.Staff was friendly and service was quick. We opted for the hot soba tempura and sashimi combo. Same price whether you choose S, M or L so of course we went for large. Soup was good as it wasn't greasy. Sashimi was fresh and tempura was nice and crunchy. You also can choose one mochi or ice cream and we chose sesame ice cream. Portion was big enough to share. Since I wasn't too hungry, the mini curry pork rice was perfect for me. Would definitely love to come back when we are in the hood again.",0
13074,"Title: A Late Night Delight at a Renowned Kosher Haven

I finally made it to the much-talked-about spot in Jewish and kosher circles for a late dinner, and it didn't disappoint. Our waiter, a memorable bald gentleman with a unique accent, was exceptional in service and attentiveness.

This place is not your average ""burger joint""; the prices may reflect that, being on the higher side, but it's wholly justified considering it's kosher.

The standout for me was the LARGE portions. Prepare your appetite! The stuffed burger is a masterpiece, with two patties sandwiching a generous helping of pastrami and caramelized onions. Although my photo doesn't do it justice, trust me, it's a ""wow"" on the taste buds (and yes, sans fried onions for my girlfriend's preferences).

The pastrami on the side was equally remarkable, rich in flavor and generously sauced. The pulled beef Cesar salad also left a lasting impression, proving that greens can be just as indulging.

I skipped the fries this time around due to my keto commitment, but I'm sure they would've been a hit.

In conclusion, this place earns an unwavering 5-star rating from me. A definite shoutout and a promise to return!",1
19479,"The empanada's are so delicious here, and I'm so excited to go back and get some more. I had the pizza empanada and the cheese and guava one for dessert.

144,"Title: A Flavorful Bargain for Korean Curry Lovers

I recently dined at this gem of a restaurant and was thoroughly impressed with their take on Korean curry. While it's less thick than its Japanese counterpart, the flavors are equally robust and satisfying. The sets on offer are a great bargain, especially considering they include both the curry and a delectable katsu topping - a perfect combination even for those who, like me, aren't enthusiastic about soda that's also included.

Ordering à la carte doesn't provide the same value, as the curry alone won't come with any katsu or fried chicken; these would need to be ordered separately. Doing the math, the set is undoubtedly the better deal unless you're after something else on the menu.

What's not to love about DELICIOUS food at a great price? Their weekday lunch special is just $10, which is an absolute steal. Just a heads-up: this special isn't available on weekends, which is a bit of a letdown. Nonetheless, I highly recommend a visit to savor their Korean curry offerings!",1
2070,"Lions and Tigers and Squares is a diamond in the rough of Manhattan's pizza scene—a delightful surprise that brings the authentic taste of Detroit-style pizza to New York City. Referred to me by a friend, this eatery has proven to be more than just another recommendation; it's a revelation.

Opt for a small pie or go big with Barbie's big pie—either way, you're in for a treat. The prices are a pleasant surprise, especially for Manhattan, offering a slice of Motor City without the need to hop on a plane.

While it may not outshine the top Detroit pizzerias, Lions and Tigers and Squares stands its ground admirably. The pizza is indulgent, with a perfect crust that would rank highly even if it were in Michigan. It's a rare find that offers a genuine taste of Detroit's best, served up with a side of cheeky charm.

The menu does have its share of ""fancy"" varieties, but traditionalists will find solace in the classic offerings that stay true to Detroit's legacy. And for those skeptical about venturing beyond NYC's iconic pizza, this spot is a game-changer.

Lions and Tigers and Squares isn’t just about New York or Detroit—it’s a testament to the science of pizza-making, effortlessly proving that when it comes to a great pie, it's all about the quality, authenticity, and love baked into every bite. I extend heartfelt thanks to Yael for steering me towards this Manhattan gem, and to you, I say—be daring, be adventurous, and give Lions and Tigers and Squares a try. You won't regret it.",1
11022,"Pretty solid tacos in the middle of Chelsea Market. You order at the front and give your receipt to one of the workers further down the line.

It's pretty fast if you get tacos but quesadillas and mulas will take longer.The Adobada is pretty spicy in my opinion but they drop some pineapples to help bring it down a bit. Carne asada was juicy. Tacos are pretty decent size but I was still hungry after eating two. The tortilla itself was delicious thought I also got the especial, its basically a taco but the shell is fried cheese. Meat can be added for $2 so I added adobada. It was so good and the fried cheese added the perfect amount of flavor and crunch to the adobada. I definitely recommend trying this if you like cheese.They're good tacos but a bit pricey. I live in San Diego and you can definitely get just as good tacos for a cheaper price. But overall, a good meal!",0
16272,"Upon learning that the owners of my beloved falafel hub, Taim, had opened a new venture, I eagerly headed there for brunch, my expectations soaring. The experience did not disappoint. Immersed in a delightful ambiance, my taste buds were equally pampered. A standout was the ginger mimosa—an impeccable choice for its invigorating zest.

The chilaquiles claimed the spotlight as my personal favorite, a harmonious blend of flavors and textures. Supporting acts, like the robust papas bravas and the smooth, rich hummus, contributed to the culinary symphony. Given the popularity of the place, a word to the wise: secure a reservation to avoid disappointment. Overall, an emphatic thumbs-up for the food, atmosphere, and service.",1
15758,"Title: A Warm Embrace of Traditional Chinese Flavors at The Tang

My evening at The Tang can only be described as a cozy, flavor-filled delight. Stepping in at 5 pm on a Saturday, my boyfriend and I were promptly seated, a perk of our local status. The star of our meal was the Braised Beef Noodle Soup priced at $15. Its tender, generously portioned meat danced in a well-seasoned broth with just the right kick of spice, though the soft-boiled egg's yolk slightly clashed with the dish. A dash more Bok Choy would've perfected the serving.

We also tried the Dan Dan Noodles for $13. They were satisfactory, yet lacked the punch of spice and moisture necessary to elevate them to greatness. The Garlic Pork Dumplings, however, did not disappoint. For $8.50, we got a hearty serving packed with tantalizing flavor.

The service was cordial and efficient, with dishes arriving swiftly, though the premature presentation of the bill made us feel hurried in an otherwise empty restaurant. Though prices run higher than some alternatives, the portion sizes warrant the cost. My taste buds are already calling me back to The Tang for the Herbal Chicken Noodle Soup.",1
14366,Delighted with our Sunday brunch choice here. I've always been a fan of Mexicue for lunch and dinner but never had brunch and glad I did! The huevos rancheros with smoked carnitas and the over easy eggs made this like a Mexican Benedict. Wow. So good! It normally comes with scrambled but I highly recommend the over easy for that yolky goodness! Mmmmm. Service was super welcoming and friendly. This will be a local staple here on out!,0
14888,Order the unagi bowl and it was delishhhhh. Good quality eel :)This place is reminiscent of if chipotle and japan had a baby lol. This place is much smaller inside than the pictures make it appear. Not really good for groups as the seating arrangement in here could probably only fit about 10 people in total. Not a great space for kids/baby's either. Recommended for people just interested in grabbing a tasty lunch and heading out after.,0
16573,"One of my favorite restaurants in New York is a Senegalese restaurant (in Brooklyn) so I'm always on the lookout for this cuisine. The official dish of Senegal, the Thiéboudienne is a deeply flavorful, well balanced dish of fish, stewed vegetables, and delicious red rice. I crave it often, but don't come by it on the regular. So it was with high hopes that I walked into Pikine, one of the higher rated Senegalese eateries in Harlem, of which there are many. I'll start with the food. The Thiéboudienne came out within 5 minutes after I ordered it, which I raised an eyebrow at as it was clear that the food had been pre-made and just heated up. Maybe that's just the nature of stews and rice-- you don't make that stuff to order. In terms of flavor, the food was pretty tasty, though the dish was mostly rice, with not enough vegetables or fish. Service wise, I wish they were more attentive. I don't care about friendliness at all, but I would hope we would get served water, that we wouldn't have to flag our server every time we wanted our glasses refilled, when we wanted to take our orders, and then remind them about our drink and side orders. Our server could not be bothered.The speediness and the service would be totally satisfactory at a quick service restaurant. It feels funny at a sit down dinner format, with sit down dinner prices.",0
16899,"I recently ordered the quarantine special for takeout from a local eatery through chownow.com and had a fantastic experience. The deal was incredibly value-packed, offering 20 wings and 4 beers for just $28. I chose a split of honey mustard and hot buffalo flavors for the wings. Upon arrival, my order was ready within minutes, and though the beer selection was pre-packaged, it was decent enough to round out the meal.

The wings were fresh out of the kitchen and truly enjoyable. While the hot buffalo wings lacked a bit of the fiery punch I expected, they were still satisfying. The honey mustard wings were perfectly saucy and hit the spot. For the price, the quality and quantity of food were more than reasonable, and the thoughtful addition of separating sanitized and used pens for customers showed attention to detail and care for safety. I'll certainly be ordering from here again!",1
3088,"Calle Dao is a vibrant and eclectic place to grab a quick drink at the bar, or catch up with friends in their dining area in the back. Some things were absolute hits, and some were absolute misses. The hits were the salmon and the paella. SO FLAVORFUL! My boyfriend has eaten lots of paella, and he said it was the best by far because of the unique flavors. Also the shrimp chips that are served for a complimentary appetizer are amazing-very unique flavor as well!  The misses were the vegetarian mushroom and broccoli noodles as well as their rice and beans.There were only 2 veggie options on the menu to begin with. The tofu stir fry was very good (4/5). The mushroom and broccoli noodles...terrible, I really should have sent it back. The dish was extremely salty (and I love salt) and the mushrooms almost tasted rancid. Totally unacceptable! The vegetarian entrees need improvement. The rice and beans were disappointing as well ESPECIALLY for a Cuban restaurant! They were lacking in flavor and just didn't have the texture or authenticity of Cuban rice and beans. Everything else about this establishment was wonderful and I would have given 5 stars if it weren't for the extremely salty noodle dish and the bland rice and beans. Another thing I appreciated was the service. Despite how busy it was, there was always someone coming around to make sure everyone's water glass was filled. If you're not vegetarian, this place is a must visit!",0
14615,"Walked by this place and decided to have dinner) despite it being conspicuously empty on a Friday night) based on the positive reviews here. We had a squash soup (special) to start that was really beautifully seasoned. Then I had the churrasco (which I imagine is a basic b kind of choice, akin to ordering pad Thai at a Thai place), my BF had the hanger steak (vacio a la gaucho), and we got a side of the creamed kale.I thoroughly enjoyed mine. It was very nice beef, perfectly cooked. (General tip about steak at Argentinian restaurants- their standards of ""doneness"" are a bit different from what we use in the U.S., in that they tend to cook it more. This is normal and I like to have it their way, but if you really want your meat medium rare, you might want to exaggerate and say ""rare."") I expected the side of greens to be just a lazy pile of lettuce, but it was dressed in a nice vinaigrette that balanced the steak well. The chimichurri is the best part, and they give you plenty of extra on the side, including a different spicy one that is more orangey in color and delicious. The creamed kale was MUY RICO but really good. We couldn't finish it.They have a nice regional wine list, too, and great service.This is not an all-the-time kind of place for me because it's a bit pricey. But I've been to Argentina in the past- loved it- and the freshness and simplicity of the food here really brought back memories of that. In fact, while eating I began making plans to go back this fall... soooo, more expensive meal than anticipated. ;)",0
19557,"I visited The Smith for brunch at 10:30 AM on a Saturday and was pleasantly surprised to be seated immediately without any wait. The service started on a high note with complimentary bread, a delightful touch not often found at brunch spots. I opted for the eggs Benedict, which was quite tasty, though not the best I've ever enjoyed. The dish was somewhat let down by the bread base, which was tough and seemed stale. However, the accompanying potatoes were a triumph, thoroughly enjoyable and satisfying. Despite the minor hiccup, the meal was delicious, and my experience was positive enough to ensure my return to The Smith.",1
18493,"So I came here not really sure what to expect. Was this going to be just like Korean BBQ? Well, no it isn't. Think Vietnamese meats and flavors served Korean BBQ style. We did the 7 course meat tasting as well as the prawns and uni. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. The flavoring was totally on point. It's everything I love about Vietnamese food minus the bowls of pho. I do have a handful of comments that could make the place better:1. They need more staff. The place gets busy and the servers/tableside cooks get overwhelmed resulting in some meats being overcooked. 2. The ventilation needs to be better. I felt like I was cooked during my meal. And I definitely smelled of grilled meats afterwards. 3. The uni had a bit too much butter in it. It shouldn't need any seasoning. Overall I enjoyed the place and would be back. Do note that they currently do not have a liquor or beer license and do not allow BYOB.",0

20665,"Title: A Satisfying Omakase Experience with Exceptional Hospitality

I recently dined at an omakase restaurant that, while not making my top three in the New York area for value, offered a delightful experience. The staff's friendliness added a touch of warmth to the meal, with our waitress expertly assisting in selecting a complementary sake and ensuring our glasses were never empty. The presumed owner's personal expressions of gratitude for our patronage were a lovely extra.

The cuisine was served in trios, thoughtfully presented from left to right, allowing for an easy culinary journey. Standout bites included the snapper, scallop, needlefish, and chutoro, all served on perfectly cooked rice that did not dominate the palate. The meal concluded with a flavorful three-piece toro hand roll.

The establishment's pricing falls in the middle range – it's costly, though not as steep as Nakazawa or Noz, meaning it remains a treat rather than a regular haunt. A slight disappointment was the missed opportunity to sit at the sushi bar, which did not appear to be an available option.

Celebrating a birthday, the restaurant accommodated us with a modest buttercream cake and a toffee takeaway for the guest of honor, a thoughtful, if not particularly remarkable, gesture. Overall, while the pricing may limit the frequency of visits, the experience and hospitality make it worth considering for those special occasions.",1
18532,"I recently visited a quaint little restaurant that truly exceeded my expectations. Despite its modest size, the value and quality of the food were remarkable, and the prices were very reasonable. 

I was particularly impressed with the speed of service; my order of Pad see ew with shrimp arrived in just 5-10 minutes. The restaurant wasn't crowded during my visit, though I did notice a steady stream of takeout orders being fulfilled. 

The portion size was generous, providing great bang for the buck. Conveniently located within walking distance from my accommodation, this spot is a must-visit for any Thai cuisine enthusiast. I am certainly planning to return on my next trip.",1
18064,"We wanted to go to another dim sum spot but the wait was over 2hrs so we left. We were walking to another dim sum restaurant but we stopped in front of Dim Sum VIP because it smelled so good. I was like yup-I want this. The restaurant was small but we got seated immediately. What I liked that they made it fresh when we ordered it, so it's not like the typical dim sum restaurant where they push food on a cart and you pick off of it. We ordered every dumpling and shumai - we loved it. The pork spareribs were the best we've ever had. Everything was so fresh - I didn't care for the salt and pepper calamari-it was a bit on the salty side but cooked perfectly. We were so stuffed when we left to the point where we didn't want to eat dinner.",0
20258,"A JoJu location in midtown?!? REJOICE!! What a blessing to have this delicious Elmhurst based viet place open a spot right near my work. I, like many others came for the BOGO banh mi deal for opening day. Unfortunately, I came too late and they stopped offering the special and instead had a free drink with a purchase of a bowl, which is definitely not as good of a deal. Regardless, I made the trip so I was determined to get something from here. I ordered the JoJu Bowl which came with carmelized pork and sausage. This the go to bowl for indecisive people like myself because it contains two types of meats. Both are very sweet in flavor but a little different in the taste, which offers some variety in each bite. You absolutely cannot skip out on the runny egg on top, it's the icing on top for sure! When mixed together, there's a medley of flavors from the spicy and sour from the kimchi, to the sweet and salty from the pork. I also ordered a Cold Brew Thai Tea. I'm not sure if this was supposed to be a Thai Iced Tea but if that's the case, it was definitely not as rich and creamy as the drink normally should be. I have a sweet tooth so I would've preferred a little more sugar and cream in there. Overall, the taste is very consistent with the flagship store. However, I'm slightly disappointed in the lack of options in comparison to the store in Elmhurst. Some of my favorites like the pork belly and chicken wings were absent from the menu in midtown and they cut all the drinks out except for three. Regardless, I'm extremely excited that there's now a JoJu in Manhattan to satisfy my banh mi cravings!",0
14262,"Upon my recent visit to the restaurant, I found the culinary experience to be a delightful paradox. The quality of the food was impressive; each dish was a palatable masterpiece with flavors that danced on the tongue, and the presentation was nothing short of artistry. The duck carnitas, while pricey at $98, were succulent and could generously serve two—if supplemented with additional plates.

However, the dining experience was not without its flaws. The portions were modest, which could be disappointing for those with hearty appetites unless prepared to spend a significant sum. Additionally, the ambiance was marred by loud music, making it less than ideal for those seeking convivial conversation.

While the staff was efficient, their impatience for quick and multiple orders was noticeable, casting a shade of discomfort over our mealtime deliberations. In essence, while your taste buds may be in for a treat, be prepared for a potentially hurried and pricey experience that might not cater to relaxed social dining.",1
13681,"Title: Sky-High Delights at Manhattan's Gem

My wife and I celebrated our anniversary with an early dinner at a restaurant renowned for its breathtaking views, and it delivered far beyond its visual spectacle. The moment you step out of the elevator on the 60th floor, you're swept away by the grandeur of Manhattan's skyline, with commanding sights of iconic landmarks like the Empire State Building.

The space is a sprawling rectangle that masterfully balances openness with coziness, affording each patron ample space amidst an energetic bar scene. Service was attentive and seamless, with a friendly and professional staff that seemed to move in perfect synchrony.

The pre-fixe menu—concise yet diverse—ranged from good to exceptional. The Lobster Quenelle appetizer was the star, abundant and fresh. Equally impressive were the Scotch Snails, served with irresistible bread we couldn't help but request seconds of. The Striped Bass entree was the highlight of the main courses, perfectly cooked and delectably flavored, though modest in portion. The Wagyu Coulette, however, fell short, lacking the tenderness expected from such a revered cut.

Desserts, a Warm Date Cake and a Chocolate Mousse, though small, were a delightful tart and sweet end to the meal. The only mar was the crescendo of noise during peak hours, which can intrude on intimate conversations. Nonetheless, the experience was exceptional, even including a celebrity spot of Neil Patrick Harris.

For those enticed by the allure of heights, this venue is a must-visit—not just for the views but also for its commendable cuisine. The perk? Entrance is free, and you don't need to dine to enjoy the bar and Bay Room vistas. Yes, drinks are on the pricier side, but for that view, it’s a worthy splurge.",1
160,"During the quarantine era, I decided to try some takeout from a local spot that caught my eye. The Reuben Egg Roll was an absolute standout; the flavors and textures melded into a delightful snack that was just as comforting as it was innovative. However, the Okra Rice Ball left a bit to be desired. It was predominantly rice, and I struggled to detect the presence of okra, making the name a tad misleading.

The true highlights, though, were the sauces. I opted for the Turmeric Honey Mustard and the Sauerkraut Caraway Yogurt, both of which were phenomenal. They were so flavorful and complemented the dishes perfectly—I found myself wishing I had the foresight to try all the sauce options available. Addicting is an understatement when it comes to these condiments; they could very well be the reason I'll be ordering again soon!",1

The bathrooms were clean though.",0
20242,"Title: Comfortable Fare in the Heart of Times Square

Nestled among the hustle and bustle of Times Square, this average eatery offers a nostalgic atmosphere that may feel slightly outdated to some. With a menu that spans a variety of options, their forte is clearly in the ""bar food"" arena. Our group stuck with a classic choice – burgers, ranging from beef to veggie, to turkey. All were satisfying, particularly when paired with the flavorful chipotle mayo. The fries were reminiscent of those at Wendy's, which could be a plus if you're fond of their style.

While this spot doesn't stand out in Times Square's competitive dining scene, it's a reliable spot for anyone craving a no-frills bar meal in an old-school setting. One drawback, however, was the service, which failed to impress, and the somewhat inconvenient bathroom access requiring a code – a bit of a surprise for a bar environment. It warrants a solid 3-star rating, suitable for those looking for a rustic touch and a decent burger.",1

2814,"Cute spot with friendly service but in my opinion, the quality doesn't reflect the price point.When I open the menu, I was kind of surprised by the prices considering that it's a very casual place and was practically empty. Appetizers range from 25-30, practically upmarket prices. I figured that you get what you pay for and ordered a glass of wine ($12) and tolmas ($17). The wine was alright but I found the food to be a little underwhelming. The order came with five stuffed grape leaves but they were sitting in a bland puddle of water and didn't have much flavor.Considering some of the fabulous meals I've had at similar mom-and-pop places, I can't say I was impressed. Maybe I need to come back and order something else but I probably wouldn't go out of my way.",0
15788,"Title: A Casual Ambiance with Hits and Misses

My recent visit to this restaurant, as part of a large group, was a memorable one, mainly for its casual and welcoming atmosphere. We were comfortably seated center-stage on a long table flanked by booth seating on one side and chairs on the other, surrounded by the simple elegance of pale wood and a tasteful display of wine bottles and photography.

The highlight of my meal was undoubtedly the Thai iced tea; a delightful concoction that struck the perfect balance between sweet, creamy, and refreshing. It set a high bar for the rest of the meal.

For the entree, I settled on the grilled pork chop over the crab fried rice. While it wasn't an easy choice, the pork chop, garnished with attractive grill marks, was succulent and flavorful, basking in a savory-sweet marinade that did not disappoint.

The accompanying vegetables, however, were a letdown – hard and lacking in that just-right cooked quality. The sticky rice, served in an adorable cube dish, was a tad underwhelming, missing the mark on both taste and texture.

Service was a high point; the staff capably managed our large gathering with friendliness and efficiency. While some aspects of the food left room for improvement, the reasonable prices soften the critique.

Would I revisit? There's potential here, and the untried Crab Fried Rice, along with other menu items, might just beckon a return visit.",1

Impressively, they serve up your order with lightning speed, typically ready within 10-15 minutes. Don't expect a fiery kick unless you specifically ask for it, as dishes are tailored to a milder palate by default. I'd wholeheartedly recommend it and will definitely be ordering from here again.",1

I recently discovered a gem of a restaurant that immediately secured its spot as my new favorite after-work hangout. With its tantalizing tropical theme, the ambiance set the stage for a delightful Friday evening with friends.

Despite arriving during the peak hour of 6 PM, the bustling crowd did not dampen our spirits. Although the self-seating policy meant a bit of a wait, the vibrant atmosphere paired with an enticing happy hour kept us more than content. The frozen margaritas are an absolute must-try!

As luck would have it, we scored the coveted beach chair table as the evening progressed. Patience pays off, as tables freed up later, suggesting a short wait should deter no one. The unique touch of a cute bottle to signal waitstaff to our table when ordering was both practical and charming.

The shareable guac with customizable toppings was a hit among us, and my chicken tacos were nothing short of delicious. The attentive service, marked by frequent check-ins, was the cherry on top of an already enjoyable experience.

In summary, this restaurant is a slice of tropical paradise in midtown, perfect for unwinding after work with great food, drinks, and ambiance.",1

It may seem poignant to review a restaurant on the cusp of closure, but my recent lunch at this beloved spot compels me to reflect on an experience I've longed for throughout my New York journey. Securing a midday reservation allowed me to finally step through its doors, and the experience did not disappoint.

The opening act of salumi and a chef-curated cheese selection set a high bar, delighting us with its quality and taste. The gnocchi I chose as my main course was nothing short of incredible, a sentiment echoed by my companions, each enamored with their own selections. The scallops special, a shared indulgence, underscored our collective culinary joy.

12810,"After walking 20 minutes in the freezing cold winter weather in NY, we opted to check out Ichiran to see what the fuss was all about. This place exceeded my expectations in every way. From service to the ramen, all spot on and left me desiring to come back ASAP. By now, you've scrolled through the multitudes of reviews, so you know now that this is a non-tipping establishment. What a great way to start a meal! After about 10 minutes of waiting, we saw four open spots on the innovative booth display. The staff person told us to head over to our booths. I ordered the Tonkotsu ramen ""light"" all the way for the dashi, oil, and spice. After about 10 minutes, a server rolled up the screen and placed my ramen in front of me. After another 10 minutes, I devoured it. If you're big eater, you'll need to order the kae-dama, which is an extra order of noodles. Luckily for us, the kae-dama was free due to some promo. With my kae-dama order, I also requested a side of black vinegar or Osukaran in Japanese. Apparently, it's homemade. I added a few drops of it into my soup and, wow, it really enhanced the overall umami of the the broth. I highly recommend it. When compared to other ramen places I've been to, what sets this place apart is the Tonkotsu broth and the ramen noodles. The broth was very flavorful, but not heavy it all. Keep in mind I did order mine light on the oil. The noodles were stretchy and each bite was perfect. For the area, I found the prices reasonable, but quite expensive since I don't live in NY. Service was hospitable and the overall restaurant well ran and clean.Enjoy slurping!",0

I recently dined at Wok Wok for the first time, and it did not disappoint! The restaurant boasts a vibrant atmosphere, enhanced by artsy decor and strategic lighting, making it a visually appealing experience. Admittedly, the noise level was higher than expected, but it's a small trade-off for the lively ambiance of the place.

The culinary highlight of our visit was the flavorful Pad Thai with pork, and the Traditional Nasi Lemak with beef - a sumptuous Malaysian specialty. Both dishes were a testament to the authenticity and quality of the cuisine offered at Wok Wok.

Service was another bright spot, with the team exuding friendliness, contributing positively to our dining experience. To sweeten the deal, Wok Wok has a treat for Yelp users; checking in gets you a complimentary Thai iced tea, which was both refreshing and delightful.

A word of advice to future patrons - be aware that a 15% service fee is added to your bill, not intended for the servers. Cash is king here, as that's all they accept, and tipping is at your discretion.

Overall, my recommendation stands strong: if you find yourself in the vicinity, make a point to visit Wok Wok. It's a great destination for anyone looking to indulge in delicious Asian cuisine within an electric setting.",1

I recently swapped my usual El Camion Sunday brunch for a new culinary experience, and I wasn't disappointed. The place, birthed from the dreams of a Puebla-native female chef funded by VC, presents an authentic dive into the region's flavors.

Their standout dish, the cemita sandwich, was a new sight to me – a sesame seed bun creation tempting enough to lure any food enthusiast. However, I decided on the tamal benedict, a delightful fusion of traditional Mexican fare and a brunch classic, accompanied by a well-dressed salad. It was a clever twist that didn’t disappoint, although there’s now a growing curiosity for the cemita.

My partner’s choice of steak and eggs exceeded expectations, with a steak cooked to tender, rosy perfection. And while there were murmurings of bland guacamole in past reviews, our experience was quite the opposite; it was bursting with the right balance of cilantro, salt, and citrus.

The brunch deal was a steal - $18 for two hours of unlimited drinking with a versatile choice of beverages, and we couldn’t resist the 2-for-1 margarita special, a bonus.

The ambiance was comfortable for a 1:30 PM Sunday - not too crowded, but reservations might be wise for larger groups. While the guacamole portion could be more generous given its $14 price tag, the quality was spot-on with freshly made, hot chips.

By the end of our meal, the sight of chilaquiles at the neighboring table already had me planning my next visit. A return is certainly on the horizon, with a few menu items calling my name. This new spot is worth the try for anyone looking to explore the richness of Puebla's palette in a brunch setting.",1
19020,"Title: A Must-Visit for Taco Enthusiasts – Los Tacos No. 1

If you're a taco aficionado wandering around Chelsea Market, you simply can't miss Los Tacos No. 1. Despite the daunting line, rest assured it zips by, and the bustling atmosphere is part of the charm.

Local chatter unanimously points taco lovers to this spot, and trust me, it lives up to the hype. The adobada and asada tacos are a flavor fiesta, with their taste only rivaled by the equally fabulous chips and guacamole.

Don't let the lack of seating deter you; the tacos are so delectable, you'll forget about sitting down. Los Tacos No. 1 is the epitome of taco greatness, and while this location is stand-and-eat, other locations might offer a spot to sit. Either way, make sure to try the adobada tacos for an unforgettable experience. Two thumbs up for Los Tacos No. 1!",1
10355,"Title: Unforgettable Tonkotsu Ramen Experience

I finally had the chance to visit the much-acclaimed ramen spot I'd missed out on in Japan, and let me tell you, it was worth the wait. The star of the show was their popular Tonkotsu Ramen, ordered with the recommended medium level for all add-ons. From the moment the order was taken to the ramen's arrival – which was under 15 minutes – the service was brisk and no-nonsense, capturing that authentic efficiency I remember from Japan.

The broth, a thick and sumptuous concoction, was a tad oily but paired divinely with the kick of red pepper. It's a hearty flavor that may lead me to choose a lighter option next time, though. The noodles deserve a standing ovation; they were exemplary in their ability to latch onto the soup, ensuring each slurp was packed with flavor. A minor quibble was having to peel the egg myself; a convenience I missed.

In essence, this place offers an exceptional ramen experience with service that matches its culinary standards. I cannot overstate how delectable it was – you'll need to taste it yourself to truly understand. Highly recommended!",1
13891,"I recently stopped by this restaurant for a late dinner and had a delightful experience. We indulged in four different pizza pies, and the Honey Badger instantly won me over. Its unique combination of pepperoni with a hint of spice, perfectly balanced by a touch of sweetness from the honey, was simply irresistible. Each pizza was freshly prepared with a deliciously skinny crust. We also enjoyed a side of Brussels sprouts, which was a tasty addition to our meal. Overall, a highly recommended spot for pizza lovers!",1
1504,"Title: A Greek Gem in the Soho Scene - Lola Tavern

When you step into Lola Tavern, you're instantly welcomed by an atmosphere that is as vibrant and lively as a spirited gathering on a Greek island. This Soho-style gem truly impressed with its sleek interior and prompt, friendly service that elevates the dining experience.

The cocktail offerings are a highlight, providing a perfect kickstart to the culinary journey. As for the food, the PIKILIA platter with grilled pita is a great way to sample an array of flavors, with the tzatziki and muhamarra being personal standouts.

The grilled octopus was exemplary, tender and dressed simply with capers, olive oil, and vinegar to let its natural flavors shine through. While the spanakopita spring rolls did not quite hit the mark for me and might be the one dish I'd skip on a return visit, the chicken gyro bao buns were a revelation – a fusion dish done right with the pickled cucumbers adding a delightful crunch.

But the star of the show was undoubtedly the grilled lamb chops, sourced from Opal Valley Farms, accompanied by perfectly roasted lemon potatoes. These chops are a must-order and come in a set of three, making them a satisfying choice for any meat lover.

In summary, my dining experience at Lola Tavern was nothing short of splendid. It's a place I'll be revisiting, not just for the exceptional flavors and cocktails, but for the overall joy it brings to the table. Lola Tavern is a must-visit for anyone craving a contemporary twist to traditional Greek cuisine.",1

15446,"Definitely an Instagram trap. The all-pink restaurant is famous all over social media, and while ""Pink as Fuck"" is pretty cute; the food here isn't worth the price. I had the risotto and while it was yummy, I'm sure I could've found equal quality elsewhere for a lesser price. The place is very nice though as literally everything is pink. The iconic washroom print that everyone seems to take a picture of is admittedly very cool but the washroom itself is very small so don't expect to take all-angle photos lol. The space is very cramped so I imagine it gets pretty busy. Also, they only take cash and AMEX so if you don't have either expect to use the ATM they have in the back. Worth trying at least once!",0
17796,"Came here for dinner on a Friday night... the service was very hospitable, the cocktails were great and the food was delicious! They had a DJ playing a nice mix of lowkey house tunes and afrobeats that provided a nice ambiance, and I was glad to see the place was comfortably filled.  Also, shout out to them for providing warm bread at the table while you wait for your meal... it's the little things. I'll definitely be back to try more of their menu as the hanger steak dish and the African mussels that I had have set the bar high already.",0
16071,"Absolutely amazing restaurant. Very polished, perfect interior. Not overstated. The food is absolutely insane. No detail is overlooked. If it is, Maria the chef/owner is all over it.

Thank you for such an amazing experience!!!",0
10423,"Title: Cozy Breakfast Spot with Simple Fare

I recently stopped by this quaint little breakfast joint and found myself charmed by its simplicity. The space is indeed compact, featuring a kitchen, an ordering counter, and just a couple of small tables that can seat no more than eight patrons at a time.

My meal kicked off with a small beef rice noodle roll priced at $2.50. It was a decent offering, where the noodles themselves were notably thin and light, although the beef pieces tucked inside were just okay in terms of flavor.

Next up were the curry fish balls, also at $2.50. These didn't particularly stand out, as they tasted quite similar to something you could pick up from a local grocery store. The curry sauce they were bathed in was satisfactory, but nothing to write home about.

Heads-up for future visitors, this spot is a cash-only establishment, so be sure to have some bills on hand before you drop by. Overall, it's a modest place for a quick and tasty breakfast if you're in the area and in need of a simple bite.",1
16059,"My recent visit to this unique eatery offered a delightful twist: catching our own fish, which certainly added to the fun. I appreciated the option to choose two cooking styles for each fish we caught; the execution of these dishes did not disappoint.

On the downside, the appetizers were a letdown due to their diminutive portions—the stewed beef, in particular, was disappointingly scant. Thankfully, the croquette was a standout, leaving a lasting impression with its delicious taste. The salad, fresh and well-dressed, was another highlight of our meal.

Dessert ended on a high note with a luscious matcha tiramisu that was as delightful in taste as it was in presentation. Service, while passable, tended towards the slower side, but the cozy corner table provided a sense of privacy, adding to our overall comfortable dining experience.",1
10289,"Seemingly out of place dive bar in the Upper East Side. Dark interior with lots of seating both inside and outside. Relatively quiet for a Saturday evening, as we were easily able to get a table for three people.One of the staples of this spot is their affordable bar food (for the area). Wasn't in the mood for a burger, so decided on the Nachos w/Chorizo ($14), to go along with my beer ($8). Nachos are a mess of chips, cheese, lettuce, beans, peppers, and meat. Cheese and beans were good, not enough chorizo and too much lettuce. Service is a little up and down. We tried to order at the bar, but it's table service (she didn't really come around often), so we ended up ordering at the bar anyway. Something different in the area for sure, if you want to get away from the normal riff raff.",0
11582,"My second time at Ai Fiori, this time for Restaurant Week. Absolutely love the location and that of course it's inside The Langham Hotel, which is understated chic.The hostess promptly got us seated and gave us a great table. We went for a glass of Champagne each and went ahead with the restaurant week menu. Service was very attentive but not hurried. They brought bread and butter to the table, which I chose not to have given that I knew I'd be indulging in carb-land. For starters, hubby and I both went for the egg, and it was so simple yet good. For main dishes, I had the truffle pasta (sooo divine!! Still dreaming about those freshly shaved truffle!) and hubby had the prawns which were so fresh and delicious! I also wanted him to try the Trofie Nero pasta which honestly is one of the dishes that made Chef Michael White so famous and he loved it! As for dessert, I went for the olive oil cake which was delish and he went for the chocolate mouse raspberry dish. Both so yummy! Oh and by the way, we couldn't resist trying their gelato so we ordered a scoop of pistachio, and that sealed the day. Overall, such an excellent dining experience! Expect nothing less from this Michelin-star Italian NYC institution!",0

I am obsessed with ricotta and short rib and they were made to perfection. The potatoes with the short rib were perfect. The cauliflower and spaghetti was meh and I did not like the pork chop. Ambience: 5/5: busy, nice, dimly lit spot. Music playing in the background. everyone is loud and lively. We fortunately got seated in the back in a room which was quieter and nice. Service: 5/5: the staff did an amazing job and were courteous",0
2646,"Title: A Disappointing Mediterranean Misadventure

My experience at this new Mediterranean takeout spot in the bustling office district was underwhelming, to say the least. Despite their convenient location, they seem to misunderstand that the key to success is the quality and flavor of the food, not just the venue.

The presentation felt careless, with dishes thoughtlessly tossed into a bowl. The hummus had an off-putting taste; I struggle to even describe what was wrong with it. The falafel balls were an unfortunate low point, being grossly undercooked and contributing to an overall bland and unsatisfying meal. After struggling to eat a mere quarter of the bowl, I found it inedible and ultimately gave up.

While the food left much to be desired, I must give credit where it's due—the staff was cordial and attentive. However, good service can't compensate for the poor dining experience. I can only hope they take this feedback to heart and improve. For now, I'm offering two stars, solely for the staff's kindness.",1
19710,"Title: A Pleasant, Yet Underwhelming Culinary Experience

My boyfriend and I eagerly made a reservation a month in advance, anticipating a dining experience that would leave us in awe. Unfortunately, our meal, although pleasant, fell short of our high expectations. Our shared plates included a selection of pasta: Agnolotti with pumpkin, Garganelli, and Cappelletti. While each was tasty, none managed to dazzle us, particularly when compared to the outstanding pastas we've enjoyed at Lilia. The Agnolotti suffered from a slightly too-thick dough, diminishing the overall texture.

The side of Brussels sprouts, although flavorful, seemed as if they had been over-boiled, losing that perfect bite. Among the pastas, the Garganelli did emerge as the most memorable, hinting at the potential for excellence the kitchen possesses.

Dessert was a mixed bag. We sampled Mela, an apple dessert, and a scoop of cookies and cream ice cream accompanied by a ginger cookie. The ice cream was delightful, clearly outshining the Mela, which was let down by a lackluster crumble that lacked the anticipated crispness.

On a positive note, the service throughout our meal was commendable. Attentive and efficient staff ensured that our dining experience was smooth, even if the food itself didn't quite hit the mark.

In conclusion, while nothing we tasted was poor, there were no standout ""wow"" moments. Our overall rating is 3.5 stars—good but not extraordinary, leaving us longing for that extra flair that could have turned our meal into something truly special.",1
18781,"After a delightful visit to the MoMA, my husband and I stumbled upon a charming little spot for a quick bite. I indulged in a delectable petite sandwich from their grab-and-go section – a perfect small meal that was both satisfying and convenient.

3204,"On Memorial Day, we decided to dine out for dinner and ended up at this hotel-based restaurant. To our surprise, it was quite spacious and the interior was tastefully decorated, dispelling our initial impression of it being a small venue. 

The place wasn't crowded, which allowed for immediate seating. Our order consisted of the honey bee burger, hot chicken burger, and a side of fries. Both burgers were delicious and satisfying, with the hot chicken burger slightly edging out the honey bee in terms of flavor. The fries were a solid accompaniment, though not extraordinary.

The bill came to a reasonable $40 before tip. The highlight, however, was the exemplary service that made our dining experience even more enjoyable.

19792,"This restaurant is inside Le District. The restaurant is actually really well decorated and feels fancy inside. The service was kind of slow, as it took a while before a waiter came to the table to get our order. I ordered the chefs daily fish selection which was catfish over ratatouille. The entree was kind of small but it was pretty good in flavor. The ratatouille was seasoned well but everything was all mushy and I couldn't really tell what vegetables were what. I also got a side of asparagus and fries. The asparagus were big pieces and came with hollandaise sauce. It was also really soft which I liked. The fries were thick cut but not as crispy as I would've liked. They also have tasty linguine with shrimp! There's big pieces of shrimp and a good saucey linguine. Overall, pricey but pretty good food.",0

Located steps away from the bustling Penn Station at 8th Ave. and 34th St., next to the iconic New Yorker Hotel, this diner might not claim the title of 'best' in the city, but it offers a strategic respite for travelers seeking familiar comfort food. With efficient service and a comprehensive menu brimming with diner staples, it caters to a variety of palates.

I savored the chicken and waffles—a harmonious blend of sweet and savory—while my niece relished her pulled pork sandwich, declaring the accompanying waffle fries 'amazing'. The food here is straightforward and satisfying—no frills, just hearty meals that hit the spot.

Given its prime location adjacent to a hotel, it excels in convenience, although the prices may give those from outside New York a bit of sticker shock. Nonetheless, for hotel guests, train commuters, or anyone passing by, this diner warrants a stop for a reliably good meal.",1

I went daring with my order, choosing a level x5 spiciness that hit the perfect heat without overpowering the dish. My friend, even bolder, opted for x10 with less salt, and was equally pleased with his custom-tuned broth.

We couldn't skip dessert, indulging in a matcha treat that was pleasantly balanced - sweet, but not cloying. The restaurant is also well-suited for solo diners, offering divided booths for privacy and comfort.

I wholeheartedly recommend this place, an easy 10/10 for anyone seeking a true ramen experience.",1

11148,"Title: A Culinary Marvel at Kappo Masa

From the moment my husband and I stepped into Kappo Masa for our omakase lunch experience, we knew we were in for a treat. The entire team, including our adept chef Jackie, attentive server Kim, and the fantastic manager Rachel, created an atmosphere of care and excellence that elevated our dining experience.

But let's talk about the main event: the food. Each dish was a masterpiece of flavors, with the fish, uni, eel, and beef all delivering a 'melt-in-your-mouth' sensation that was nothing short of sublime. The shrimp pasta was remarkable, but it was the roasted uni on the half shell that stole the show. This dish was so exquisitely good, it brought me to the brink of tears.

Surrounded by original artwork, including a Picasso, the ambiance of Kappo Masa was as impressive as the cuisine. To cap off this culinary journey, the Lady M cake provided a sweet finale to what can only be described as one of the best meals of my life. Kappo Masa isn't just a meal; it's a full-fledged sensory experience.",1
20232,"I read the reviews before coming & maybe I had just hyped it up in my head? We got the juicy pork dumplings, dumpling platter, salt & pepper squid & 5 spice braised duck. Oh and a glass of wine. I honestly wasn't in love with anything. At best, it was mediocre. The squid was cooked perfectly, I'll give it that. Barely any seasoning. A good bit of salt but no other flavor and the breading is thick. It's like the sweet & sour chicken breading some Chinese places use. Never in my life have I seen a Chinese restaurant bread squid like that. Actually, I was surprised to see zero tentacles. Where's my baby squid? I dipped it in all the sauces they gave but it was still just mediocre at best. The sauce for the duck was awesome but the duck was 99% thick squishy fat and bone/cartilage. Disappointing. Their chili oil sauce tastes old, it's not even spicy. I ate blobs of it & it just tastes like oil. The portions we're bigger than expected but their dim sum is expensive.. I guess location matters. This isn't a spot for Asians to appreciate. I was the most asian in there aside from the staff .. so that should've hinted at how good it'd be probably. The dumpling platter was full of mostly wrapping and no filling and super squishy, like, not sure they cooked it right squishy. Hao gao (sp?) was prob the best of the bunch. The xiao long bao were decent, had some nice soup to it but doesn't even compare to Chinatown here or in Atlanta. Just a very average place and I guess it's fine if you can't make it to the plethora of others in Chinatown. But it is expensive for dim sum. $2+ per dim sum piece. Our total was just over $60. Most I've ever spent on dim sum.",0

16933,"Perfect date spot.  The low, warm lighting in the simultaneously rustic and contemporary style dining room creates a romantic atmosphere and the lack of background music (just the ambient chatter of other guests) allows you to actually hear your date while not feeling like everyone is listening to your conversation.The service is on point, as you would expect at this sort of establishment.  Honestly I don't frequent $$$$ spots too often (or ever), so was sort of intimidated w the wine list, about how many items to order, pronouncing the french food, etc. but whatev you get over it.  Our server was courteous and explained how many items to order, and wasn't imposing on our decisions.  He seemed to cater to whomever he was serving because the table next to us was super chatty and he reciprocated well. I guess just be yourself and the staff will match your personality hahaWe got the navets en guise d'escargots ($29), which was my favorite part of the meal.  The fake escargots made up of uni, mussels, and turnips in classic escargot flavor was super flavorful and well crafted.  The crepinette de volaille au foi gras et fruits ($28) was like a chicken and basil meatball w a little chunk of fatty liver in the middle-- pretty much the right amount of foie gras for someone like me who isn't all that into organ meats.  The tout le lapin ($46) is fun.  The rabbit comes in three dishes: kidney and liver pates, a soup w greens, and a honey dijon sauerkraut bake.  Try the sauerkraut w the table bread for a reuben-like filler if you're worried about being hungry afterward (surprisingly, we were not even though we usually eat big-portioned meals-- I think it was all the bread we ate).  The pigeon ""cote de provence"" ($42) is fine, tasted like chicken and came w roasted veggies and little fried, artichoke-filled raviolis.  I think next time, I'd opt to have one person get fish to switch it up.  The rabbit and pigeon tasted kind of similar to my, albeit unrefined, taste.The 2016 yves cuilleron cavanos ($55, half bottle) was such a pleasant addition to the meal.  And, of course I couldn't not have dessert.  The omelette norvegienne ($17) aka a bombed alaska had pistachio ice cream in sponge cake inside a toasty meringue outer layer that was flambed at the table.  Though I didn't love the liqueur that seeped into the cake and sort of tarnished the otherwise sweet taste of the dessert, it was still a real crowd pleaser.Overall, I'd go again to try other items on the menu.  I really appreciated their attention to detail apparent in their service and the food itself-- really set the right ambiance for our anniversary!

There's nowhere to sit down, people are yelling, you'll likely be a bit confused but the prices and quality of food is unbeatable.

The cabbage is bland and the rice is fine but that doesn't matter to me, the meat is the main draw here. There's usually a long line outside during busy hours but it goes quickly.

I recently gave in to the quintessential New York experience of grabbing a pizza slice in the heart of the city, with Joe's Pizza being my initiation immediately after touching down in NYC.

True to the New York pace, the line moved swiftly.

We dove into a trio of slices: Mozzarella, Caprese, and the standout Supreme. Hunger might accentuate taste, but Joe's truly hit the mark with incredibly cheesy, thin, and crispy slices that lived up to every food lover's dream. Even as someone not typically swept away by pizza, I was thoroughly impressed.

Beyond the food and ambience, it's the enthusiasm of the friendly staff that adds to the charm, creating an upbeat and charismatic atmosphere that's palpable from the moment you ascend to the second floor. New Craft Agave is not just a dining venue; it's a vibrant destination where good food and good vibes are in abundance.",1
3463,"Came here with a few friends for Chinese Northeastern BBQ skewers. The waitresses were very attentive, but the skewers were just OK. We ordered a bunch of different things, including lamb, beef, chicken gizzard, chicken heart, pork kidney, bun (mantou), egg plant, corn, pig feet etc. The lamb and egg plant were fine, beef was too dry, chicken gizzard and heart were both tasteless, not sure whether they were properly marinated. The pork kidney (probably a bad choice) was so smelly （stinky）and we gave up after the first bite. As the skewers were not the best, we ordered the pickled pepper flavored frogs. The flavor was good but I think they dipped the frog in too much starch before they fried it, too starchy that it covered the texture of the meat.I hope the chef can pay attention to the seasoning of the ingredients as most skewers tasted so bland.",0
1944,Fast cheap  and filling. The pizza slice was the size of two paper plates which is exactly what they served it on. Delicious and creamy just as you'd imagine. Super thiccccc slice too $6,0
10693,"I visited this restaurant during their special restaurant week and wanted to love it, but ultimately came away underwhelmed. The staff was accommodating with our tardy arrival, which was a plus. However, the food didn't quite hit the mark. It felt like the kitchen was overwhelmed by the crowd, leading to a lack of attention to detail. 

The presentation was a letdown, especially the appetizer, which was just a small, sad heap of brussel sprouts. The salad was similarly disappointing, appearing wilted and overly pre-dressed. Main courses like the butternut squash ravioli and margherita pizza were decent, but nothing to write home about. 

In essence, this spot might be good for an inexpensive glass of wine and some casual dining, but it didn't impress enough to earn my recommendation.",1
18812,"Tucked away in Harlem, this charming brunch spot was a delightful find when the usual haunts were bustling. The airy decor and abundance of natural light provide a refreshing change from the ubiquity of dimly lit eateries. Our picks from the menu were an omelette and shakshouka, both arriving posthaste. While the shakshouka was pleasing, it could benefit from a more generous portion of tomatoes, eggs, and bread. A mix-up with the bill turned into a showcase of their exceptional customer service, as we were compensated for the negligible error with complimentary mimosas. This level of attention is a rare gem in NYC dining. A return visit is definitely on the cards.",1
12897,"We visited on a weekend for brunch. The inside was surprisingly small, since I was expecting a full-on ""restaurant"" type eatery. It seems that most businesses they have are either pick up or delivery. They did have a couple of small tables, and a small counter seating by the window. They have some enticing lunch special menu at great price, and our luck would have it, they offer it for brunch too! They come with complimentary side salad, a choice of starter, and a water. The water can be upgraded to Thai Iced Tea or Soda for additional cost. We got the Thai Iced Tea (additional $2 for upgrade from water). It was really good, kind of nutty, and very sweet as expected. We had Vegetable Gyoza and Fried Tofu as starters. They were small in portion, but they are starters... Gyoza were steamed, not fried. Tofu were very firm, with a bit of kick to it from the tasty sauce.For main, we had Massaman Curry with Fried Fillet Fish, and Street Pork Noodle Soup.  Curry was coconut-y and sweet, but not too sweet. Nice amount of rice and loads of lightly fried white fish, which was very tasty! The Noodle Soup was so good! Light with almost translucent broth and noodle, not heavy at all. Earthy and comfy, very homey and flavorful. It was very satisfying, we were full with just a little over $20! The female staff was very friendly and welcoming also, we will be sure to return!",0
15311,"Love Lady G, but not impressed with Joanne Trattoria.  It's under new management, since the family sold to new ownership.  Here's the positive- the wait staff was extremely friendly, but grossly understaffed or overbooked?  Food equivalent to Olive Garden(which I Avoid) at 4x's the price.   My other reviews reflect good ratings and it's hard for me write anything negative.  The Joanne's meatballs were very good and probably the highlight of the entire meal $14 for two. The red beat arugula salad $18 was all arugula and 2 beats- nothing special. The lemon artichoke chicken $26 had store boxed spaghetti with luke warm chicken (frankly it was lower quality than Olive Garden. The tiramisu was made in-house and very good $14.  There are so many wonderful places in the city and we wish JT well, but wouldn't recommend this place or come back.",0
15794,"Title: Cozy Ambience at The Bernic, Yet Lacks Essentials

I recently visited the bar located just off the lobby at the Bernic and found it to be a charming spot with delightful mood lighting that really sets the tone for a relaxing evening. Disappointingly, when I requested an Alaskan, the bar was not stocked with chartreuse, which I consider a basic ingredient for a well-equipped bar. Nevertheless, the bartender was quite accommodating and whipped up an alternative cocktail that was unexpectedly delightful. It's worth noting, however, that during my visit, no food or snacks were offered to accompany my drink, which was a letdown. Overall, while the atmosphere was pleasant, the lack of essential ingredients and the absence of any munchies compelled me to knock off a couple of stars, leaving the bar with an overall average impression.",1
12093,"On a weekday evening, my dining experience at this esteemed NYC romantic restaurant truly lived up to its celebrated reputation. The staff welcomed us warmly with smiles that persisted throughout our visit, ensuring a delightful atmosphere. The star of the night was unquestionably the Beef Wellington, a culinary triumph along with the other gourmet dishes we savored. Years into its operation, this establishment continues to shine, rightfully earning its spot on any foodie's checklist. #dodrinkdine (Original Post 7/16/13)",1
12577,"This is many people's go to spot for coffee, breakfast and lunch who work in the area. Food is overall pretty healthy (but still tasty). They do have pastries so they're probably the least healthy thing here.My breakfast of choice is sausage egg and cheese on a wrap. I think the sausage is turkey, not pork. They don't have regular bacon, only turkey bacon (I hate turkey bacon!). The wrap looks like whole wheat. They have fresh squeezed juice and a lot of health food bottled drinks.For lunch, they have a variety of hot foods where you can mix and match with a grain, protein and 2 sides. I like the salmon, mac and cheese, and brussel sprouts. They also have soups and sandwiches. I love their matzo ball soup - nice rich flavor and full of dill. This is my go to for when I'm under the weather.Overall the employees are friendly and service is fast.",0
10092,"Title: A Satisfying Bowl of Spicy Ajisen Ramen

I recently visited a local ramen spot and tried their Spicy Ajisen Ramen - a flavorful bowl with a generous serving of meat and well-portioned noodles. The broth stole the show; creamy and robust, it was a delightful base for the dish. The pork chashu, while not meltingly tender, was satisfactory, especially considering the ample three slices provided. There was a subtle hint of Chinese seasoning, which wasn't surprising given the restaurant's background.

The meal was reasonably priced at $15 including tip and tax, reflecting good value for the quality and quantity. Service was attentive, with my water glass frequently topped off with ice, a small but appreciated touch. The atmosphere was relaxed, with plenty of seating available on a Sunday night.

In summary, the overall experience was very positive. I would certainly return and recommend this place to fellow ramen enthusiasts.",1
14578,Just amazing! I can't say enough good things about my experience here. I can't wait to go back. The entire staff from the front to the back of the house were incredibly friendly and welcoming. The decor was beautiful and seasonally decorated with lots of autumn things. I opted for the seasonal tasting menu with the wine pairing. Worth every penny.,0
11070,"Title: Cozy Comfort at The Cheese Grille

My recent visit to The Cheese Grille in the Lower East Side proved to be the epitome of fast casual dining done right. Perfect for me and my bestie, who had her little one along, we relished in the homely ambiance of this snug eatery without the fuss of a traditional sit-down restaurant.

Their menu served as an unexpected muse for my kitchen endeavors – I left eager to experiment with a triple cheese blend for my homemade grilled cheese, inspired by their sumptuous selection. The tomato soup, a divine concoction, was as fresh as it gets and a perfect companion to our cheesy delights.

A note to families, though – the absence of child-sized portions was a slight letdown. Comfort food classics like grilled cheese and mac & cheese scream kid-friendly, yet there were no small servings catered to little appetites.

Despite this, The Cheese Grille still shines with a solid 4-star experience. It's a dependable spot for those quick, tasty bites, and I wouldn't hesitate to return when I'm back in the neighborhood.",1
19012,"Upon first glance, this unassuming pizza joint appeared to be just another hole-in-the-wall establishment, but it proved to be a delightful surprise. The buffalo chicken pizza tantalized my taste buds with its seriously delicious flavors, and even the basic pepperoni and the pepperoni/jalapeno pizzas did not disappoint. Adding to the pleasure was the discovery that the prices were marginally lower than what I've encountered at other pizzerias. This no-frills spot is serving up some genuinely scrumptious slices that shouldn't be overlooked.",1
3617,"We had a delightful experience at the café, where the standout dish was the Mille-Feuille – it transported us straight to the heart of Paris with its authenticity and exquisite taste. The burger was another highlight, offering a straightforward yet exceptional flavor that exceeded our expectations. Highly recommend for a taste of Parisian charm and a reliable, excellent burger.",1
19869,"Title: Nostalgia Can Only Take You So Far

If you're hankering for that classic diner ambiance, this spot might scratch that itch, but don't expect the culinary experience to match up. During my hunt for a decent brunch, I decided to finally give this place a shot and ordered the Lexington special, unfortunately, served with cold roast beef that didn't justify its $18.50 price tag. For a slightly bigger spend, a deli like Pastrami Queen could offer a superior sandwich.

In the beverage department, the $9.25 milkshake failed to impress, leaving me longing for the inventive shakes at Mel's Burger Bar. My friend's banana pancakes, however, did hit the mark, suggesting breakfast items may be the safer bet here. The coffee, meanwhile, received a thumbs down, dulling the shine of the overall morning fare.

The charm of history and the vintage vibe come at a premium here, with prices that don't quite align with the quality. While it's a place worth checking out once for the experience, the general consensus of overpriced and average offerings holds true. Also, a heads up that while they welcome credit cards, tipping in cash is a must – a detail best clarified upfront in today's increasingly cashless society.",1
10974,"Title: A Delightful Lunch Experience with Thoughtful Service

I had the pleasure of dining here for lunch with a friend and it was a truly satisfying experience. The attention to my seafood allergy right from the start set a positive tone, as the host communicated this crucial detail to our server without prompt.

The meal began with a delightful bread basket served with what I believe was an orange marmalade, elevating the simple pleasure of fresh bread. The butternut squash soup was a standout, boasting a perfect consistency and the added zest of flavorful sprouts.

The main course of tender short ribs was cooked to perfection, accompanied by broccoli that managed to win over even a self-proclaimed non-enthusiast like myself. The option for unlimited mimosas proved to be economical and indulgent, adding a festive flair to our lunch.

Although we experienced minor delays in server attention at times, the overall service was commendable. This restaurant delivered on all fronts, warranting a hearty 4.5 stars for an undoubtedly pleasing dining experience.",1
21097,"Interior-typical hk cafe vibe, a lot of seating areaService-they spoke mandarin and Cantonese. Decent service but CASH ONLY. Had to run to an ATM nearby.Taste-GREAT!! Very authentic hk cafe taste. I recommend the curry with beef tendon plate, so tender and flavorful. The pineapple bun with butter was also delicious, the perfect appetizer to start off with. Most importantly, super affordable, the meal comes out to be about $11 per person.",0
16893,"Title: A Delighted Sushi Fix at Tenzan

After an exhaustive day of hitting the books, my sushi cravings led me to explore UberEats, where Tenzan caught my eye. Opting for the deluxe meal (peek at my uploaded photo for the spread), I was met with a delightful culinary experience.

The sushi was exceptional, clearly prepared fresh and with care. A highlight was the salmon, perfectly cooked and nestled on a bed of crisp veggies. The accompanying egg rolls were a pleasant surprise, tasty and devoid of the usual discomfort they tend to bring.

Rounding out the meal, the miso soup and rice were fitting sides, leaving me thoroughly content. Portion-wise, the meal was generous enough to serve two, but I savored it over two sittings.

Tenzan has earned its spot as my go-to for future sushi cravings. A genuinely great discovery!",1
20679,"The midtown Mala Project is just as pitch-perfect as its East Village predecessor, though it trades the original's low-lit, exposed brick aesthetic for a sleeker, more corporate vibe. It's hard for me to imagine knocking back beers here in the same way I normally would downtown; this feels more like a lunch spot, albeit a hip one.Nonetheless, the signature dry pot, spicy stir fry made to your liking, is consistently good. I'm happy with 3-4 ingredients, though my appetite on the smaller side. You can't go wrong with the ingredients, but I recommend fish fillet, wood ear mushroom, and chicken heart. Mild or medium is a good place to start; spicy is truly spicy. Addictive flavor, with great numbing peppercorns and fresh cilantro. Stick with white rice; the special purple rice isn't worth the upcharge.Service is good. Ambiance is nice. They do brisk business at lunch but I came around noon and didn't have to wait for a table for two. There's a full bar, including house cocktails.An accessible introduction to Sichuan cuisine and a worthy addition to the Midtown scene.",0
11674,"So I've been in the flat iron district for awhile now and everyone has been telling me that I have to try these tacos! I decided it was timd to seek out Chelsea market and grab a bite. The line was unusually long so, with a line that long.. You know there is no mistake. I found myself waiting 30 min to get to the front of this line. There was all kinds of cool stuff to look at and all kinds of amazing colors while I waited. When we got to the front, we were starving! I was pleasantly surprised to see that they had hortchacha! I got that and some chicken and beef tacos and a old fashioned bottle of coke to drink. We could see the guys cooking our tacos in front of us and the setup was extremely cool. Their grill was the best! After that, we went to go find a seat! There was no seating available in the area of the actual dining location so we went to eat our amazing tacos by the waterfall! Best experience ever. The tacos were the kind of tacos that make your taste buds dance for joy! I'm excited to have tried this place!

I recently had the pleasure of dining at this charming little restaurant where the flavors truly stole the show. The standout for me was the chicken udon noodles accompanied by three tantalizing sauces, each adding a unique depth to the dish. Additionally, the Thai ice was a refreshing companion to the meal. Don't let the size of the place deter you; the limited seating is a small compromise for the quality of food served. I'm already looking forward to my next visit to explore more of their menu. Highly recommended for the taste adventure!",1
10992,"Wow what a gem this place is! This is America's first fine dining restaurant founded in 1837.  I started off with a glass of Riesling which was amazing as well as the Cesar salad. The porterhouse steak is beyond. Half ribeye half filet minion and you must order a side of foie gras butter for the steak!!!! I also tried the lamb chop which was delightful, so tender and juicy! The fries were also cooked in a nice oil and the king crab Mac n cheese was the best side on the menu. Do not miss out on this amazing place that's a historical landmark for the financial district!",0
2398,"Title: A Slice of New York Perfection at Joe's Pizza

During a leisurely Wednesday afternoon in Greenwich Village, I decided to give in to my cravings at Joe's Pizza, a spot that's often mentioned in the debate for the best pizza in New York. The visit did not disappoint. Joe's Pizza delivers on the promise of a quintessential New York slice: a crust with impeccable consistency, a sauce that sings with flavor, and just the right amount of cheese. While the standard slice stood out, the Fresh Mozz and Sicilian slices were equally satisfying.

Portion size was spot on for a fulfilling pizza experience, and the prices were reasonable: $3.00 for a standard slice and $3.50 for either Sicilian or Fresh Mozz. The ambiance at the original Greenwich Village location is exactly what you'd expect from a storied pizzeria—pictures of celebrity patrons adorn the walls, and the inevitable line out the door speaks to Joe's enduring appeal.

The shop itself is petite and while it offers a few stools, they are scarcely enough for the bustling crowd. Nonetheless, the staff is adept, keeping the line moving quickly, so you're never waiting too long. Nearby park benches offer a perfect spot to enjoy your slice if seating inside is scarce.

Parking in the area can be a bit of a hunt, but it's not impossible to find street parking. Overall, Joe's Pizza stands out not just for the quality of its pizza, but for the entire experience it offers, despite the spatial limitations. A must-visit for anyone seeking an authentic slice of New York.",1
13835,"Bottomless boozy brunch!! What else could a girl ask for??! Great service even though was super busy. We came with a VERY LARGE group, but they were able to keep our glasses filled and bring our food out while it was still hot.

19443,"AMAZING Zapote milkshake!! I've had a hard time finding Zapote in Louisiana so I was super excited when I was walking by and saw on the sign outside that they had a Zapote smoothie. I called it a milkshake earlier because I got mine with milk (extra $1) because I think it tastes better that way. If you like Zapote this is the place to get a Zapote smoothie. The Tamarind, Papaya and Passionfruit smoothies kind of caught my attention too but I've had those recently. Unfortunately, I didn't get to taste any of their food but the Mofongo looked delicious! I'll definitely be coming back next time I'm in town.",0
19007,"Hmm, what can I say about Cho Dang Gol that hasn't been said 45,873 times already... High quality Korean food at fairly reasonable prices. This was probably my 7th visit and I've always had a great meal. Kimchi Biji was SUPERB. In fact, it was so good that we got an extra order for take-out. And the plan is to try to replicate it at home. However, I doubt we'll be able to come close, given the high quality ingredients. Definitely check this place out if you haven't. And definitely try the Kimchi Biji! You won't be disappointed. Also, it looks like they have pretty good lunch specials, but obviously most ppl won't be able to take advantage. Extremely envious for those that can!",0
3569,"Loved the place! We went for a dinner here on Friday night, the place was packed, but we were sorted right away, cause we decided not to wait for a table, but took bar-like eating tables. We ordered some drinks which were very nice and came out fast. Then we got pickled plate - highly recommend this if you like pickeled  vegetables, and they have salmon tartar as a special - it was ok, not really impressed, cause the dish was more like ceviche. For the main course my husband had something from there specials of the day, I think it was something if beef with potatoes and pickeled cabbage, he said it was really good, and I could appropriate the portion size. For myself I chose Foie gras, nice a tender, like a butter, highly recommend. We will jeep in mind this place if we are around, definitely worth coming back",0
18512,"Upon revisiting a long-time favorite, my recent experience at this establishment left me with mixed feelings. Having ordered pork and cabbage fried dumplings, I was met with an unexpected mix of both fried and boiled dumplings in my takeout.

Despite the slip-up, there remains a glimmer of the quality that has kept me coming back over the years.",1
19649,"I came for dinner during restaurant week. The portions were definitely sized down to meet the $42 price point, but the food was excellent! Our server Jose was kind, helpful, and funny! Incredibly attentive and very knowledgeable of the menu. When the appetizers came out, I'm not going to lie, I was really disappointed with the portion size, but by the end of the meal I was content (not stuffed. I could have eaten a second dessert or a $3 taco, but I exercised self-restraint). I had the snow crab sunomono and my friend had the tuna tartare. Next time I'm going straight for the tartare, it was incredible! Mains, I had the sea bass and he had the skirt steak. I would get either entree again, they were both juicy, perfectly seasoned, and came with a side of rice. I was able to finish every grain of my rice but the skirt steak was a larger portion and my friend didn't finish his rice. Dessert we both got the matcha pana cotta. This is the only dessert I ever need again!",0
1120,"Upon first glance, I had moderate expectations for this eatery, but my visit was marred by a series of unfortunate events. The service was slow to start, and while the waitress eventually arrived to take our order, she remained preoccupied with other patrons. Our inquiries about menu items were met with an unsettling revelation that their salmon was canned, which already put a damper on the experience.

Compounding the disappointment, a member of our party, who speaks with a heavy accent, was mockingly corrected by the waitress when pronouncing ""salmon."" This, understandably, was off-putting. The unpleasantness peaked when the staff engaged in a verbal altercation on the floor, subjecting customers to their heated exchange.

Attempting to steer clear of further issues, we ordered simple, diner-style fare, only to observe a string of order mix-ups around us. Overall, the visit was a letdown, with the restaurant's performance landing squarely in the realm of mediocrity. One can hope that our experience was an outlier, but it's hard to recommend a place after such a lackluster visit.",1
1003,"Upon entering the establishment, I immediately noticed the layout spanning two levels. The upstairs area was notably brighter, a stark contrast to the basement's low ceilings and dim lighting. Televisions were strategically placed throughout, creating a sports-centric ambiance.

While the venue boasted an abundance of seating options, including both regular and high-top tables spread across both floors, the food, unfortunately, did not live up to the spacious setting. As someone who appreciates good bar fare, I found the offerings here lackluster. The tater tots, while unusually large, were not enough to redeem the overall culinary experience.

For those looking to catch a game with friends, the ample space does lend itself well to accommodating large groups. However, for an overall dining and sports-viewing experience, there are better sports bars available that could more effectively satisfy both your viewing pleasure and taste buds.",1

Expecting to grab something quick from the ""get up and go"" section—which, to note, is only available Monday through Friday—I opted instead for a sit-down meal. The classic Eggs Benedict I ordered did not disappoint. A testament to their culinary prowess, Sugar Hill served up a delicate yet flavorful dish with eggs poached to perfection and a sturdy, slightly toasted muffin as the foundation. Paired with a great cappuccino and a fresh side salad, this brunch spot nails a healthier yet indulgent breakfast experience. Sugar Hill demonstrates a finesse with brunch staples that's well worth a visit.",1
10226,"As an aficionado of culinary television, the discovery of an Iron Chef Masaharu Morimoto-run restaurant near my workplace was a thrilling find. Having often found ramen to be uninspiring, the presence of a coconut curry ramen on the menu captivated my taste buds with its likeness to my beloved Thai curries, paired with the comfort of noodles. While the broth leaned on the richer side, a splash of vinegar brought it to perfection. The dish featured a duo of pork, with both sliced belly and ground portions enhancing the flavors beautifully.

The sticky ribs appetizer was another standout, with pork so tender it nearly parted with the bone at the gentlest touch, dressed in a glaze so delectable it threatened to outshine the plate itself.

Service matched the exemplary fare – from the warm welcome to the attentive waitstaff. Moreover, the value was notable, offering a high-caliber dining experience without a prohibitive price tag.

An intriguing twist: the menu boasts exclusive items available only on particular days or in limited quantities, a tempting reason for a repeat visit.

Enthusiasm for this establishment is unmistakable. Whether you're a ramen enthusiast or skeptic, this restaurant promises to surprise and delight. A deserved five-star rating for an establishment that excels in every category. I eagerly anticipate my next visit, with hopes of delving into those special menu offerings.",1

My latest dining adventure led me to discover my new favorite steakhouse. We visited for a weeknight dinner at 9 pm, greeted by a uniquely styled steakhouse that eschewed the traditional dark wood decor for something more intriguing.

Service was top-notch; the waitstaff was attentive and personable. However, I could have done without the full-blast lighting during our meal. The cocktail offerings were merely passable, but the food truly shone. My boyfriend devoured his perfectly cooked filet mignon alongside a creamy purée of potatoes. I savored a succulent NY strip and perfectly seasoned roasted cauliflower, deliberately reserving half for a delicious next-day lunch.

Dessert was the cherry on top, with homemade Twix ice cream and a delightful banana ice cream, both leaving us thoroughly content. Despite the minor hiccup with the lighting, this steakhouse has earned its place at the top of my list. Mmmmm, indeed!",1

My family and I dropped by this upscale, family-friendly eatery for some post-wedding lunchtime dim sum. The ambiance catered well to large groups, though the popular spot was quite packed, with tables positioned a bit too snugly for comfort.

The dim sum was satisfying – good without being exceptional. We encountered an assertive service from the dim sum attendants, who seemed overly eager to have us try more dishes, leading to some confusion about what we were actually charged for. I experienced a minor snag when one of my ordered items failed to materialize, and it was unclear if the oversight was due to a miscommunication or simply missed.

In all, this restaurant is a solid choice for a group seeking a communal dining experience, albeit with a few areas that could use a touch of refinement.",1

I have heard people raving about it. So I had to check it out my self. Walked in and was greeted by the host. Had the chance to pick the table to our preference, not many restaurants do that. We browsed through the menu , and couldn't decide. Came along the Owner himself to check on us , as he was making his rounds. Decided to ask him for some popular dishes in the restaurant. He was super tentative, and we went on his guidance. We tried out the Pani Puri Shot which is definitely a must. Waited had brought some complementary snacks to munch on till our food came out . For Appetizers we ordered the Galouti Kebab , it's minced mutton meat . It's a dish from my hometown in India (Lucknow ), so I had to try it . They actually nailed it , IT WAS DELICIOUS. Brought back some childhood memories . For main dish , he suggested we try their new dish Dum Biryani. It wasn't even on the menu , so literally was a surprise . It came out in a deep bowl with Naan Covering it . You actually have to cut out the Naan to get to it. It was also really good , just a bit spicy for my taste buds . We also had the most famous Indian dish , Butter Chicken. Everyone knows Butter Chicken. It was paired with Garlic Naan and white rice . It's a must !! when you go to Indian restaurant, you have to get one of the dishes as butter chicken . Ended it with some great Dessert!!

Tip: the spicy broth is literally the pig bone broth with spicy oil so maybe order the pig bone and mix your own concoction from their sauce station. The sauce station wIll not disappoint you. The place is cleaner than other hotpot places I have been too. ServicE is prompt. Definitely try the seafood pancake. The beef and lamb are frozen FYI. The fish fIIllets and fishh tofu were my favorite. Everything else was pretty standard. The broth was average; I have definitely had better ones. They have large tables and great for groups I can tell. We could not finish all of the food and wasted a little but tHey did not charge us. Impressed and will be back!,0

Review:

During a friend's inaugural NYC visit, I played local guide and included Refinery Rooftop in our rooftop hopping adventure. Our Saturday post-lunch arrival greeted us with immediate seating, a blessing in the sweltering heat, with the indoor space offering a much-appreciated air-conditioned respite, yet maintaining an airy feel close to the open-air section.

The ambiance and decor struck a delightful note, embodying urban chic with a comfortable twist. I indulged in a Frose, which while slightly lacking in strength, did not disappoint in flavor. A side of fries served as our snack, proving delectably executed, and whetting my appetite for a future visit where a dive into their full entree offerings is a must—despite NYC's typical premium pricing.

The real showstopper was the view. Just steps from our table, the grandeur of the Empire State Building unfolded in a perfect backdrop for Instagram-worthy snapshots. Service remained on point throughout, attentive without being intrusive, and truly rounding out the refined experience.

Refinery Rooftop is certainly on my list for a return visit, ideally to savor their full culinary prowess with the cityscape as my dining companion.",1
14312,"This is a very convenient spot for students to get their quick fix of sushi cravings. Decent food quality and very reasonable price, great service by the cashier!!I came in around 1PM on a Wednesday and this place was poppin. Seating gets limited but most people just grab and go. The portion of the scoops for fish is pretty small, but again, considering that the price is relatively low for poke bowls. Plus you can add as much toppings as you want!! They are very generous with the sauce, so if you don't like it too saucy make sure you let them know. The cashier today was extremely friendly and served everyone with a warm smile :) really hope this place sticks around forever and will come back more often!",0
213,"This is a tiny, cozy place with cute decor and a friendly vibe. It was relatively quiet on a Sunday afternoon so we were able to sit at a four top by the window. We were planning to have bowls or something but were pleased to see a brunch menu with a few varieties of vegan pancakes!!  They have blueberry, banana pecan, chocolate chip, buckwheat and multigrain. A stack is $11 or you can get a stack with  two sides for $16. I went for chocolate chip with soy bacon and potato hash. The bacon seemed almost like a cracker but it had really nice bacon flavor. The pancakes were delicious and I'm so happy to have found a solid vegan pancake restaurant!  Our server was very nice and friendly too.  Great experience all around!!",0
19259,We came here with a group of friends to grab a few mid day beer! The bar/restaurant was cutely decorated and had a good beer menu. We all sat in the bar area. If you have a larger group it's probably not the best spot as we didn't really have a area to stand around without being in everyone's way but it was still fun! Highly recommend if your looking for a small local area to hang out! They had outdoor seating as well!,0
16645,"Title: Hoped for More at This Gastropub

Stepping into this charmingly decorated gastropub near the Museum of the City of New York, I carried high hopes fueled by enthusiastic Yelp reviews. Alas, my experience fell short of expectations.

I ordered the Huevos Rancheros, anticipating a dish as vibrant as ones I've savored before. Though the eggs were perfectly cooked, the sauce missed the mark, presenting a lackluster flavor profile without even a whisper of the heat I craved.

The dining scene at my table varied. The burger, which one would expect to shine in a gastropub setting, was deemed just ""OK"" by a friend. On a brighter note, the classic buttermilk pancakes received a thumbs up, while the Eggs Benedict slotted in as perfectly average.

Service was a tale of two halves: attentive at first, but losing steam as the brunch crowd swelled—a forgivable yet noticeable dip.

In essence, this spot's convenience and aesthetic appeal deserve accolades. However, I left yearning for the culinary delight that sadly didn't grace the table this time around. Fellow food aficionados, this venture may not live up to the hype—at least based on my latest brunch visit.",1
2700,"Title: A Little Slice of Texas BBQ Heaven in NoMad

My visit to this NoMad eatery was a delightful foray into traditional Texas BBQ, and it didn't disappoint. Stepping into what seemed like a transported Texas saloon, the ambiance perfectly set the stage for the feast that awaited.

The family-style service in the market at the back was friendly and efficient. Patrons pick their proteins and sides—my personal recommendation is the smoked brisket, which was nothing short of perfection.

The unique system of marking a card with your selections and settling the bill post-meal was a convenient touch. And if you're looking to unwind, their bar offers a generous happy hour from 5 pm, where the chili Mac and cheese is a standout choice.

The staff's warm and attentive manner adds to the relaxed vibe, making it ideal for group dining. The weekends up the ante with live music, creating a truly vivacious atmosphere. Don't forget to indulge in a traditional dessert to round off the experience.

In short, for a taste of Texas in the heart of Manhattan, this BBQ joint is a must-visit. Don't walk—scoot on over!",1
12020,"Tucked away in the heart of Central Park, this gem of a restaurant offers an enchanting dining experience amidst nature's beauty. While prices lean toward the higher end, the quality of the meal shines through, justifying the expense. Patrons should note, however, that the popularity of the spot can lead to longer waiting times. Plan accordingly to savor both the food and the setting without rush.",1
15360,"If you're on the hunt for authentic Mexican cuisine in New York, Los Mariscos is a jackpot. As a Southern California native, I know my Mexican food, and let me tell you, this place is the real deal. Forget about those chain restaurants that miss the mark—Los Mariscos is where it's at. Their especial ceviche paired with a michelada is a combination that I crave even when I'm back in California. It's a little slice of home, a rare find that gets a solid 10/10 from this particular foodie. Trust me, you'll want to come back for more.",1
198,"During a lunch break, I visited this spot for a poké bowl and chose one of the signature options, customizing it at the kiosk. Service was swift, but the meal didn't hit the mark. The mango chunks were hard and bitter, a telltale sign they were unripe. Sweet, syrupy Mandarin oranges overwhelmed the dish, and the spicy tuna ball was a letdown—better to choose whole slices of fish. However, the kale noodles were a pleasant surprise, and the regular tuna and edamame met expectations. Despite this, the overall experience fell flat, and I'm inclined to say I won't be returning.",1
12857,"My dining experience at this restaurant was exceptional. The guacamole was particularly outstanding, and the mojito I ordered proved to be awesome indeed. We indulged in a ceviche sampler, and each bite was delicious - the ones resembling baby tacos and those containing tuna were highlights, and should not be missed. Accompanied by another couple, we ordered a variety of dishes, though it's hard to keep track of all the delightful flavors we encountered. The service matched the quality of the food, ensuring a memorable evening. And a special recommendation goes to the cheese fondue with mushrooms - an absolute must-try. Overall, this meal was thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish.",1
2990,"I recently dined at this charming little spot that caught my eye with its tidy surroundings. The staff greeted us warmly and demonstrated their knowledge by detailing the daily special, which was much appreciated. My dining companion and I decided to try the chicken parmigiana and the salmon. In summary, our visit was pleasant, and I'd rate the overall experience a solid 7 out of 10.",1
14057,"Wow! This place gets packed! Even on a monday night the place was full. It is a pretty small place good for more or less 20-25 people. However, when we arrived, the wait was surprisingly just 5 minutes for 5 people. Nice! We got lucky.Our group tried their dumplings which tasted fresh and not those pre-packed, refrigerated ones. Maybe i'd give it 3.9/5 but i do get picky with dumplings.Anyway, the staff was nice and pleasant. And the lady who served us spoke in Japanese which made the experience feel even more ""authentic"". Im just weird like that.So when our ramen bowls were served, it looked pretty delicious. It was also of good portion, nicely presented and had a good hearty broth. I had replaced thin noodles for wavy noodles for my minca bowl and i thought the noodles were done perfectly. Good taste and had a good chew.I'd recommend this place for friends preferably for a smaller group though. But be prepared to circle around before you can find a good parking spot. But rest assured, you'll get to enjoy a nice bowl of ramen after.",0
18474,"Came here one night after work with old colleagues for drinks and dinner.  The staff was very friendly and accommodating.  I ordered the crab cakes (dinner portion) for my meal and was very happy with everything about it!   This seems to be a popular hang out for the people that I was with, I hope to come back a lot more often!   Crowd was mixed, mostly suits after work.  I do not believe they have happy hour specials, but I believe most of the more expensive steakhouses do not anyway.",0
16254,"I recently visited this restaurant for brunch and was impressed by the swift and efficient service provided. The menu boasted a vast array of choices, ranging from sweet breakfast items like waffles, pancakes, and French toast to hearty lunch options like sandwiches, burgers, and even seafood and meat dishes. Our meals were served promptly, and the wait staff performed their job adequately.

That said, I found the pricing to be somewhat steep relative to the quality of the food. While portions were generous, in line with the typical diner experience, the quality didn't quite live up to the cost. Overall, this place is suitable for those looking for a quick brunch stop with ample servings, though it may not satisfy those seeking a meal that is both wallet-friendly and top-notch in taste.",1
11581,"I really liked this place, its impressive and a nice place to bring someone for a special dinner/date. I'm a vegetarian, but the 3 others I was with all had steaks. I really enjoyed my salad and the dessert was outstanding. Apparently they fly in the Baklava daily from Turkey. I would go back just for that! Everyone said they really enjoyed their food and it was delicious. My reason for a 4 star vs 5 star is that we were all annoyed by the sommelier as he was super pushy and just wanted us to buy the ultra expensive bottles of wine. But other than that everything was great! @traveleen_gurl",0
11354,"Title: Mixed Feelings at by CHLOE - Cute but Hit and Miss

I stumbled upon by CHLOE while scouring Yelp for vegan eateries in NYC. The place buzzed with popularity among the vegan crowd when my friend and I visited on a Thursday afternoon. The charming interior and ample seating set a welcoming scene, complemented by the convenience of ordering through a personable front counter or a self-service kiosk.

I opted for the shiitake bacon-topped mac and cheese and the pesto meatball sandwich, while my friend chose the classic burger. Service was swift with a sub-15-minute wait. Presentation-wise, the tray service was a playful nod to a vegan cafeteria.

Although my pesto meatball sandwich had potential, the burnt bread was a letdown, making it tough to enjoy fully. The mac and cheese fared better, with the shiitake bacon standing out, though a pinch more flavor wouldn't have gone amiss. My companion's experience was less than stellar; her burger didn't hit the mark, deemed bland and left mostly untouched.

Hoping our encounter was an anomaly rather than the norm, I left with mixed emotions. by CHLOE has charm and speed, but consistency seems to be its Achilles' heel.",1
12836,"Don't do it. Don't come here. Run away as fast as you can. The food is not good, the service is slow and the food took forever. I will not be coming back nor soliciting anyone to dine here. This is not the place to be and this is New York. Go anywhere elSe on the entire planet and Mars if you have to, to dine. Warning don't come here!!!",0
16879,"Upon the recommendation of locals, I decided to brave the daunting line at this renowned pizzeria, even after an initial attempt had me retreating to nearby shops in hopes of a shorter queue to no avail. The restaurant's modest interior space made seating a coveted commodity, but I learned too late that pre-ordering could have expedited my experience.

Ordering was straightforward—I chose pepperoni and Sicilian slices—though the payment process hit a snag due to a shift change, leaving me momentarily ignored and beverage-less. However, the staff redeemed themselves with their courteous service when I sought a refill.

The pizza lived up to its hype, flavorful and satisfying, especially considering the value; at $14 for three hearty slices and a soda, it was a filling meal. Despite not finishing the robust Sicilian slice and crusts, the quality of the food made the visit worthwhile.

Service hiccup aside, the place delivers on its promise of delicious pizza at a fair price. A tip for future patrons: call ahead to dodge the wait and secure a smoother experience. Despite the cramped dining area, which can lead to a congested atmosphere, the pizza alone is a magnet for anyone in search of an authentic, tasty bite.",1
14529,"Title: A Delightful Dining Discovery

I recently dined at this gem of a restaurant and was pleasantly surprised by the value and quality. The cuisine was scrumptious from the hot antipasti appetizer, boasting four diverse selections, to the main course where the veal and eggplant entrée was a standout. Not only was the food delectable, but the portions were also generous, ensuring you won't leave hungry.

My server deserves special mention for their kindness and helpfulness, offering menu insights and personal recommendations that did not disappoint. The kitchen's efficiency was impressive as our meals arrived swiftly.

I must note, the dishes were rich, perhaps indulgent in butter, which added to the overall flavor. Also, the clean facilities were a reassuring touch to the overall experience.

For those seeking an enjoyable meal that exceeds expectations without breaking the bank, I wholeheartedly recommend this establishment.",1
11091,"Dining at Zauo presented an intriguing concept – catching your own dinner – but the execution left something to be desired. The novelty of fishing for our meal was the initial draw, and on arrival, the variety of fish and preparation options (fried, grilled, raw) seemed promising. Our party of six felt like the maximum before chaos ensued, as the actual fishing experience fell short of expectations. The absence of bait turned a fun activity into a prolonged, frustrating wait, compounded by a crowded fishing area.

After resorting to staff assistance to finally net a fish, we settled down to an array of dishes: fried flounder tempura, soy and salted grilled striped bass, tako wasabi, karaage, and a unique rainbow trout served with hot broth for dipping. Unfortunately, the policy against serving the freshly-caught fish completely raw curtailed our sushi plans. The flounder was enjoyable, yet the bass and touted karaage didn't impress.

The restaurant's large space struggled to accommodate the throngs of aspiring fishers, further detracting from the dining experience. Moreover, the fact that I didn't catch my own fish diminished the anticipated thrill. Overall, while the concept has potential, the crowded setting and the cumbersome fishing process overshadowed the enjoyment. I'm left with a preference for a traditional restaurant experience or genuine riverside fishing, and I’m hesitant to revisit Zauo.",1
20793,"I was actually very impressed. I came here for Mother's Day they have a prefix menu. Price was beyond reasonable. The food was amazing. The prefix included a complimentary drink of wine or Prosecco. I went with the Prosecco and it was yummy and bubbly. For appetizer I got to try the lobster soup, ceviche and the bacalao croquets all very yummy. The server was very cool he even gave us complimentary roses. My mom and sister enjoyed a nice Malbec glass. For entrees we went with the  NY steak my mom got the pasta sirena and my sister got the red snapper. Everyone's food was soo good and flavorful. Everything was cook well and delicious. The sever told us about their brunch so I definitely will be back with the 2 hours unlimited brunch drinks. To end the night we got dessert we decided with the molten cake and the churros and it was yummy the cake was very rich and chocolatelyy!! Very impressed and great service",0
1167,"After a lively night of bar-hopping, my companions and I stumbled upon Sojourn in the Upper East Side - a hidden gem devoid of the typical weekend night crowds. Its emptiness, contrary to expectations, worked in our favor, offering us the luxury of choice seating in their dining room.

Despite not being the epicenter of UES nightlife, Sojourn presented a varied menu that catered to our diverse tastes. The ambiance struck a comfortable balance, facilitating conversation, although at times we found ourselves competing with the boisterous volume of the music.

Service was commendable, the staff attentive without being overbearing, and the decor exuded a warm welcome. While the overall experience wasn't out of the ordinary, Sojourn shone with its delectable fries and proved to be a reliable spot to wind down with friends, especially when nearby kitchen doors shut for the night or when other venues were bursting at the seams. All in all, Sojourn is a solid choice for late-night eats in the UES.",1
12460,There is something about the sauce that makes this pizza very alluring not really sure why but it is very good.  The crust is neither too  thick or thin and the grandma slide is the best.  It's worth the wait in a very nondescript location near Penn Station.  The key is to have your order ready quickly because  the line moves New York fast.,0
2935,"Title: A Slice of Heaven

I recently had the pleasure of dining at a pizzeria that left a memorable impression. Among a plethora of mouth-watering choices, I finally settled on a classic Margherita and an adventurous Potato and Blue Cheese pizza. Decision making was a challenge, given the extensive menu.

The Margherita won me over with its zesty sauce and harmonious flavors, though the Potato and Blue Cheese was a commendable choice for those who favor a sauceless base. The crust on both pies was exceptional—crisp with a depth of flavor that only elevated the overall experience.

While the spot is perfect for a quick takeaway, be mindful that seating is sparse for those looking to enjoy their slices within its walls. Nonetheless, for anyone in search of top-tier pizza with a delightful variety, this is the place to be.",1
20869,"Honestly, I like this place for the novelty of the sizzling hot stone rock they put into your ramen (and the instagram photo that goes with it) rather than the actual quality of the ramen.We ordered the tonkotsu ramen and the tsukemen. The ramen was pretty average itself, with a mostly fatty flavor, but not much else beyond that. A little garlic on the table added a little bit more of a kick, but it was still just plain creaminess with nothing to break it.The noodles themselves were pretty good and the pork was nice as well, but since the broth takes such a centerpiece of the ramen, having such a plain one kind of broke away all the other nice parts of it.The novelty happens when you're part way through your ramen and it has cooled down. You can request a hot stone rock to be put into your ramen to heat it up again. That being said, it doesn't work as well as it sounds. The area directly around the rock gets a little bit warmer, but the other parts remain pretty cool overall, and the rock doesn't sizzle for all that long.",0
16112,"After spotting a Facebook video featuring Lions Detroit Style Pizza, my husband and I decided to check it out one Saturday afternoon around 3-4 pm. The place is quite small, offering no seating but three standing tables, so it's not the spot for a leisurely sit-down meal.

We sampled two varieties of their pizza—my husband went for the classic, while I tried a pizza adorned with pepperoni and spicy peppers (the name of which escapes me). They also had a ""special of the day"" pizza for those looking to try something different. You have the option to go for a half or whole pan; we opted for half each and found ourselves quite full, though we did have a snack before our visit.

We rated the pizza a solid 7/10. The noticeable characteristics included a sparing use of cheese and a thickness similar to—but not as overwhelming as—Chicago-style pizza. Each slice was from a corner, delivering that coveted crispy edge. Personally, I prefer this Detroit style over the heavier Chicago variety. If I found myself hungry in the area with a craving for pizza, Lions Detroit Style Pizza would be a consideration for a return visit.",1
17596,"Title: A Pulsd Deal to Remember

My recent dining experience, thanks to a fantastic pulsd deal, turned out to be the best I've taken advantage of so far. The guacamole my friend and I shared was a flavorful start, brimming with fresh veggies. The drink menu didn’t disappoint either; the Hibiscus Margarita stood out – it was the perfect balance of sweet, without being overwhelming.

For the main course, the chicken and steak fajita was a protein-packed delight, served piping hot and accompanied by an abundant mix of vegetables. The meal concluded on a high note with churros that were fried to perfection, their crispy texture complemented by a divine chocolate sauce. This restaurant truly ticked all the boxes for a memorable dining experience.",1

3035,"The name makes me think of kitchen appliances since I'm from the Bay Area, and Friedman's is the name of a home improvement chain around these parts. This Friedmans doesn't have a thing to do with DIY projects, but it has everything to do with the Art Deco hotel next door, the Edison, as it carries over the lobby's pre-mid-century period decor. I came upon it as I was looking for a place to have lunch close to the office at Sixth Avenue and 45th. It was damn cold, so it better be close, and even though it meant hazardously crossing the mob mentality at Times Square, it was close.Luckily, few of the mobs made it to Friedmans at the lunch hour as it was covered in construction scaffolding on the outside. Inside it looked classically appointed like a Fred-and-Ginger movie musical set, though they would have effortlessly danced the Continental on their way out once they took a look at the Times Square prices. Even as I focused my eyeballs on the menu's salad section, I grimaced a bit at the $20 price tag on the Sesame Salmon Salad. I bit though and received quite a hearty plateful of ingredients - kale, barley, pickled and shredded beets and carrots, avocado, edamame, and sprouts.Of course the topper consisted of the chunks of salmon which appeared to be marinated in an unnecessary soy sauce (photo: bit.ly/2EweeUW). Now here was a case of too much of a semi-good thing. Thinking the salad would be somewhat lighter, I ordered the $8 side of Roasted Cauliflower which came sprinkled with walnuts and drenched in a sherry reduction (photo: bit.ly/2NsUgx6). Again, why? The sherry added an odd sweetness to the cauliflower that did nothing to enhance the flavor.

16647,"If you're craving authentic ramen, Ichiran is a must-visit. Drawing on my delightful experiences with Ichiran in Tokyo, I found the shorter lines in the U.S. a pleasant surprise. Their unique dining concept offers both privacy and convenience, with individual stalls and a service system that respects your space.

I indulged in their recommended set priced at $24, a notch above the cost in Japan but still a worthy splurge for arguably some of the best ramen stateside. The personalization options are fantastic - from noodle firmness to the spice level, your bowl is truly your own creation. The only hiccup was the soft-boiled egg, which had a clingy shell that made peeling a tad challenging.

The consistency between Ichiran's locations from Tokyo to NYC is impressive, and their current kae-dama promotion is a generous touch. Notably, tipping isn't solicited, yet their service merits it. It's no wonder my friends earmark Ichiran as their inaugural meal when visiting NYC. Without a doubt, I will return for another exceptional ramen experience.",1
15553,"I came in with a group of 5 on a Wednesday night at 6:15 PM. We thankfully had made a reservation beforehand so we were taken to our seats as soon as we arrived. Service was very efficient throughout the whole meal. We were helped by an older gentleman who came by right away to get our orders, bring by our bread and the rest of our meal. The restaurant itself was large and very open which is a nice space to seat so many customers. The bathroom though was a bit of a nightmare just the kind of area you would expect near grand central. We ordered five different types of pizza to share and they were a great choice. I really enjoyed the salsiccia pizza. The sausage and caramelized onions really worked well together. The four cheese pizza was also really delicious. The pizza itself was nice and crunchy on the bottom and soft on the top. Definitely a good order! There was also an order of the caeser salad for the table. The salad itself was kind of disappointing. I didn't realize that they served it with breadCRUMBS and not actual croutons. Therefore the bread flavor didn't really come out in the dish and there wasn't a satisfying enough crunch as I wanted. There was also not a lot of shaved Parmesan on top and each bite mostly felt like I was just eating saucy lettuce after saucy lettuce. All in all, pretty yummy pizza; however definitely skip the caeser salad and try to find another appetizer.",0

1999,"Title: A Delightful Sampling of China at Uluh

My friend and I ventured to Uluh, enticed by the allure of their renowned Peking duck. Amidst the Friday evening bustle, we secured our spot on the waitlist with a high-tech QR code system—a commendable modern touch. The inevitable hour-long wait was a small price to pay, efficiently spent nearby at St. Marks.

Once seated, we dove into a menu that promised a culinary tour of China's diverse flavors. Our adventure began with dan dan noodles, a mildly spicy introduction, followed by the piquant boneless pig trotters—tempered with an order of rice. A dim sum platter impressed us next, both generous and well-crafted.

The star, Uluh's signature Peking duck, made a grand entrance last. It donned a crispy, albeit slightly oily, skin and was presented with finesse—wrapped with care alongside an array of condiments.

While the pricing leans toward the higher end, the range from spicy to mild caters to all palates, making Uluh a worthy gastronomic experience. It's a place that beckons at least one visit for those who appreciate the rich tapestry of Chinese cuisine.",1

However, you're getting superb quality seafood.This is the kind of restaurant I'd imagine oil tycoons eat at when they're craving fish. The menu here can get real crazy, real fast. I've been to the Midtown location in the past and I would just warn that if you plan to order Market Price items - you should definitely ask what the costs are before you commit to them. Some of the appetizers here are $40+.I usually come here for the Business Lunch which is a 3-course at $32, totally reasonable for a restaurant of this caliber.My choices are typically the Octopus, Dorade Royal and the Walnut Cake for dessert.The spreads are a good appetizer but it can get quite filling with the pita. The spreads themselves are rich. The octopus is perfectly charred, served on a fava mash with capers and red onions. So good.The Dorade Royal is a whole grilled fish, deboned, filleted and is a spectacular value at this price. On my most recent visit, we also got the Lobster Pasta ($20 Supplement) and the Grilled Vegetables/Mushrooms. The pasta was good, very starchy, a lot of lobster meat but then again, you are paying for it. The vegetable entree was surprisingly good. Simply grilled, salt, a touch of olive oil - it was mushrooms grilled perfectly.For the desserts, the Walnut Cake with Ice Cream is good but I think the Greek Yogurt is my favorite. It's served with a bit of honey and some baklava on top.If you come with friends for lunch, you can each try different things and family style it up. If you're coming on a corporate card though, I'd go a la carte and wild out.",0

If you're scouring Yelp for a Filipino feast, Ugly Kitchen should top your list, especially during Filipino restaurant week. Nestled on a block shared with the esteemed Maharlika, Ugly Kitchen holds its own with a welcoming space, ample seating, and an inviting bar area. 

Be wise and snag a reservation, as the Saturday night buzz is testament to its popularity. Our gastronomic journey included the superb Chicken Adobo, hitting all the right flavor notes from sweet to subtly sour, with a kick of heat, all while maintaining a tender, juicy bite. The Bistek Tagalog continued the trend of tenderness and rich taste, leaving us nodding in culinary satisfaction. 

The grilled fish dishes impressed with their perfect seasoning, and the Laing was a standout for its absolute freshness. Communal dining with a jovial party of five, each dish was a hit. Despite the boisterous atmosphere, possibly magnified by our neighboring revelers, the service remained sharp and considerate.

While the roll was bursting with taste and adequately satisfied my snack craving, it's worth noting that it may not serve as a full meal for those with larger appetites. Priced just under $6, the chicken tikka roll offers good value for its size and is a flavorful pick-me-up for anyone looking for a quick, tasty treat.",1
14703,"We hardly hear a vegetarian restaurant receiving Michelin star and this is the one. We tried their egg in a hole, Nix benedicts and the vegetarian sausage. All of them were so good. The sausage tasted like the real one except the outside was a bit crispy. The egg benny was sooo good. The hollandaise sauce mixed in with the yolk, yum! The guac for egg in the hole was fresh. You can totally taste the freshness of the avocado. The server and the staff there were very friend too! Definitely will come back.",0
15897,"Went here on a thursday night and the place was packed.We were seated immediately at one of the big communal tables.There was only one waiter and we had to wait for more ten mins for water and the menus and another 15 min to order the food.The food started to arrive about 25 min after we ordered.They are still not equipped to handle a full house.We ordered the shrimp dumplings,chicken soup dumplings and the farmhouse chicken drypot.The dumplings were fresh and tasty.The only complaint i have is that the soup dumplings had very little soup.The farmhouse chicken drypot came along with white rice.It was very very tasty.Perfectly spicy and hot. Hope they hire more waiters and the service gets better.The place is worth visting for the food.",0
10871,"Title: A Worthwhile Visit to Madame Vo

After years of hesitation due to its prices, my fiancé and I finally decided to indulge our cravings for Vietnamese cuisine at Madame Vo. Despite the unexpectedly long 45-minute wait on a busy Saturday afternoon, the atmosphere inside the restaurant offered a blend of modern aesthetics with a touch of Vietnamese nostalgia, which was quite charming.

We chose to sit at the barstool setup in the back, which faced the wall. Eager to try something new, we ordered an avocado smoothie, which my fiancé had fond memories of. While he found it less sweet than his childhood treats, the smoothie was still enjoyable, and we happily finished it.

As for the grilled pork vermicelli, the dish was delightful with its unexpectedly sweet yet savory pork. However, I couldn't help but notice the sparing portion of noodles, a trend I've begun to associate with Vietnamese places in New York. The fish sauce and pickled vegetables were spot-on and complemented the meal perfectly.

In conclusion, Madame Vo offers delicious Vietnamese dishes that nearly justify their prices. Although the noodle portion left me wanting more, the overall experience was positive, and I'm pleased to have satisfied my long-held curiosity.",1
1501,"Title: A Delightful Prelude to Phantom of the Opera

I had the pleasure of dining at this Victorian Era gem on August 10th, just before my 72nd viewing of Phantom of the Opera, and I must say, it set the stage wonderfully for the afternoon. Though my husband missed out due to a clashing RPG game, a dear friend stepped in to join me.

The ambiance whisked us away to a different era with its stunning decor. Opting for mindful eating, I indulged in a single gluten-free pancake alongside two glasses of crisp Pinot Grigio. Remarkably, the pancake was reminiscent of a donut - a truly decadent treat that didn't derail my dietary goals.

While I don't typically enjoy a restaurant meal before a show, this experience was an exceptional exception. Without a doubt, I'd recommend this spot and certainly plan to return whenever my pre-theater traditions call for an indulgent yet mindful meal.",1
12040,"Title: A Late-Night All-You-Can-Eat Adventure

If you're planning to visit this all-you-can-eat establishment, heed my advice and book a reservation if your party exceeds four—unless you're prepared for a two-hour wait. Your best bet is to arrive early or swing by later in the evening, but be warned: the kitchen wraps up at 1 AM, an hour before the restaurant itself closes.

My companions and I rolled in at the cusp of midnight, hungry for the hotpot. While it was satisfactorily flavorful, arriving at 12:30 AM meant that we narrowly missed the full spread—many of the sauces and other food items were already picked over. It's worth noting though, that what we did try was pretty darn good.

In summary, this place is a solid choice for hotpot lovers and buffet enthusiasts, provided you time it right to avoid diminished late-night options.",1
12574,"Hits the mark for an elegant restaurant with a variety of fresh seafood. Love the diverse options of seafood on display where you can hand select what you want!The octopus starter is A MUST. It's the best octopus dish I've ever had. The cuts are thick and it's got the right amount of chew to it. The bean/hummus like mix it comes on top of is great.For a group of 5, we shared the tuna sashimi, Branzino, scallops, and langostinos. The size of the fish will blow your mind. The scallops were super meaty. The Branzino was prepared simply, but very good. The langostinos were generous in size as well.As for dessert, the Greek donuts were delicious! Light and airy on the inside and crispy on the outside. The Greek yogurt was drenched in some great honey. The baklava was good, but I think the other desserts stood out more.",0
1212,We were here for dinner. We ordered the grilled salmon dish and the cold maze combo platter and baklava for dessert. It was all reallyyyy good. Our server was really friendly and very attentive. We will be back soon to try the chicken dish. Great food and service.,0
2469,"Title: Charming Pre-Opera Dining at [Restaurant Name]

Before an evening at the opera, my friends and I chose [Restaurant Name] for a leisurely lunch. We kicked off the meal with well-crafted Sangrias and Mojitos, each sip setting a delightful tone for the dining experience.

Our entrées spanned a variety of Italian classics: Gnocchi, Pasta with Salmon, Penne in a robust red sauce, and a creamy Fettuccini. While all the dishes were competently prepared, they initially lacked a certain zing – a dash of olive oil, chili flakes, or salt and pepper, however, remedied this and brought the flavors to life.

The crowning jewel of our meal was the Tartufo dessert, a chocolate lover's dream. It's not only indulgent but generously portioned, making it perfect for sharing. Service was efficient and courteous, adding to the pleasant ambiance of the establishment.

In conclusion, [Restaurant Name] provides a comfortable and tasty dining experience – a solid choice for a pre-theater meal. The Tartufo is a must-try for those with a penchant for chocolate.",1
2680,"Small place, pretty tight between tables but still very worth it. All the food we had was great! I got the curry puff appetizer, which was so much better than o could have even imagined, it was like a Thai samosa.  Then I got the pad see ew with tofu, very good. My friends got the pineapple fried rice and pad Thai and we all agreed this was the best stop of weekend!",0
17359,"I love going to this place with a group of friends for their tapas. We got their kimchi cream udon, omu soba, one of the salads and skewers. There were so many things on the menu, I'm definitely coming back to try more things! Their happy hour is only an hour long but they do have frozen beer which I think isn't really worth it. Just had some slushy type ice on top of regular beer. Their cocktails are good with an average price. The food was delicious and the environment was super fun. Definitely a place to eat and drink any time of the week! It's easy to miss as the entrance is sandwiched between two other restaurants and it's indicated by a small sign. Their food is a bit fusion and I believe they do it well. The kimchi cream udon and omu sobs are a must try. The noodles are cooked perfectly on both and the kimchi does not overpower the taste. Have yakisoba inside the egg was interesting in a good way. I enjoyed my experience here and will probably be back. Make sure to join the waitlist because it can get pretty long!",0
10162,"We've just come back from China and this restaurant was a nice little reminder of the food we had in the trip. We ordered the house special soup noodles, and it was just right for a cold day in the city. We also ended getting the pan fried pork dumplings. Please do not skip on ordering this! We also tried the boiled vegging dumplings, however I prefer the pork more. When having any of the dishes be sure to try the chili oil, it had the right amount of spiciness. I cant wait to come back here and try more food.",0
14757,"Everything from the ambience, the food, and the service was perfect at Buddakan! I thoroughly enjoyed my entire experience here. The minute you walk in, they have attendants to greet you and check you in if you have a reservation. If your entire party isn't there yet, there is a nice bar to get drinks and hang out by while you wait.We had a reservation for 12 people at 6 PM on Friday night - definitely book a reservation if you plan on going during the weekend.  If you have 14 or more in your party, you'll need to book a private event.The food and the presentation was exquisite. We ordered only from the Tapas menu and enjoyed everything.  The appetizers we ordered included the oxtail dumplings, lobster egg rolls, short rib and scallion pancake, and chili rock shrimp. We also ordered the sizzling short rib, charred filet of beef, mongolian lamb chops, and lobster fried rice. We enjoyed every bite. In the end, our bill was around $850 after tip for all the drinks and food for 12 people. Not too bad for a great experience!",0
16346,"The server was very attentive and quick. The food was what you would expect at a bar. I ordered a Celtic Burger which came with sautéed mushrooms, cheddar cheese and Irish bacon...with a side of fries. I  did also order a drink that was similar a Ginger mule but I didn't taste much ginger in it. They have bathrooms upstairs and a few no ore down stairs to avoid peeing your pants after throwing back too many beers. The crowd seem to be familiar and they had many Televisions playing various games, therefore it's the perfect feat spot to take in your sports favorite.",0
10273,"Title: A Brunch Worth Celebrating

If I had the option, I'd gladly bestow an extra half star to this gem, nudging its rating to an impressive 4.5 stars. My birthday bottomless brunch adventure couldn't have been more splendid. The chosen venue accommodated our party of 13 with ease, and its charming decor bestowed a cozy French-European ambiance that was instantly inviting.

The staff outshined my expectations with their polite, friendly, and accommodating demeanor, a feat all the more impressive considering the bustling crowd they navigated. True to their word, ""bottomless"" was taken seriously here. Carafes were refilled almost by some unseen force, never once leaving us parched or peering for attention.

Speaking of deals, this spot boasts one of the finest brunch bargains I've encountered in New York—a refreshing revelation for someone who's often felt let down since trading the competitive brunch scene of LA for the Big Apple.

The volume of the music struck a perfect balance for a celebratory atmosphere without drowning out conversation. And for the grand birthday moment, a sparkler-topped chocolate mousse made for a delightful spectacle.

In short, this establishment gets an enthusiastic thumbs up for anyone scouting for that ultimate bottomless brunch experience.",1
2025,I have been wanting to come eat here for some years now. I'm glad I made it out with my Mom while she visits from California. She doesn't get out much so it's nice to bring her to a good restaurant. The ambiance is very beautiful with a casual vibe. There is a nice open kitchen. There are tables outside for seating. They accommodated us as a walk-in within a few minutes on a Saturday afternoon for Lunch. We shared the Ricotta and Honey dish which is a favorite flavor combination of mine! Then we had their version of Eggs Benedict . Very tasty and enjoyable!,0
12280,"Title: A Slice of Satisfaction at Local Pizzeria

I recently visited a local pizzeria and left thoroughly impressed. From the get-go, the line was manageable and service was prompt, ensuring a quick turnaround time from order to table.

The star of the show was undoubtedly the pizza. Opting for the supreme over a standard cheese, I was rewarded with a standout experience. The crust was thin and crispy, capturing that perfect pizza texture that enthusiasts seek. Each bite was a testament to their craft, with the toppings providing an ensemble of flavors.

The caprese did leave a bit of room for improvement. Although tasty, it would have benefitted from a touch more warmth. The mozzarella needed just a little more melt, and the tomatoes could have shaken off the chill.

Despite this minor hiccup, the meal was a success. The supreme pizza especially is a must-try for anyone who visits. I'll be back for another slice without question.",1
10550,"Title: A Tasty Touch of Tradition at Pig Heaven

Pig Heaven, nestled on the Upper East Side, retains its classic charm under the new ownership of the congenial Lisa. While the interior could benefit from a facelift, the atmosphere remains inviting and true to its origins with Nancy at the helm.

The culinary experience at Pig Heaven is nothing short of delightful. From the savory soup dumplings to the tender regular dumplings, each bite is packed with authentic flavor. The hot pot with beef is an absolute standout, offering generous portions that ensure you'll leave with leftovers. The soft shell crab is equally satisfying, perfectly prepared to satiate your seafood cravings.

This eatery stands out on the UES as a true sit-down Chinese restaurant amongst a sea of takeout options. Expect comforting, rich flavors across the board—ideal for both chilly nights and when you need a pick-me-up.

Service here is attentive and personable, with staff members regularly checking in to ensure dining satisfaction. There's a palpable eagerness to return, not just for the familiar tastes but also to explore the new dishes Lisa has introduced.

Overall, Pig Heaven is a must-visit for anyone seeking a hearty, flavorful Chinese meal in a welcoming setting.",1
11788,"My boyfriend and I stumbled upon a quaint little restaurant that, despite its size and the bustling crowd, turned out to be a culinary gem. The wait was a bearable 30 minutes for a table for two, but let me tell you, it was absolutely worth it. We shared three different dishes, each a delightful burst of flavor and creativity. The menu was impressively extensive — it's a challenge to make a choice with so many tempting options. Although we barely scratched the surface of the offerings, we're already excited to come back for more. Our eyes were continuously drawn to the mouthwatering plates being served around us. This place is a fun find that I'd highly recommend for any food lover out there.",1
18091,"I finally got to try the much-talked-about New York pizza, opting for a slice of chicken and pepperoni. True to the city's reputation, the pizza did not disappoint. Not only was it incredibly tasty, but the portion was also generous; a massive slice for just $3, which is great value for money. However, the experience was somewhat marred by the server, who lacked helpfulness and friendliness when I had questions. This service hiccup is the sole reason my rating is a 4 out of 5 stars, instead of a perfect score.",1
3574,"Title: Style Over Substance at This Hyped Spot

My evening at the highly-rated local eatery left me puzzled over its lofty reputation. While the establishment's creative decor and ambiance certainly set a delightful stage, the main act – the food – failed to wow.

Among the selection, the Carnitas Taco held some appeal, offering the most flavor, albeit with an oddly watery texture that necessitated draining before I could dress it up with corn and lime for an improved taste. The Al Pastor Taco, on the other hand, disappointed with its overly crunchy morsels, suggesting either an overcooking misstep or a peculiar interpretation of the dish.

The guacamole, alas, was a letdown, pureed into an unrecognizable blandness that lacked the robust zing of its traditional counterpart. On a brighter note, the side of corn was a tasty triumph and provided some redemption.

Service shone throughout the evening, with a friendly and attentive staff enhancing the dining experience. My quest for refreshment found solace in a Monopolio beer, a favorable nod to a classic Modelo, and the freshly squeezed juice, which both proved to be the highlights of my visit.

In summary, while the atmosphere and drinks were commendable, the culinary offerings at this beloved spot didn't match the hype. The standout corn and a chilled beer made for the best moments of the night.",1
2107,"Title: A Heart-Healthy Italian Affair at Mille Nonne

From the moment I stepped into Mille Nonne, the aroma of fresh ingredients and the warm greeting from co-owner Bernardo set the stage for what was to be an exceptional dining experience. This restaurant truly captures the essence of Italian cuisine with a health-conscious twist that doesn’t compromise on taste.

The Mille Nonne Lasagna was a revelation - the turkey Bolognese melded beautifully with the lactose-free bechamel, creating a creamy, flavor-packed dish that had me savoring every bite. Equally impressive was the Potato Gnocchi with their signature pesto - a creamy, nutty blend of arugula, basil, and sunflower seeds that was so satisfying, I didn't miss traditional cheese-based pesto one bit.

The Polpettine Balls, with their combination of turkey, spinach, and quinoa, were tender and well-seasoned, bathing in a perfectly crafted tomato sauce. The Arugola Salad, dressed in a zesty apple cider vinaigrette, provided a refreshing interlude between the richer courses.

I also had the pleasure of tasting the Pasta of the Day with tomato and eggplant, which was a testament to the kitchen's devotion to fresh, daily-prepared ingredients, as well as the Vegetable Lasagna, that didn't skimp on flavor.

To finish, the Tiramisu was sublime - lighter than air, it was the perfect end to a delightful meal. Chef Pilar, Bernardo's wife, has certainly crafted a menu full of healthier options that don’t forgo the indulgence Italian food is known for.

If you find yourself in the area, I highly recommend Mille Nonne for a guilt-free taste of Italy. It's a dining experience that celebrates the joy of eating well and eating healthy.",1
18258,"Okay, I don't actually know what happened because everyone I was with loved their lunch! But, alas, I wasn't blown away. I could definitely tell the lobster was fresh and it tasted delicious. The sauce was also very tasty but I think my tacos could have used more of it. I have to remember that extra sauce is usually the way to go. The lobster tacos are $16, definitely not a bad price for anything with lobster in it, but I was still hungry after lunch. If I ever come back, I might go for the traditional lobster roll and spring for the extra lobster, I think it's $5. I've always firmly believed you can never have too much lobster in any situation. Ever. The staff was very friendly and handled our gigantic group of 8 with ease and grace. Side note, is 8 considered gigantic? Never mind. We ordered at the counter one by one and it was no problem at all for them. Food came out pretty quickly too. The space is beautiful and comfy and casual and great for groups of any size. Even though I didn't love my meal I would definitely give them place another try and get something different. And get the extra sauce and the extra lobster.",0
13108,"Title: A Culinary Work of Art with a Disappointing Finale at Llama San

From the moment Pete Wells lauded Llama San, and Eater New York followed suit, I knew I had to experience it for myself. Despite the typical struggle of securing a table in the NYC dining scene, I managed to nab a reservation—a month in advance and at the early hour of 5:30 PM, but a seat at the bar nonetheless.

My adventure commenced with the Scallop Ceviche ($22), a dish that could easily hang in a gallery. The generous scallops, bathed in sweet and tangy chirimoya soup and adorned with black sesame and borage flowers, were nothing short of divine. The Tofu ($22), draped in a sublime aji amarillo sauce, proved that sometimes a humble condiment can steal the spotlight, while the Jasmine rice provided a delightful textural contrast.

The Chicken Thigh Maki ($28) was a clever twist on a sushi staple. The pour-over of the aji amarillo by the server may have been a bit theatrical, but it only enhanced the dish, with the olive tapenade serving as a sharp counterbalance.

As for the drinks, the Portuguese orange wine ($16) was a refreshing departure from the usual offerings, and despite the Quizas, Quizas, Quizas ($18) not hitting the right notes for me due to my personal distaste for matcha, it was interesting to see pisco featured in the cocktail.

However, the journey faltered at its final destination: dessert. The Satsuma Mandarin ($11) was a simple citrus granita—refreshing, yes, but a lackluster end to an otherwise exhilarating meal. It seemed desserts were an afterthought here, a common trend I've observed in some critically acclaimed establishments.

The service was professional, albeit with a touch of stiffness that bordered on comical. The bartenders, however, were exemplary in their attentiveness and willingness to share their expertise on the cuisine.

Patrons be advised: the bar area is cramped, and the seating may not cater to all comfort levels, which did detract from the experience.

In terms of value, the final bill of $127 (pre-tip) felt justified for the quality and uniqueness of the food, despite the less-than-perfect dessert and seating discomfort.

Overall, Llama San offered a memorable and tantalizing journey through Japanese-Peruvian flavors, earning a formidable 4.5 out of 5",1
11549,"Title: A Delightful Evening at Cobble and Co

Last night's dinner at The Seaport's Cobble and Co turned a thwarted boat ride plan into a memorable alfresco dining experience. Despite a stormy forecast, the weather held up, allowing for a pleasant stroll along Pier 17, where the waterfront breeze complemented the bustling maritime ambiance.

Cobble and Co caught our attention with its inviting atmosphere, proximity to live music, and an enticing menu boasting a variety of hearty dishes. Although known for their towering double-decker burgers – ranging from classic beef to unique tuna with sriracha sauce – we opted to sample the Snacks/Share section of the menu.

Our grazing adventure was a success with three standout dishes: a lusciously creamy, skillet-served mac and cheese; a surprisingly zesty fried cauliflower balanced by a soothing ranch sauce; and a duo of petite but flavorful tacos, with the chicken tinga being a highlight alongside a delectable aioli.

To wash it down, I took a chance on a 'Little Fancy' hard seltzer – a peach-infused rosé that pleasantly surprised my non-rosé-preferring palate. While the dessert options were limited to milkshakes, we passed after scoping out the nearby Big Gay Ice Cream Shop for a lighter option. Our choice, the ""Frenchie"" shake, was underwhelming and could not compete with the appeal of the local ice cream scene.

Service was a high point: Xavier, our waiter, combined top-notch attentiveness with a friendly demeanor – fellow Yankee fans, take note and ask for him!

Though we didn't explore the interior and upper lounge, the restaurant offers varied seating options to accommodate different preferences, all set against the Seaport's striking skyline view. Cobble and Co provides a splendid casual dining spot that capitalizes on its prime Seaport location. Whether you're there for the burgers or the bites, it's an experience worth your while.",1
11718,"ABCV is a venture from acclaimed chef of Jean-Georges, with a vegetarian/healthy leaning. My friend and I had previously made reservations here for a brunch, but they kept us waiting when we came in even though we were on time for our reservation, and didn't offer an apology. Ambience is very pretty, clean, and modern. It looked like it was The menu is entirely plant-based, with lots of interesting options. My friend went with the dosa, and I went with the sweet potato. The dosa was not bad, and my friend ate it in entirety, though remarked that it wasn't amazing. The sweet potato tasted like it had been very simply and plainly roasted, with a heap of salad dumped on top. I had to keep reaching for the salt to make it appeal more to my tastebuds.The servers here all have an annoying, new age way of calling customers ""friends"", ie. ""Friends, are we ready to order?"" I found the whole thing very unusual. Overall, not a great experience here.",0
21112,"Title: A Disappointing Encounter with Inauthentic Fare

I ventured to this well-rated eatery on a Sunday night, eager to delve into the American Chinese cuisine I've come to love, especially after witnessing the crowds on Friday nights. Regrettably, my dining experience fell profoundly short of expectations.

Despite its 4-star Yelp rating, the restaurant delivered a meal that was both underwhelming and overpriced. The menu tantalized with promises of authenticity, yet the reality was a series of poorly executed dishes that seemed to mock their traditional counterparts.

The scallion pancakes, inexplicably laced with bacon, lacked any semblance of flavor—a baffling feat for such a simple dish. The mapo tofu and stir-fried noodles were passable but failed to justify their price, given the modest portions. A $12.95 dish of sautéed string beans was not only bland but also astonishingly scant. The dry pot with fish was average at best, and other dishes proved so forgettable, they've escaped my memory.

However, there were some positives to note. The vegetarian mushroom and vegetable soup dumplings were a highlight, offering a glimmer of satisfaction in an otherwise lackluster meal. The service staff was commendable, providing attentive and friendly care throughout the evening. And while the ambiance was pleasant within the spacious setting, it could not compensate for the lackluster cuisine.

In a city where authentic and flavorful Chinese food abounds, this restaurant is not a destination I can recommend. Save your appetite and your dollars for the many superior options New York City has to offer.",1
18293,"If you're seeking a budget-friendly dining experience, especially for the little ones, look no further.

Trust me, you'll be glad you stopped by. I know I am!",1
1185,"Title: Happy Hour Delight at Chelsea Market's Seafood Gem

If you find yourself near Chelsea Market between 4pm and 6pm, don't miss the amazing happy hour at this casual yet chic seafood spot. While the price of oysters has slightly increased from $1 to $1.50 each, it remains an absolute steal for the freshness and variety on offer. I couldn't resist indulging in two rounds, savoring the remarkably sweet Vancouver oysters among others from around the country.

Beyond oysters, the menu boasts innovative delights such as chowder fries which, despite sounding unconventional, are a must-try, especially with the savory bacon bits sprinkled on top. The squid ink crepe with its perfectly fried oyster is exceptional; a single bite reveals a delightful burst of flavor. Don't pass up on the oyster tequila shooter – the mango salsa chaser is a brilliant touch.

This meal easily topped my list of dining experiences during my trip from New York. The bonus? While waiting for a table, you can enjoy a leisurely stroll around the charming Chelsea Market.",1

14292,"Title: Unexpected Price Hike and Unpleasant Service

I have been a regular patron of this establishment, frequently enjoying their large pepperoni pizza. However, my recent experience was disheartening. Upon placing my order over the phone, I was informed that the price would be $23, aligning with the rates listed on Yelp. To my dismay, the final charge escalated to $28, a discrepancy that was neither explained nor justified. Sadly, the customer service quality has equally diminished, with the staff showing indifference to my concerns regarding the price inconsistency. The lack of transparency and courtesy has left a sour taste, and I am compelled to reconsider my patronage.",1
14522,"This was my third visit and the best thus far. Everything from start to finish was perfect and the wine pairing went magnificently. It's always difficult to choose the favorites when you have so many courses but a few did stand out. I particularly enjoyed the langoustine etouffee. The flavoring was on point, as if I was in New Orleans, yet it looked like an entirely different dish. The iconic oysters and pearls are iconic for a reason, they were absolutely delicious. The steak three-way was also epic. How often do you have A5 wagyu, Dry aged, and coulotte all on one plate?Chef Mel hit it out of the ballpark on this one. It was a great birthday lunch.

15818,"Title: A Delightful Lunch at Wokuni

My fiancé and I decided to visit Wokuni for a lunch date and were delighted from the moment we walked in. Seated immediately, our experience only continued to impress. The attentive service began with water and menus promptly arriving at our table.

Opting for the Wokuni-Don, a special served in limited quantities, we made an excellent choice. I also indulged in a 6-ounce cup of beer for a mere two dollars—a fantastic bargain.

The meal was an elaborate affair, each entrée accompanied by soup, salad, and a petite appetizer. The Wokuni-Don, a chirashi bowl, may have appeared modest at first glance but was deceptively satisfying. A medley of exquisitely cut, supremely fresh sashimi rested atop a bed of rice. The inclusion of both tempura shrimp and vegetables in the bowl made the dish indulgently delicious.

An unexpected surprise was their offering of fresh produce for sale, a testament to their quality and service. Our lunch at Wokuni was a delightful experience that ensured our return in the future.",1
18685,"Whenever it's one of my friend's birthday, we inevitably end up eating dinner at 99 Favor. It's hard to go wrong with this place. They have tables of all sizes to accommodate your groups. There are a ton of small individual stoves for your picky eaters. And they have endless ingredients to satisfy everyone's tastebuds. In terms of broths, although I generally like spicy food, their spicy broth has way too much peppercorn. I recommend the kimchi or pork bone instead. The birthday queen/king gets to eat for free (must show ID), and they have a 3 day window.-They get a small bowl of ice cream with a candle. (If it's not your birthday, don't cry. Check in on yelp for your very own ice cream scoop!) -AND there is a DANCING BIRTHDAY MONKEY that comes to your table while they play a taped birthday song.Overall super fun place, and come knowing that you will probably have to waddle out the door from all the good food you're gonna experience here.",0

11071,"Barbounia is built for a certain kind of person, and that person wants a loud, sizzling candle in their birthday dessert among a group of friends while everyone else looks along. This restaurant is so flashy that I seriously thought a belly dancer would pop out at any moment. That didn't happen, but I kid you not, there was an unnecessarily loud birthday song blasting through the entire restaurant every five minutes that made it so hard to converse; even the wait staff kept rolling their eyes and like they knew it was extreme. The waiter we had was present, but very robotic and stuffy. They didn't come across as friendly to me, in general. This was strange, but the actual restaurant is anything but stuffy. The grand arches on top, the throw pillows strewn about, and the expansive space do add a luxurious vibe to the space. Tuna salad - this was my entree, and I was so disappointed with it. It's first on my list because everyone should know to avoid this. The actual tuna was great, and comes with an egg, but I wish there was more tuna and less everything else, but nothing else besides the protein part was enjoyable. The worst part about it was that it was absolutely drenched in mayo, so much so that I seriously disliked eating it. Vegetable crudites - basic veggies, including carrots, green beans, cucumbers, and radishes. Obviously healthy, but so jokingly overpriced for what they're serving. Feta omelette - this is actually an enormous omelette, but the egg part tasted fake, and there are very few vegetables inside. It comes with a great little salad and some potatoes that I enjoyed, but the omelette was disappointing. Hummus - has chickpeas on it, and is a generous portion. Comes with this amazing rosemary bread that goes so well with the hummus. A Middle Eastern girl like me will have experienced a million types of hummus by now, and one thing I will tell you is that it should not cost $8.50 for a half cup of it. Coffee - they had no almond milk or soy milk (come on now...), but the coffee is good and there are free refills. They brought me honey to mix in.Overall, I really wasn't impressed with the food, and the ""see and be seen"" vibe isn't my jam, so I didn't think this was worth the money.",0
2805,Dare I say it's just as good as the OG Chicago location? Our party of four was seated right away for weekday lunch in a nice booth. Place filled up fast so I'm glad we came earlier (around 12:30). I had the mint lemonade - there's an adjacent coffee shop that provides such drinks - and shared a double cheeseburger and French fries. Mille-feuille for dessert was perfect. I do think the burger at 4 Charles Prime Rib is slightly more phenomenal but this one is up there.,0
1000,"During my visit to this eatery, drawn in by a craving for Taiwanese flavors, I encountered a street food-style ambiance, promising staples such as salt and pepper chicken, beef noodle soup, and fried pork chop over rice. Unfortunately, the service and food quality both fell into the realm of the mediocre. My beef noodle soup was marred by overcooked beef, detracting significantly from my dining experience. Based on this visit, I have no plans to return.",1
10731,"I'm very disappointed in this place- meals were (just) ok, but upon making a reservation, no one gave us a drink menu or took our orders for an entire 32 minutes. Really not great, especially with all the other plentiful, delicious, prompt options in the area. Service was nonexistent and took ages.  Totally unapologetic. Host was clearly frazzled and barking at everyone (myself included), so this really did not feel like a warm welcome.Hot pots were bland, albeit hot and cute -ly presented. (I'd rather have tasty food if I had to choose...)I would possibly give this 2 stars. Will update if needed. Actually 2 sounds about right in retrospect.",0
1454,"During a Saturday lunch visit with my family and a friend, we experienced the bustling ambiance of this restaurant, where we were seated close to the bar. Despite the crowds, this location proved suitable for families. Our server was affable and managed to maintain a smile, although the bustling nature of the establishment led to a slower service pace. The fare, consisting of sandwiches and pizza, was flavorful and met our expectations. The restaurant's layout was notably appealing, leaving me looking forward to returning on my next trip to the area.",1
123,"Tucked away in a charming corner of the city, this eatery offers a delightful ambiance perfect for capturing memories in photographs. However, potential patrons should note the lack of indoor waiting space—something to consider during hotter days as the queue can stretch considerably. Despite the wait, visitors are regularly treated to lively entertainment courtesy of performers engaging the crowd, enhancing the overall experience.",1
14228,"If you're on the hunt for top-notch pizza in Murray Hill, your quest ends here. Make sure to try the chicken vodka slice – it’s a standout that even this Bay Ridge, Brooklyn native can't get enough of. With its incredibly fresh chicken and a vodka sauce that's just the right kind of light, it's a slice that easily ranks among Manhattan's finest. And while you're at it, don't skip the garlic knots; they're a cut above those you'll find elsewhere. Simply put, it's perfection in every bite.",1
17507,"Experience was worth the 4 stars but food was more like a 3 star. Most important thing to note when coming, they won't seat you unless your whole COMPLETED party is here and there is no numbering system. Good thing there's a bench near the entrance of the shop which I was planted on for almost an hour (Thanks my friends).Even though the shop filled up soon with customers constantly streaming in after opening, the limited serving lunch box set was still available when I was seated. I chose cold soba instead of hot for my lunch box set.The cold soba was a classic, hard to go wrong with it. Salmon, salad, and sweet potato was pretty good. I enjoyed the block of sushi rice with salmon roe and egg on top. The only things I didn't like were the lotus slices, kale underneath the mushroom and the probably yellow radish in the middle. I didn't expect to also be served fried tempura as well. At the end, after our meal was cleaned up and we were given the bill, I received the dessert of the tofu pudding with strawberry jam on top which was included in the lunch box set. It was a clean and sweet way to end the meal. I would definitely order a bigger serving of it if they had to share with friends.The lunch box was definitely worth its price with everything that was served with it but I was not blown away the taste of the food.I would go again if I was aiming to impress friends in having a nice experience overall.",0
3597,"PURCHASED: the Italian Sandwich TOTAL: $13-ish (*paid $1, message me for details) PROS:+ quick: I have got coffee here before approximately 2-3 times in the mornings. In those instances they have provided significantly satisfying customer service; they were quick with the order. However, I am reviewing the episode I received their sandwich and not their coffee. CONS: - NON-fresh ingredients: The sandwich included several different meats which one would expect in an Italian cuisine (e.g., capicola, salami, et cetera). However, the meat did not taste like what I have been used to. Subway's ""Italian BMT"" beats this by 2.5x (and is significantly CHEAPER).- not toasted: my bread was not toasted. It tasted terrible on their Ciabatta bread. I did not even finish one half. I asked if a homeless person would have wanted my other half.IMPRESSION: this deserves a 3-star rating only because the quality of the meat was terrible. Go to Subway for 'wiches. This place is sort of a joke. It is saved by the coffee visits I have taken here.",0
12207,"Wandered here on a Saturday afternoon looking for a decent brunch spot with outside seating. Got a nice table in the shade and was immediately given menus/water when we sat down.Interesting Brunch Special which nets you an entree, coffee or tea, and an alcoholic beverage for $22. Went for the Breakfast Wrap, coffee, and a Bloody Mary. Coffee comes first - a generous pour of hot coffee with refills to boot. Bloody Mary is next - lots of hot sauce and a solid amount of booze; wish it was larger but can't complain with the price. As for the food, the fries are deliciously crisp and the wrap/burrito is hefty (lots of eggs and meat). Only downside were the greens to the side which didn't taste fresh. Pro tip - they give more fries if you don't want the salad.Really liked the service and food here, as well as the reasonable pricing. A welcome change of pace from the normal brunch places.",0
13832,"Title: A SoHo Gem Perfect for Any Time of Day

I've had a soft spot for this charming restaurant chain since its early days in SoHo, NYC. The white and blue-themed decor adorned with delightful bunnies creates a relaxing, chic atmosphere ideal for brunch or lunch. This location boasts a cozy sit-down area and a front section dedicated to grab-and-go coffee and pastries. The staff is genuinely warm and welcoming, enhancing the dining experience.

The menu celebrates simplicity, focusing on the honest flavors of high-quality ingredients. I skeptically ordered the waffle iron hash brown, but to my surprise, I savored every last bite. Paired with perfectly smoked salmon that was flavorful without being too salty, crispy hash browns, and fresh avocado, it was a dish where each component shone on its own. It’s an emblem of the restaurant’s dedication to freshness without relying on heavy sauces.

Whether you're stopping by for a coffee, a leisurely breakfast, or a catch-up lunch with a friend, the mellow jazz tunes add to the inviting ambiance. This spot has quickly become a favorite of mine, and I foresee many more visits in my future.",1
14347,"Stopped by here after work on a Thursday night for a quick meal. Despite the happy hour, not many people inside the restaurant, so was able to grab a seat at the bar immediately.Happy hour is 4:30-7pm Monday-Friday with specials on drinks as well as small plates. Decided on the Chicken Satay ($6) to go along with a draft beer ($6). Meal includes two skewers of grilled chicken, peanut sauce, and a small side salad. have to admit that the chicken was not very good - tough meat that tasted old. Peanut sauce did not help matters much, though the side salad was fine enough.Server here is very thorough and even warned patrons of the happy hour ending soon. Probably wouldn't eat here again, but would go back for drinks.",0
10884,"Title: A Taste of Ethiopia Worth Returning For

I recently dined at a fantastic Ethiopian restaurant with a group of friends, and the experience left quite an impression. Despite it being a busy Saturday night at 8pm, we were greeted and seated instantly by the incredibly welcoming staff.

The meal was an absolute delight, with the injera bread being a generous highlight. While the Doro Wot did not quite hit the mark for me – its portion size didn't justify the cost – it was the only dish that didn't dazzle. Presentation-wise, the Doro Wot looked lost on the plate, dwarfed by other more satisfying options.

The only hiccup came at the end of the night; obtaining the bill was a challenge, requiring multiple requests and a 10-minute wait. Nonetheless, the culinary experience was strong enough to guarantee my return. For lovers of Ethiopian cuisine, this place is definitely worth a visit.",1
3276,"I actually think the food here is great and a solid portion size for the price. Most dishes will run you around $14-$15 and come with meat and three sides, and it can easily last you for two meals.I usually opt for the pork and the sides I get vary, although the sweet plantains, white bean and avocado salad, and Moro rice are some of my favorites. The green sauce they give you to accompany it is great as well. Packaging is good for delivery/pick up. I've ordered the steak and onions before too and it was good, but I think the pork is the way to go. Sweet plantains are absolutely delicious. Will absolutely order again. Best with some salt but the green sauce does a lot in terms of flavor.",0
19312,"Awesome food and very affordable. Most of their items are under $9. You can get a kati roll with egg in it for about $4. I opted for the kosha mangsho which is a goat/mutton roll. The meat was so flavorful and tender. I was hesitant about getting it because I've only had goat once before and it was pretty dry that time, but I definitely did not regret getting the goat meat here. The paratha wrap was thin and flaky. You can swap it out for a wheat roti if you want something heavier. The richness of the meat contrasted nicely with the refreshing crunchiness of the onions and carrots in the roll.They make everything after you order it, so you know your food will be hot and fresh. It was a very satisfying meal. I will probably get something cheaper next time, as the goat kati was a little under $9.One thing I don't like is that they charge you for dipping sauce. Tbh I felt that the meat was flavorful and moist enough that it didn't need sauce, but not sure if the same can be said of the meatless options on the menu, as I haven't tried those yet.",0
1350,"Great value sushi place! There are no tables to sit but the lunch special was a great price. You got 6 pieces of nigiri (salmon, tuna and yellowtail) and a roll of choice (I choose) tuna, along with a miso soup for $15! Docked it one point because there is no sitting area, but would recommend for a quick and high value lunch.",0
12359,"Since I stared using Yelp, I am trying most of the places first time. Friday night we chose the go that pace.The ambiance of the restaurant was so nice. I highly recommend before you go to that place, you should make a reservation in order to have a nice table. Second floor, they have Volkswagen van converted to table which was so cool and I extremely enjoyed the time.Our server Ashley, was so sweet. She came all the time and checked our table if we need anything else. We stared with cocktails. I had buffalo terrace bourbon old fashion. It was so delicious.As an appetizers, we order fried chicken sliders. Omg it was so delicious and it came two sliders seems like full size of meal.I got 12oz. New York strip steak. The sauce on top was so delicious. Brace of I was so full from appetizers, I would be able to finish my steak.As a desert, we ordered dark chocolate ganache cake. Gosh! It was very intense an so yummy. Also our friend orders pistachio and vanilla gelato. Both tase was so good and cant wait to go and try for another round.",0
14028,"I recently had the pleasure of dining at a hidden gem of a restaurant that immediately captivated me with its superb customer service, which I'm convinced was provided by the owner themselves.

The food was not only delicious but also presented with an eye for detail. Without a doubt, I look forward to returning for another exceptional meal.",1
3089,"Title: A Delightful Omakase Gem - Omakase by Teisui

I recently had the pleasure of dining at Omakase by Teisui and what an exceptional experience it was! With anticipation, I opted for their attractively priced 12-piece omakase at just $60, a true bargain considering the quality. For different appetites, they offer a ""lite"" and a premium version as well.

Making a reservation to sit at the sushi counter proved to be a wise choice, enhancing the dining experience with front-row seats to the culinary action. The ambiance resonated with classic Japanese elegance, setting the stage for an authentic experience.

Kickstarting our meal, we shared a sake carafe, well-priced and a fitting prelude to the sushi that followed. For the adventurous, they also offer a sake flight for just $20.

The array of sushi, from the opulent fatty tuna to the perfectly seared salmon and the exquisite sea urchin, was a parade of delights. Each piece was exceptional, with no missteps in the lineup. The omakase also included a complimentary appetizer, a satisfying egg dessert, and tea — a complete package that left me full, yet comfortably so.

Service was impeccable, with our meal paced perfectly, allowing us to savor each piece without feeling rushed. While the sushi chef's interaction was minimal, the menu provided ample guidance.

In summary, Omakase by Teisui delivers an authentic, traditional experience at an unbeatable value. This restaurant is a must-visit for any omakase aficionado. Highly recommended!",1
16837,"Amazing experience at Jongro! Went in a group of 6 on a Saturday night around 9pm. Luckily did the waitlist because the place was packed (even when we left at 11pm). Between the 6 of us, we split the Beef Platter, Large Marinated Beef Platter, and the Pork Short Ribs with 2 Sojus. It was the right amount of food for a hungry group. While the meat is not AYCE, the sides were and our server frequently replenished them. Our server/griller was very friendly and helped us navigate the menu. I really enjoyed the Peach flavored Soju that he suggested. Overall it was a great activity/experience and only came out to about $50 a person which was not that pricey for the amount of meat we got and the quality. The only potential downside was that it was very toasty inside since there are so many open flames and it was a very hot day outside. I would definitely return!!!",0
16767,"I was pleasantly surprised my boyfriend after hopping off the subway to find out that we were going to the famous Sylvia's. Upon walking in on a cold night I felt warmly greeted to a home feeling type of restaurant. We were seated and instantly served some fresh hot corn bread, yum. PRO TIP limit your self on that delicious corn bread, trust the food needs your appetite. I was so excited to see that they had creamy mac and cheese like how mom makes it. SO you already know we got several ordered of that. We landed on the grilled shrimp. with double mac and I needed a sweet tea. After a few minutes drinks were dropped off and more hot corn bread. This sweet tea is sweeter than I was ready for, BUT I loved every single drop of it. The homemade tea was def made with love. A short wait later, our meals were dropped off. I have never in my life had grilled shrimp like Sylvia's. It was perfectly grilled, smokey and seasoned. The seasoning was PERFECT. Not to outshine the amazing mac and cheese. It was perfectly moist, cheesy and seasoned as well. NO lack of flavor here. Overall Sylvia's was a great home cooked tasting restaurant.",0
14879,"Title: Disappointing Dining Experience at [Restaurant Name]

I regret to say that my experience at [Restaurant Name] was less than pleasant. Drawn in by a Yelp check-in offer, my visit began on a sour note when I was informed the deal had expired. The highlights of my meal were few, with the green tea being a sole exception.

Unfortunately, the meal took a downturn from there. The soup lacked any discernible flavor, the salad was mundane, and the edamame was under-seasoned. The sushi was particularly disappointing; not only did it lack visual appeal, but it also fell short in taste, leading me to leave behind a portion of my order. Furthermore, it seemed I didn't even receive everything I was supposed to.

My advice to fellow diners would be to seek out other establishments for a satisfying meal, as I left [Restaurant Name] with a lingering sense of dissatisfaction and a slightly upset stomach.",1
15935,"I recently dined at this charming little spot that's become the talk of the town. Without a reservation system, you might want to take a leisurely approach – either arrive early or be prepared to enjoy the outside scene before getting your table. Fortuitously, I snagged a seat at the bar immediately upon arrival.

The menu was a delight, and my choice was an egg sandwich served on an utterly delicious biscuit that hit all the right notes. It's rare to find a place that exudes such warmth and simplicity while delivering on taste. I'm already looking forward to my next visit!",1

Which is something I thought I'd never say.Get ready for thick, crispy, garlic-packed pizza with fresh marinara and mozzarella, and abundant toppings of eggplant and honey and basil. For $4.50 you get this sensational slice of pizza that blows you away.You've gotta get the eggplant slice and the honey-ricotta slice. The eggplant slice is topped with a massive crushed, fresh tomato, and a long leaf of basil. It's sweet, savory, full of garlic. The honey-ricotta slice is insane; that sumptuous mix of sweet and savory, which is shocking coming from a red sauce purist. The owner and chef grew up making Play-Doh models of pizza as a kid, totally obsessed with pizza. He's now been making pizza for 17 years in Staten Island (the pizza Mecca), Brooklyn, and now the East Village.I can't wait to come back and try the full gamut of slices, from the pepperoni to the a la vodka to the cheese and margarita. See you soon! 5 stars!!!!!!",0
2907,"The hype is real.  It's one of the best slices in the city.  I did a lot of pizza research before coming to NY and Joe's was a recurring recommendation.  This is NOT the original location, but it is close to Time's Square and Javits center.The cheese is simple perfection. The crust is thin and perfect.  Folds perfectly.  They have very limited seating.  I'd get my slice to go and eat it outside.  Credit cards only if over $5 purchase.Make sure you know what you want before getting to the counter so you don't hold up the line.",0
16927,"My husband and I had a wonderful time here for his birthday dinner. Another couple joined us, along with their toddler, which was a struggle, but the staff accommodated us very well because I informed them prior to our arrival that we might have a stroller and they reserved a large table for us so that we'd have plenty of space and be out of the way.When we first walked up, I was unsure of how a stroller would actually even make it in the place but they have a mini lift which means that they're wheelchair and stroller accessible. It's nice to see places offer access to people who may need special accommodations.The ladies at the host podium were amazing. They made us feel very welcome and not at all a bother. We were able to park my girlfriend's stroller out of the way and put her son in a high chair. I was pregnant at the time so my husband and I were good.Our server was the sweetest. We were one of the last tables seated but we never felt rushed. All of the food was amazing. We were all very happy with our meals.Charcuterie Board - served with a lot of goodies but most items I couldn't eat, like the soft cheeses and cured meats (pretty much everything). I snuck some small tastes here and there but mainly just nibbled on the accoutrements.Clam Chowder - served New England style and very creamy. I loved every bite.Duck Confit w/Risotto - spectacular, with a perfect consistency. I was happy with my choice even if I couldn't taste any of the tartare my friend ordered, which was a bummer.Truffles - very decadent and rich. I think I ate most of them myself.Everyone else had their Steak Tartare, Pork Chops and Brick Chicken. They all enjoyed their dishes. On our way out, we took some cute photos in front of their ""vault"". It was a nice experience but I would definitely like to visit for a real date night without the kids, both walking and floating in a belly.Definitely make reservations and if you're going for after work libations, get there early because they get packed.

2472,"Eager anticipation surrounded my visit to the Michelin-starred Uncle Boons, renowned for its buzzing crowds and stellar reputation. My friend and I joined the eager diners in line 15 minutes before the 5:30 PM opening, and by the time doors opened, the queue had extended down the block—a testament to the restaurant's allure.

Seated promptly, Latoya, our attentive server, took our orders. Our appetizer, the fried pig ears, arrived perfectly fried with a crisp reminiscent of pork rinds, enhanced by a selection of sauces and a burst of freshness from a squeeze of lime. The main event was equally impressive; my friend's Khao soi kaa kai was a visual and flavorful delight, with tender chicken swimming in a golden curry accented by coconut milk. Sharing the grilled seafood platter, we reveled in the standout charred octopus, sizeable prawns, and flaky yellowtail collar—all expertly paired with Thai dipping sauces.

My first encounter with roasted bone marrow was intriguing; served with grilled brioche and a fitting peanut sauce, the texture was soothingly familiar to pork belly aficionados.

Uncle Boons delivered an impeccable dining experience, ensuring a swift return to sample the enticing crab fried rice and green curry snails. A notch above in service, the staff courteously refolded napkins whenever guests stepped away, solidifying Uncle Boons (alongside Ugly Baby) on my list of authentic Thai gems in the city.",1

15405,"I recently visited a local restaurant that, despite its excellent service, failed to win me over with its cuisine. Upon arrival, I encountered a bit of a quirky situation where the entryway was so dimly lit that another patron and I humorously struggled to find the door. However, the restaurant policy of not seating incomplete parties caused a slight inconvenience.

Once we were seated, our waitress was the highlight of the evening. She provided outstanding service with impeccable politeness, enthusiasm, and superb recommendations. Her efficiency and charm were the kind that make you want to befriend her instantly.

Unfortunately, the food did not match the high standard set by the service. The pig's ears appetizer had a challenging texture that I personally found off-putting. The tuna with cucumber was nicely flavored but awkwardly portioned, making it difficult to eat. As for the main course, the tonkotsu ramen I ordered fell flat for me as the broth lacked the robust flavor I crave, and even omitting meat shouldn't result in a bland broth. My guest's spicy coconut curry ramen was passable, but again, nothing to write home about.

In summary, while the service was exceptional, the culinary experience was underwhelming. I doubt I'll return, as the food left a lot to be desired.",1
16258,"My second time here was much better than my first. I had to give up caffeine for my stomach so I felt like I deserved a fancy chai.

My recent visit to the local vegan spot deserving a solid 3.5 stars, which I'll round up for its uniqueness as the only morning vegan takeout in town. The ""Sunrise"" wrap caught my eye, boasting a punchy tofu and ""chorizo"" mix that delivered on flavor and spice. Although delicious, the wrap's construction was uneven, leading to an inconsistent filling distribution and an excessively oily texture that wasn't the best choice for such a filling. Despite this, the tantalizing promise of their ""Early Bird"" wrap and the hope for an expanded breakfast menu has me planning a return visit. This place shows potential and could soon become a morning staple for vegans on the go.",1

The consistently long lines are a small price to pay for the delight of sinking your teeth into their gloriously cheesy slices. My experience? Four scrumptious slices and a couple of refreshing drinks came to just over $20, making it a reasonably priced indulgence. The walls, peppered with snapshots of celebrities, attest to Joe's fame and popularity. Joe's is more than just a meal—it's the perfect complement to a day spent savoring the city's sights and sounds.",1

12990,"Title: Authentic Noodles with a Side of Dumpling Delight

I recently visited a local spot renowned for its Lan Zhou noodles, which did not disappoint. The noodles were cooked to perfection, achieving that coveted al dente texture that noodle aficionados like myself crave. While the dining area was nothing out of the ordinary, reminiscent of a typical Chinatown eatery, the restaurant is quite accommodating to groups of various sizes.

I indulged in a bowl of noodles which, despite the broth falling slightly flat in flavor, still made for a satisfying meal. However, it was the steamed dumplings that truly stole the show - packed with taste and perfectly complementing the noodle dish.

A word to the wise: this establishment does not provide complimentary water, so come prepared with your own bottle to quench your thirst. Overall, for an authentic noodle experience with the bonus of exceptional dumplings, this place is certainly worth a visit.",1
10025,"I recently dined at L'Artusi, and it's an experience I won't soon forget. Nestled in the heart of NYC, this gem delivered on all fronts: the ambiance sets the perfect mood, the service was impeccable, and the FOOD – simply sublime.

Our culinary journey featured a delightful roasted mushroom dish, sumptuous pappardelle, a standout ravioli that I believe was a daily special, a succulent pork chop, and the most divine crispy potatoes. The pork chop and potatoes were particular highlights, but the ravioli also left a strong impression.

Do note, scoring a reservation requires some forethought – we booked ours 30 days out for a reasonable dinner hour. Trust me, the effort to plan ahead is more than justified. L'Artusi offers a meal that will linger in your senses long after the last bite.",1
1341,"I recently stumbled upon a hidden gem that serves up what might just be the best katsu curry in the city, and it's quickly become my go-to spot. Dubbed as 'fast food,' this place defies that label with the quality of its offerings. The tonkatsu is always fresh, boasting a satisfying crunch and tenderness, while the curry is simply excellent—rich, flavorful, and aromatic, reminiscent of the authentic tastes from my days in Japan.

One of the highlights is the option for extra pickles, which are a perfect complement to the dish. Conveniently located near my workplace, it's become a regular fixture for my lunch routine. For anyone thinking of heading to go go curry, I'd strongly suggest giving this place a try instead. It's a culinary delight not to be missed.",1

The food is delicious and the staff won't let your glass hit empty if you've ordered mimosas.

Anyone who knows me knows I don't do eggs in any form, but I will make the best of it for this dish. The short ribs are prepared expertly and the poached eggs really do enhance the dish. The only down side here is the 2 hour limit on bottomless (and honestly, that's probably the responsible thing to do in this situation lol). Lido is my preferred bottomless brunch spot in the city, for sure.",0
20177,"This French-inspired Korean bakery practically appeared overnight  at this new location with the distinctive blue coloring and theme.The layout is the newer Café version where the counter person may prepare or heat up the item you want vs. the older model where you select cold items from the shelves and place them on your tray. You still find some of the popular Paris Baguette favorites but much less of them.  This store is bigger than most of the Paris Baguette you find in midtown and the very spaciousness of the layout lets you mingle around the displays and service areas. The breads, pastries, cakes here are like most Asian bakeries, they tend to be softer and sweeter than your typical American or European bakery. You will find the desserts are great and not as sweet and are more on the lite side when compared to Madison Kayser. and then you have Soups, sandwiches, and beverages to pick from, breakfast, lunch, dinner and late night snack.I am not sure what will happen to the other Paris Baguette on 7th Avenue a block away.

Service was both friendly and prompt, which is always a plus.

I loved the green, red and yellow sauces that came with the burrito. Definitely a solid deal for a solid meal. Will be back.",0
12395,"I recently dined at this BBQ gem on a Wednesday evening with my sister and had a delightful experience. Determined to indulge in the tableside BBQ, we ordered both the pork belly and the bulgogi. To our delight, the portions were generous, and the quality and seasoning of the meat were simply superb. Accompanied by an array of panchan, crisp lettuce, fresh scallions, and delectable sauces, it was a feast we struggled to finish.

While the venue could benefit from improved ventilation—my attire retained the evening's aromas—the service more than compensated for it. The staff demonstrated exceptional skill in cooking our selections and remained attentive throughout the meal.

I'm already planning my next visit to explore more BBQ delights. A bonus tip for fellow diners: checking in on Yelp grants you a complimentary order of scrumptious fried dumplings. Don't miss out!",1
3229,"Came here for my anniversary as a surprise and it was such an amazing experience. All the dishes were made with such skill and detail, the ambiance was relaxing and with such excellent service. I must say we had a tough time deciding what to eat but don't hesitate, just go for it! The foie gras, 100 day aged beef and black truffle pasta was all worth it, tasted delicious and we savored each bite. Sandra, the sommelier, the staff and chefs were so accommodating for our food allergies and came up with such delicious substitutes. Especially the dessert! I don't know what was in the peanut butter ice cream but it was incredible and I would like to know the recipe! The chocolates, at the end, were not only beautiful but delicious, matcha green tea with raspberry. Also, it was such a sweet touch that we were given little gifts to remember that special day. Thank you.",0
11834,"This place is so darn cute! It's spacious with beautiful lighting  and perfectly sized booths for small - mid sized groups. Came here with a group of 9 but 10 would've probably been a little too cramped. Overall, the food was ok, but nothing to brag about..We ordered a bunch of appetizers and sides to share and then each got our own entrees. We started off with the calarmi and eggplant parm, but I think we could've done without the calamari.For sides we got roasted fingerling potatoes and broccoli rabe which was actually pretty unnecessary since we all ordered pasta. My main dish was definitely the star. The 3 meat rigatoni was delicious! Slightly spicy, very flavourful and the perfect amount of al dente. Unfortunately my bf had the clam linguini that wasn't as satisfying...We got some dessert, I don't know what but it was fine. Overall, a nice place to dine and enjoy your dinner but probably not the best bang for your buck as a serious foodie.",0
1846,"Came for brunch with a decent sized group. Food and drinks came out pretty fast. The drink options were different, my friend got vodka infused bacon. The champagne pitcher was enough for four and very tasted very fruity.The omelettes had big portions with a lot of potatoes. Unfortunately the bowl I got with cauliflower wasn't very filling or what I expected",0

My dining experience at this restaurant was nothing short of outstanding. From the moment we arrived, the attentive staff welcomed us promptly, ensuring we were comfortably seated without delay. The meal commenced with an exquisite serving of clams oregano, bathed in a divine sauce that was so irresistible, we found ourselves savoring every last drop with our bread. The shrimp cocktail followed, boasting four generous, succulent pieces that were a true testament to quality.

Our main course, the porterhouse for two, was cooked to perfection, a harmonious blend of flavor and tenderness. Accompanying the steak, the mushrooms were notable for their expert seasoning, while the cream of spinach indulged us with its decadent, creamy texture. Sides of house-made potato chips and crispy onions didn't disappoint, delivering a satisfying crunch that proved to be quite addictive.

The personal touch of a cartoon mural featuring the owner and his brothers added a unique charm to the atmosphere, enhancing the dining experience. Without hesitation, I look forward to returning to this gem of a restaurant for another exceptional meal.",1
10144,"I've visited this restaurant multiple times for lunch and dinner, and I can confidently say their arepas are top-notch. The Miss Piggy, La Sureña, De Pabellón, and Hot Queen have all been exceptional, bursting with flavors and generously stuffed to satisfaction. One arepa per meal has been more than enough to leave me full and content. Highly recommend for an arepa experience that does not disappoint!",1

20422,"This is must be wha foodie heaven is like.  Everyone knows of Momofuku and everyone that I know, that has tried it, absolutely loves it.  I felt left out not having been there but that all changed after this last trip to NY.  On our last day there, with some time before having to be a the airport, we were deciding where to have lunch.  We realized this was not far and hoping we would get lucky and get a table we started walking there.Located inside the ""mall"", we made our way to the third floor were the restaurant is.  We could see it was busy but, luck was on our side and we got the last 2 spots at the bar. Immediately we were served water, given the drinks menu, and they explained how the ordering process goes, including the specials being advertised in a revolving board.  The drinks are fun, and with great presentation but the food is what really makes this place so special.  Just with their ramen bowls alone Momofuku would be outstanding but they added more.  Bao Buns that are loaded with either shrimp, mushrooms, or a daily selection.  We go the mushroom, 2 per order, and absolutely loved them.They also have kimchi, scallops, rice cakes, side vegetables/ salads.  OPne of their specials was the  crispy Brussels sprouts.  The combination of flavors on this dish  was amazing.  And then came the Ramen.  We ordered the spicy beef, and the smoky pork.  The spicy one was not super spicy, but they have a chili oil they can bring to you, on the side if you need an extra kick.  Both were excellent and they proved why Momofuku is so famous and loved by so many.For sure going again when back in NY!",0

17445,"I had the chance to visit Mee's Noodle Shop for lunch on New Years day. After moving to Hell's Kitchen I've walked by this place numerous times to and from work, but have never taken the chance to try dine here. After my girlfriend and I decided we wanted to try something totally new on the first day of the year this spot instantly popped into my mind. We made the choice to have it as our first restaurant experience of the new year and all I can say is that I wish I would've come sooner!We arrived around 3:30 in the afternoon and the place was pretty quiet. I contribute this to it being New Years day but it most likely is always like this during the off work hours. During evenings most nights I'll witness that this place is pretty packed. I'd recommend coming before the rush, or later in the evening to guarantee a table.We were able to choose our table and a server gave us menu's to look over after we sat down. This place has A LOT of options. There's a variety of set dishes and also a ""make your own"" noodle dish option. I ended up going with that a chose a ramen noodle with chicken bone broth and shredded beef. The portion was HUGE and the dish overall was extremely savory. Best part was that it was less than $8!The restaurant itself is basic in terms of decorations. They have set tables and some high chair seating towards their front facing windows. They also offer bench seating along their south wall with pillows on it. We sat there and really enjoyed it given it was a little more private than sitting in the middle of the restaurant.I'd recommend this place for a cheap noodle option in Hell's Kitchen that's guaranteed to fill you up. The servers here were also efficient with made for a pleasant experience. Definitely give Mee's Noodles a try if you're in the neighborhood!",0

I did spend $20 on a single patty burger, fries and a soda so it was VERY pricey for what I got but the food was very filling, and the service was wonderful and fast.The burger looked wonderful, the bun was amazing and the ingredients felt fresh. I added an egg and it was runny, just the way I like them!! The patty though didnt feel very flavorful. My friends got chicken tenders and said they were fantastic.The FRIES were to die for! And the soda fountain had Maine Root sodas which are a personal favorite. My boyfriend and I love them!",0
10078,"Jing Fong offers a classic cart service dim sum experience that is well worth the visit. Although weekends can see long waits, with up to 45 minutes for a table, choosing a weekday visit can save you time while still offering the bustling atmosphere. The restaurant's size is impressive for NYC, and they boast an excellent weekday special where dishes are uniformly priced at $3.75, a great bargain considering the quality.

The menu selection did not disappoint. The Tofu-hua was pleasantly warm and subtly sweet, a delightful surprise to someone who’s not typically a fan of the dish. The creativity shone through with the carrot-shaped fried dough filled with lotus paste—a personal favorite. Classic offerings such as Wu gak, Siu Mai, Ha gao, spare ribs, and chicken feet met expectations, maintaining a consistently good standard.

As Cantonese speakers, we found the service to be very amiable, though it should be noted that the staff's English may be limited, which is not a reflection of their intentions. Overall, Jing Fong stands out as a go-to spot for a satisfying dim sum experience in the heart of NYC.",1
15485,"Title: A Hearty Recommendation for a Comfort Food Haven

I recently had the pleasure of dining at a gem of a spot during Elite week, having come along as a plus one. As a solo diner, I was immediately put at ease by the excellent service; the attentive staff helped navigate the menu to cater to my sensitive stomach.

The star of the meal was undoubtedly the bacon fried chicken melt – a harmonious blend of savory and sweet with an inviting crunch from the toasted bread. Accompanied by a refreshing strawberry lemonade, it was a meal that truly hit the spot. Although I initially requested a side of honey to spice things up, a tiny taste revealed it was a bit too fiery for me. However, for those who revel in a spicy kick, this addition would be perfect!

The restaurant provides takeout service and is conveniently accessible via bus or the 4/5/6/Q/R trains, making it an easy stop for anyone on the go. While I didn't have the need to use the bathroom or WiFi, the lack of a strict dress code added to the relaxed ambiance.

Bottom line: Do yourself a favor and visit this establishment to partake in the goodness they're serving up. And a tip for the daring: add that honey for an adventurous zing!",1

Additionally, if you're not familiar with Pulsd (a discount/promo website for restaurants & activities), then search it and sign up to receive their promo emails.My friend and I were in the area for a charity walk and in the past, had some difficulty finding a good brunch spot. Since the walk has always been in Foley Square, I did some homework weeks before to find a good Sunday brunch in this vicinity. I looked on Pulsd and voila!  Bottomless cocktails brunch deal for 2 at Monk McGinn's for only $39. This included a main entree and a wide cocktail selection--unlimited for 90 minutes. Mimosa, Bloody Mary, Aperol Spritz, French 75, Punch tea were the options.When we arrived, the pub couldn't be more cozy in terms of atmosphere. Monk McGinn's was decorated all the way for Christmas. So many lights and wreaths adorned the restaurant and it looked so charming.Most, if not all tables were high top which meant whoever sat on the stools, it would be the backless kind.The waitress wasted no time in taking our drink order. I was addicted to their delicious Aperol Spritz the entire time, while my friend savored the Bloody Mary.The brunch menu had some really good choices and it was a bit difficult to decide. We both chose the seafood frittata which included shrimp, crabmeat and lobster although I don't recall tasting much lobster.As we enjoyed our cocktails (and yes, your 90 minutes is precisely timed) we eagerly waited for our frittata since we felt hungry. And we waited. And still waited.We both agreed that it was the longest wait in our experience. The waiter, who finally brought over our meals,  mentioned they had to tend to a very large group.The seafood frittata was quite good, served with one slice of toast. I would have liked a teeny salad to accompany the frittata, but it was served solo.After spending more than 90 minutes at Monk McGinn's, my friend and I agreed we'd like to return for dinner and/or HH (lasts until 8 p.m. during the week).I really enjoyed everything about Monk McGinn's and definitely plan to return. Winner!!",0
3249,"This is a relatively new place that opened up recently. They have a great lunch special that is totally worth a visit if you're in the area. You get to choose one appetizer and one entree starting at only $9.99. I had the Thai salad and drunken noodles with chicken. My friend tried the chicken gyoza and red curry with chicken. All of the food was tasty and served quickly and efficiently. Also, they really do mean it when they say that spicy is actually spicy!There are other good Thai places in the Murray Hill area (including BKK, Lan Larb, and Maison Thai) but this is also worth adding to the list. And after reading other Yelp reviews, I definitely have to try their delivery service.Huge plus: BYOB!",0
13607,"Title: A Delicious Foray into Ethiopian Cuisine at [Restaurant Name]

My family and I recently ventured into [Restaurant Name] for my inaugural Ethiopian dining experience. Initially uncertain of what to expect, I was intrigued by the meat sampler option which seemed like a perfect introduction, offering a mix of two meat and two vegetarian dishes.

The doro wat, a standout recommendation from the menu, lived well up to its hype, with its tender chicken falling right off the bone. I paired this with the beg alicha, a mild and flavorful lamb preparation that complemented the chicken dish beautifully. For the vegetarian side, the misir wat offered a bold, spicy kick from the lentils, while the beet and carrot dish balanced the plate with its sweet and earthy tones.

My sister opted for the awash chicken and regular lentils, relishing the rich flavors, while my husband enjoyed the sizzling beef tibs paired with a comforting chickpea dish. A highlight for all of us was the Injera, the traditional Ethiopian rolled bread, which proved to be the perfect utensil for scooping up every last delectable bite. The restaurant was generous enough to serve extra Injera, which we all appreciated.

Overall, [Restaurant Name] presented us with a delightful array of tastes and textures, serving up an authentic and memorable Ethiopian culinary adventure. I left with my curiosity transformed into a newfound appreciation for an incredibly rich and diverse cuisine.",1
17022,"Title: High Hopes Dashed by Subpar Seafood and Service

I wanted to love my recent Sunday night dinner at this seafood spot, but unfortunately, the experience didn't live up to expectations. Despite a reasonable wait time of less than 20 minutes for a party of three, the meal itself was a letdown.

We began with an array of starters: the fried calamari, crab sliders, and gumbo. The calamari was disappointingly dry, and while the crab sliders were passable, the gumbo was notably bland. Moving on to the main courses, I opted for the lobster combo with crawfish and shared crab legs with the table. While the crab legs were tasty, the lobster left a lot to be desired; it had an off taste that later resulted in a suspected case of food poisoning. The side dishes were a mixed bag as well—the mac and cheese was dry, although the garlic bread and fries were enjoyable.

Service was another area that fell short. Our busboy was the highlight with his diligent table maintenance and attentive nature. In contrast, our waitress seemed to lack focus on our needs. Additionally, we celebrated a friend's birthday with our own cake, which incurred a reasonable $2 per person cutting fee.

It's important to note this restaurant is cash-only, which led to an unfortunate mishap with their ATM. Restricted to withdrawals of $200, I needed $260 and ended up with duplicate $200 transactions plus a $60 one. The result was an overcharge, which required a couple of days to resolve with my bank after an error by the establishment's ATM.

In summary, the experience was marred by inconsistent food quality, variable service, and a payment snafu that left a bad taste.",1
16990,Small cash-only ramen shop in Alphabet City. I would not recommend it. The broth is salty but also bland at the same time with very little umami. Their noodles also tasted reheated. There are tons of ramen places in the city; don't waste a meal on Minca.,0
13286,"Omg I am so glad my friend wanted to come here because I would've never have found this gem. I can't have dairy anymore (why don't you think I wouldn't have come?? Lol) but mannnnnn this place was so accommodating when I mentioned my dairy concerns. The gentleman made sure there wouldn't be any cross contamination and had a special sauce that ensured no dairy was coming on my pizza. HOW FREAKIN SWEET. Another friend saw that I checked in on Yelp and told me to get the Bee Sting so I asked to get that with no cheese and they did it for me. SO FREAKIN GOOD. Pizza on pineapples is so last decade. But HONEY ON PIZZA, I mean, that's the vibe we're doing 2020. It was delicious! Hands down coming here again. And you should, too!",0
19324,"As someone who typically leans towards meat-centric dishes, I was initially skeptical about sampling vegan Chinese cuisine. However, my recent dining experience at this establishment completely shattered my reservations. Each bite of their savory delights, particularly the vegetable wonton drenched in their signature chili oil—a complex blend of imported Chinese ingredients—was a revelation, proving that one doesn't need meat to enjoy classic flavors. The dan dan noodles stood out, striking the perfect balance of taste and texture. To complement the meal, the potent and delightful drinks were the cherry on top. Kudos to the culinary team for crafting such an authentic and satisfying vegan fare that gives traditional Kung pao chicken a run for its money.

The atmosphere is casual and unpretentious, with just a few stools dotting the space. The menu is delightfully simple: you're choosing between pizza and a salad – that's it. But oh, the pizza! It's a showcase of freshness, with the tastiest cheese and sauce combination I've had in ages. Beverage options stick to the basics with fountain and canned sodas. If you're looking for a no-frills spot with excellent pizza, this is it.",1

We opted for the $18 lunch special which included 3 MONSTER gourmet tacos, a soup or salad and a coffee or tea. Soup was also so, so, so good--- Mexican ""squash soup"" he called it? Comes with fresh avocado, cheese, tortilla chips and sour cream as garnish. Was divine. Service was also amazing and our waiter was super informative and attentive. Will come here again, and how great is it that they take reservations? See you again soon La Contenta, I definitely ate to my heart's content.",0

14353,"Title: A Bite of Brunch Bustle at Community

If you're planning to tackle the weekend brunch scene near Columbia, brace yourself for the rush at Community. This popular haunt becomes quite the hotspot, so an early arrival—think 15 minutes before doors open—is essential unless you're game for a lengthy wait. Its status as a 'real' dining venue in the vicinity makes it the go-to for anyone craving an elevated meal experience, overshadowing its neighbor, Le Monde, which unfairly, in my opinion, holds a less stellar rep.

I zeroed in on the blueberry pancakes, acting on a tip from a Columbia insider. Priced at $15 pre-taxes and tip, they didn't disappoint. Almost top of the charts, these pancakes were a close second to the ones I've savored at Clinton Street Bakery. 

While Community didn't give me much more to muse on, the blueberry pancakes alone are enough to understand its local appeal. If you can beat the crowds, it's worth the visit.",1
15839,I come here way to often the be honest LOL.I came here a month ago to try the sushi doughnut I was late but I wanted to hop on the hype wagon. I walked in expecting it to be hype but I was blown away it's actually really good!!I also recommend the nachos it's a great little snack. I do wish that I was a little more saucier sometimes but it's still good.I made my own poke bowl and everyone is super friendly and they have Tako. I have rarely seen it at other poke places. The sucky thing is they have a limited amount of it so you have to order pretty early on and you have to come in because it isn't listed online.I also love how they do special catch of the day so you can try new things and don't get sick of the dishes,0
15974,"When I first walked in it was completely empty so I was instantly greeted by the waitress. She was very friendly. While dining it a few other people trickled in but I still received great service. I ordered the veggie samosas and they were very hearty. The sauces that  came on the side were great for dipping and the variety of flavors as well, They come in a pair and with the garlic naan on the side was a great lunch for me. I wasn't even able to eat everything and took it for later to eat. I didn't feel heavy or tired but very satisfied.",0
14996,"Finally an all you can eat veggies/tofu shabu in Manhattan. You will pay extra for meat dishes but you can share the meat dishes with people. I went with 2 other friends and we shared 2 meat dishes. They have all you can eat dumplings, tofu, noodles and veggies. The broth is pretty good but I think the sauce selection is a little small. The bill comes out about 35 per person.  There are definitely better all you can eat hotpot in the city but this place is the first one so close to ktown that's all you can eat veggies. It feels pretty healthy coming here knowing you can eat all the vegetables. Staffs are a little slow on filling soups for us. Overall, a good experience but with the price point I think it's better off to just go to a completely all you can eat hotpot place.",0

We started with the mac and cheese tomato soup dumplings wrapped in bacon. DELISH! Then, we moved onto a refreshing kale apple salad.

They have a prefixed menu and you do not need to tip, cause it already included. I tried beef tartar, it was lacking some seasoning, but overall the I'm at was cash with a nice presentation. My husband got calamari I would say they were better seasoned. For the second course, I got a lamb dish, highly recommend, soft medium rear piece, seasoned beautifully, garnished with grilled veggies. My husband got tuna, which they overcooked and instead of medium-rare, he got medium to well- done piece. Disappointing for such should be the perfect place. After dinner, they offer some cheese selection to try. The desserts were outstanding, even though our waiter almost forgot about our tea/coffee, we still had a good time.I doubt that I will come back to this place, New York has so much to offer and even better places. For the price you pay, you will get solid service with good ( but not great) food.",0
20155,"Came here for an early dinner on Friday evening around 6, was able to be seated right away and about half the tables were open. We started out by sharing the crab soup dumplings, I was a little surprised there were only 6 of them, but the flavor was great and given the size of our entrees having 3 each was a perfect appetizer. The crab was very flavorful and the mild soup complemented it nicely. For my entree I had the sautéed chicken with hot chili, which was delicious. It was quite similar to most Szechuan peppercorn chicken dishes I've had throughout the city, except the spice was certainly on the milder side. The dry chili added a different twist to the dish and went very nicely with the peanuts. If the level of spice is often an issue for your enjoyment of Szechuan peppercorn dishes is highly recommend this one. They do give a 4% discount if you use cash, but the surcharge for using a credit card shows up on your bill either way so be sure to look at your bill carefully if you're trying to use that discount. Overall I'd definitely recommend checking this place out, it has a nice variety of options and service was fairly quick.",0

My recent visit to [Restaurant Name] was a delightful surprise. Upon arrival on a bustling Sunday at noon, we were promptly seated without the need for a reservation, instantly creating a welcoming atmosphere. The service commenced with a thoughtful touch - complimentary hot tea alongside refreshing waters.

The starter, pork summer roll priced at $4.50 for a pair, was a refreshing preamble to our meal. Served with a unique sweet and tangy vinegar-based sauce, it set a high expectation for the mains. The pho, both beef and chicken versions, did not disappoint. At an affordable $7.25 each, the bowls were brimming with generous portions of meats and vegetables, enhanced by a side of crisp bean sprouts and aromatic fresh herbs. The quality and quantity provided exceptional value, ensuring a satisfying and hearty meal.

Efficiency didn’t fall by the wayside, with the service being notably swift. The cleanliness of the recently renovated restrooms downstairs reinforced the establishment's attention to detail.

In summary, [Restaurant Name] delivers on all fronts: prompt service, quality eats, and remarkable value. It’s an establishment I’d recommend to anyone looking for a filling, flavorsome meal at an affordable price.",1

The menu offers some commendable dishes, with the grilled calamari standing out for its flavor and perfect preparation. However, the lemon sole did tip towards the saltier side, which was a minor blip in an otherwise enjoyable meal. The experience was sweetly rounded off with a tiramisu that was simply divine—truly the perfect ending to our dining experience. 

Overall, [Restaurant Name] provides a lovely setting for friends to gather and enjoy a meal where the food is generally very decent and the atmosphere is especially inviting.",1
1404,"With the pressures of Valentine's Day to create a perfect night, I figured Brazilian AYCE cuisine would definitely be an impressive choice. Our reservation was taken promptly and we were escorted downstairs to the massive dining floor. Being that it was our first time, our preliminary server gave us a rundown of how the Fogo de Chão system works and what we would expect over the course of the next hour or so. To start, we were given a basket of what looked like plain old dinner rolls. I noticed that they didn't supply us with any butter or spreads, meaning it was meant to be enjoyed alone. I took a bite into the soft bread rolls and to my surprise, my tastebuds were met with a soft and cheesy filling. These Fogo de Chão rolls were a huge hit of the night. Once we flipped our ""heart"" signs to the green side, the servers started pouring in. We were offered pork ribs, lamb, top sirloin, chicken, pork sausage and other prime cuts of meats. Everything was delicious and filling. If you need a break from all the meat, they have an amazing salad and cured meats bar that is buffet-style. Towards the end of the meal, they come around with a liquor cart and dessert menu. We enjoyed some red ice wine and the molten chocolate cake. The whole experience was a great pleasure, and worth the pretty penny.",0

My beef udon required constant hydration to offset the salt overload, and my friend's crab egg dish was a letdown with its imitation crab, despite claims of authenticity. My advice would be to skip this spot unless options are scarce.",1
361,"Title: A Lackluster Experience at Telio

My recent visit to Telio was unfortunately disappointing. The prices were excessive, with a simple house salad and chicken soaring over $20 and appetizers exceeding $15. This set the tone for a less-than-stellar dining experience where I felt constrained in my choices, fearing the regret of an unsatisfactory meal at a high cost.

I settled on the chicken kebab with vegetables, trading in rice for a side of grilled veggies. While they served two kebabs, I would have preferred the option of a single skewer at a lower price to allow for more variety without the financial stretch. The food quality did not help justify the costs; the tzatziki sauce was reminiscent of cream cheese, and by 7:30 PM they had already run out of lamb and pork.

Service compounded the issue, beginning with a 25-minute wait to place our order in a half-empty restaurant. Interaction with our waitress was minimal and unenthusiastic, and the concept of dessert was a distant dream as we were never offered any. In the end, we had to actively seek someone to provide our check.

I cannot recommend Telio, nor do I have any intentions of returning. The combination of exorbitant prices, mediocre food, and poor service makes for an experience that's easy to skip.",1
10996,"Title: ""No-Frills Delight at the Modern Handroll Haven""

If you're a sushi enthusiast craving a straightforward, high-quality dining experience, this no-tipping, bar-seated handroll spot is a gem worth visiting. The ambiance is refreshingly minimalistic—modern and efficient, with the focus rightly placed on the cuisine. Patrons are encouraged to select their rolls prior to seating, which streamlines service and adds to the efficiency.

I indulged in a 5-handroll set featuring toro, yellowtail, bay scallops, crab, and lobster at a reasonable $24, all inclusive of tip. The meal was satisfying, striking the right balance—not overwhelming yet pleasantly filling over time. The stars of the set were the toro and yellowtail, their flavors shining through unadorned and pure, while the lobster and crab were enjoyable albeit slightly heavy-handed with mayo.

However, the bay scallops handroll fell short of expectations, unfortunately smothered in kewpie mayo, which masked the delicate taste of the scallops. On the upside, the sushi rice was noteworthy, enhanced with just the right hint of sweet rice vinegar.

Upon expressing my thoughts on the scallop experience, the waitress helpfully informed me that substitutions were allowed—a tip future diners can use to tailor their meal to perfection. Next time, I'll be swapping the bay scallops for salmon. All in all, this spot is a must-visit for handroll aficionados looking for a no-fuss, quality meal at a decent price point.",1
1323,"Good food with a fun New York style entertainment. The lounge singer sounded just like Frank Sinatra. I thought it was expensive for the meal but hey, we're in the heart of Time Square and it's New Years. We hit the roasted chicken with carrots and fingerling potatoes. They included a mash of fresh herbs grown on sight, mixed in olive oil. It was delicious on everything.",0
20865,"So my family went to a memorial service and were looking for a restaurant on restaurant week and found rotisserie georgette. We walked over 10 avenues to get here and it was well worth it!Walking up to Rotisserie Georgette the restaurant looks impressive, going inside the restaurant the beautiful experience continues with great ambiance and decor. The host was prompt and got us seated to our reserved table right away which was appreciated. The server was extremely courteous and even gave suggestions to us that were very helpful. Myself and my sister ordered the salad for appetizer and my father ordered the chilled corn soup. The size of the salad was huge! They didnt skimp for restaurant week which we loved since we were starving and the salad was delicious especially the candied nuts. My father also raved about his soup as being very refreshing. They then came to clear all the plates and utensils and even put napkins on our laps.For the main course the three of us had the house special the rotisserie chicken and my mom had the mussels. I was so hungry I forgot a picture but the chicken was finger licking good and so moist and flavorful. This chicken was not missing seasoning! Probably hands down one of the best chicken I have ever had and I eat alot of chicken. My mother also loved the mussels in red sauce.Lastly was dessert we all enjoyed our desserts. I can only remember my apricot tart and both the tart and ice cream were on point. If I'm in the area again I'll be back!",0
20579,"Title: A Veggie Lover's Delight with a Spicy Twist

I recently revisited one of my favorite NYC spots and it remains a top choice for anyone with a penchant for vegetarian Mexican cuisine. The vegetarian verde enchiladas are a standout, bursting with flavor and just the right amount of zest. The ensalada playita is a refreshing counterpart, while the guacamole is classic and perfectly executed.

I was impressed to discover they can adapt the ceviche to be vegetarian, a creative and much-appreciated touch. However, there's a slight letdown for vegetarians looking for broader options, as my request to substitute black beans for octopus in the tostadas was turned down. More vegetarian-friendly entrees would be a welcome enhancement to their already delightful menu.

The habanero grapefruit margarita is a fiery treasure for those who dare, though it might be too hot to handle for some. For a milder kick without compromising on taste, the jalapeño grapefruit margarita is an excellent alternative.

Despite a few limitations, the quality of the dishes on offer means I can't stay away for long. This restaurant undeniably warrants a return visit, and I am already looking forward to my next meal there. 100% will be back!",1
14487,"This is a good, but not great Thai place. Physically, it is a cozy cafe with very basic decor. We shared several dishes from here: beef noodle soup, pad kee mao, red curry, and more. The portion sizes of everything were decent. However, the flavor of all the dishes was slightly blander than they should have been. I am not sure if it was purposely toned down or if they just don't know how they make it. For a better Thai place, I recommend Jasmine Thai a couple doors down, which has been there for decades and has a more authentic taste.",0
10835,"Well gotta say New York doesn't have mexican cuisine down. The margarita was a step above yesterday's but nothing like we get in California. Sangria was yummy!For food the guacamole was an ""a"" plus, the tacos reminded me of Taco Bell. We enjoyed but not authentic.",0

The rice, beans, sweet plantains, and pernil were delightful, and the beef empanada was a perfect complement to the meal. Generous portions coupled with authentic flavors make this spot a definite go-to for future lunch plans. It's also an excellent choice for takeout. Highly recommended!",1
214,"Title: Cozy Dive with a Sake Twist

Do not let the dive-like vibe of this basement bar fool you; while the atmosphere is unpretentious, the prices are not your typical dive bar rates. Be sure to have your ID handy; this place strictly enforces the 21+ policy.

The space is small and dimly lit, which could be an issue for those with a fear of cramped spaces (claustrophobia). Expect to get cozy with your neighbors, as the seating is quite tight—large groups beware; six people should be your max.

If you're here for drinks, you'll be pleased with the extensive selection of sake and shochu, though don't look for any vodka or whiskey. The food is decent and won't break the bank, but it's mostly microwaved fare, so set your culinary expectations accordingly.

The service leaves something to be desired; it can be pushy and brusque, with instances of rushed or even rude behavior. One waitress was seen taking a glass with sake still in it from guests, which felt a bit too keen to turn tables.

In summary, this spot is a quirky destination for a drink and a casual bite, but be prepared for tight quarters and service that might not always hit the mark.",1
192,"I came here after a night of drinking at As-Is.I usually always look for the most interesting item on the menu, even if it costs a little more.  In a city of so much averageness, I try to find unique gems.  I did not exactly find that here, but the food was still good.  I was sorta busy, but I didn't wait too long for my food and the service was good.They have a bunch of sandwich/fries/drink meals for $12.50, but I ended up getting the Smokin' Ace burger ($9.50) and a side of buffalo onion rings ($4.75).The Smokin' Ace comes with Grilled Onions, Smokin' Fries, Cheddar Cheese Sauce, and Lucky Sauce.  The burger was more or less your average greasy burger. Not bad, but nothing too rememberable. The buffalo onion rings came with a ton of buffalo sauce and a side of blue cheese.   I think they came with too much buffalo sauce, but were otherwise really good. I'd get these again without the buffalo sauce.",0
20068,"Title: A Shift in Concept at Ikinari Steak NY Left Me Longing for More

Having been tantalized by social media buzz around Ikinari Standing Steak in New York, my enthusiasm to experience this unique dining concept - consuming a delicious steak while standing - was met with an unexpected turn. Upon arriving, I learned that the once-standing-only establishment had succumbed to seated service due to customer feedback, much to my bewilderment.

Choosing your preferred cut and size from the butcher station remains a highlight, maintaining a hands-on approach to dining. The restaurant suggests opting for rare, allowing the residual heat from the plate to continue cooking the steak to perfection. However, the absence of any sauce left the steak somewhat wanting; personalization fell squarely on my shoulders to achieve the desired flavor profile.

The steak was passable, yet it was the dissipation of the original standing concept that truly marred the experience for me. It appears a trip to Japan might be in order to capture the authenticity that was lost in translation here in New York.",1
19428,"Been coming to this spot many times - very solid and consistent Chinese food. Great service and love the menu - every style I've tried (dry pot, picked Chile, garlic, dry pepper etc...) has been 10/10.

21126,"Title: Another Win for Sarabeth's

As a decade-long devotee of Sarabeth's, my expectations were high as I entered yet another of their establishments. True to form, the experience did not disappoint. The spacious and elegantly lit environment set the stage for a brunch that would once again affirm my fondness for the chain.

Straying from my usual preference for the goat cheese and smoked salmon omelette, I opted for the special: an omelette enriched with wild mushrooms, mozzarella, and a hint of truffle oil. The dish was a revelation – each bite delivering pure gastronomic delight that sent my satisfaction soaring.

My companion's choice of blueberry pancakes was equally impressive, with their fluffiness, rich flavor, and visually appealing presentation. Unfortunately, the accompanying muffin basket was merely passable, lacking the wow factor of the main dishes.

Service at Sarabeth's remains a benchmark, with staff who are both professional and attentive, enhancing the overall dining experience. This consistency across their locations could well explain the perpetual buzz and their well-deserved reputation.

In summary, Sarabeth's upholds its legacy - it's clear why their doors are always revolving with satisfied guests.",1
17495,I love the meatball shop. This weekend was my first time at this particular location. I didn't even realize that is was National Meatball Day. My cravings and the universe were aligned lol. The service here was great and so was the food. I ordered the Big Bowl. It comes with 6 juicy meatballs with classic tomato sauce over spaghetti. It was definitely more than enough to fill me up. I ended up having someLeftover. the meatballs here are perfectly seasoned and cooked and that's why I keep going back.,0
13789,"Title: A Pleasant Experience with Room for Culinary Improvement

I recently dined at this restaurant on a Friday afternoon and was pleased to award it 4 stars. The absence of a wait was a welcome start to a smooth lunch experience. The service shone, with a prompt and helpful waiter who assisted in my menu choices. I selected shrimp and chicken wings, accompanied by a side of truffle mac and cheese.

While the shrimp met expectations, the wings unfortunately missed the mark with a lackluster flavor. The truffle mac and cheese was mediocre, failing to impress my palate as I had hoped. On the upside, the drinks served here are of high quality and were the highlight of the meal.

Despite the culinary shortcomings, I'm drawn back by the overall positive experience and look forward to giving this spot another try on my next trip to NYC.",1
12235,"We booked a table at this quaint Indian restaurant for a Saturday evening and to our surprise, we had the place to ourselves. Among the trio of dishes we ordered—the chicken tikka masala stood out, delicious as always. Both the sag paneer and goat curry were enjoyable as well but couldn't surpass the chicken. The pricing felt reasonable for the generous portions provided, and the offer of unlimited rice was a delightful bonus. The ambiance was cozy and serene, setting the stage for a relaxed dining experience complemented by the attentive staff. This restaurant is a solid choice for anyone craving quality Indian cuisine.",1
1443,"Title: A Burrata Haven for Cheese Lovers

My friend and I, utterly obsessed with Burrata, were delighted to stumble upon this quaint pizza joint. Their signature Burrata pizza is a triumph of Sicilian style - a harmonious blend of exquisite flavors, especially when graced with the creamy burrata cheese. While the crust could have used a tad more toasting on our first visit, the slice itself was generously sized and satisfying.

Returning for a second taste, the Burrata pizza had reached perfection with a crispier crust that elevated the experience. The garlic knots were a garlicky delight, pairing wonderfully with the accompanying dipping sauce.

Venturing beyond our Burrata fixation, we indulged in the Chicken Bacon slice - a delectable combination that did not disappoint. While the menu isn't vast, it offers sufficient variety, including a nod to vegan options.

The ambiance is simple and unassuming, with a focus on quick, efficient service. For its reasonable prices and cozy setting, this spot is ideal for a casual yet delicious bite.",1
11694,"Every time I get korean fried chicken ($12) at a new restaurant, I'm just blown away, but I think Barn Joo is my favorite thus far. 5/5 for the chicken alone. This crispiness is seriously no joke. That batter is just WONDERFUL. Chicken is still ridiculously moist inside while the exterior is this slightly sweet crunch that had us getting two orders (with me eating the most, sorry not sorry). Truffle fries ($7): almost as good as the chicken wings, this was crazy crispy and full of truffle flavor!Uni bibimbap ($24) though - thank u next. It's gorgeous, and individually, the components are good, but together, nothing could've prepared me for that weird crunch/popping as I took spoonful after spoonful of the mixed result. Uni also didn't taste the freshest, and it deterred me from getting uni for a good while after eating here. Desserts: we pretty much ordered everything, but sadly, none of the dessert options grabbed my attention as it was all just mediocre tasting",0

If you're looking to satisfy an enormous appetite without breaking the bank, look no further! This restaurant is a true find. Their burger isn't just big; it's HUMUNGOUS, promising to challenge even the heartiest of eaters. The steak cut fries on the side are a hefty portion and taste delightful, though they do tip the scale towards the greasy side. While it might not become my go-to spot for every burger craving, it's the perfect spot for those times when my hunger is as giant as their servings.",1
20599,"I was seeing a play nearby and got an alert that El Pres gave this place a 9 for pizza. So I decided to have a very late lunch and was seated near the large open window overlooking the street (great for people watching especially since it was a beautiful Saturday). It was almost empty given the random time of day, but it has a good amount of space to accommodate busy times. Unfortunately they don't serve slices of pizza, only whole pies, and even for me that would've been too much. So I ordered the meatballs & cheesy garlic bread, and a lemonade. The lemonade was a bit too sweet but not bad. The meatballs were 4 large meatballs, covered in plenty of sauce and a couple dollops of ricotta on the side. The garlic bread was the best part--they didn't skimp on the cheese, and it was garlicky, buttery, cheesy, toasty goodness! The waitress was friendly to me & all the other patrons she spoke with, and I heard her enthusiastically talk about the specials during the week to some customers who seemed equally eager to come back. I want to come back too sometime so I can try the pizza!",0
19549,"This is my favorite place to come in the city just because of the vibes. There are tons of colorful lights and the music is great. The only downside is that it takes forever and a half to get you seated around dinner time, and there is often miscommunication regarding your wait time. I would highly recommend finding a seat at or around the bar, ordering a margarita pitcher, and asking for menus to eat right where you are. Also, be aware that there are often HUGE crowds at this restaurant and it can be difficult to move around, so I wouldn't make a stop here if you aren't into that. The staff here is super friendly, for the most part. The menu is great - it has plenty of options for everyone (appetizers, salads, mains and LOTS of drinks) and it includes an entire vegan section! For vegans they offer the same types of meals as the regular menu, just using dairy-free substitutes for everything. I came here with my two friends and we ordered 2 strawberry margarita pitchers (one pitcher would have been plenty though ) for $31 each, which isn't too bad. One friend got nachos, the other got chips & guac, and I got the mini quesadilla grande. We all loved our food and the margaritas were delicious. As always, I'll be back on my next trip to the city!",0
11118,"Title: A Fabulous Bite and Show in the Big Apple

I recently found my new favorite spot in New York City—a vibrant and uproarious drag show paired with unexpectedly delightful cuisine. From the moment you're seated, the experience begins with a drag queen gracefully taking your order. I savored a delectable veggie sandwich, packed with a garden's worth of fresh vegetables like eggplant, zucchini, and squash, all nestled between slices of sweet, tantalizing bread. The side of perfectly crispy, well-seasoned fries may just be the best I've ever had.

As for the show, it's a riot of laughter and engagement, with the performers energetically involving the audience. Though the service fell slightly short, with our waitress not embodying the vivacious spirit of her colleagues and being rather elusive for additional requests, the entertainment more than made up for this hiccup.

Do yourself a favor: book a reservation at this must-visit New York establishment. It's an experience that delivers both on the plate and the stage.",1
3339,"After lunch, I stopped by Sprinkles for the first time to see what all the fuss was about. After looking at all the options, I determined that the best choice were the minis sampler $5 for 3 cupcakes. I think the cupcakes were average. Very sweet icing. Nothing to write home and tell anyone about.The staff was very kind, explaining the different options, and being very patient with my indecisiveness. If you have a sweet tooth, these will suffice.",0
12277,"I visited this charming restaurant recently for lunch and came away impressed. The standout was my spaghetti pomodoro – a dish so flavorful and expertly seasoned, it had me savoring every bite. However, the portion could have been more generous; it left me wishing for a second helping, especially since no bread was provided, an unusual omission that might have rounded out the meal. Nonetheless, the quality of the pasta itself was undeniable. Adding to the positive experience, the service was attentive and friendly, and the location just perfect for a midday escape. Overall, despite the small portion, the exquisite taste made for a delightful lunch.",1

I've finally found ramen nirvana in the most unexpected of places! The spicy ramen bowl at this gem of a restaurant isn't your average scorch-your-tastebuds affair. Instead, it masterfully blends heat and flavor, thanks to a divine spicy sesame oil that complements the broth without drowning out its richness.

The perfectly al dente straight noodles were exceptional vessels, absorbing the savory goodness in every slurp. The bowl's composition truly deserves applause – a harmonious balance of noodle, broth, and toppings, with the pork char siu deserving a standing ovation for its contribution to the ensemble.

Efficient and warm service added to the experience, assuring this spot will be a compulsory visit each time I return from Chicago. I'm already longing for that next taste of this unforgettable spicy ramen bowl.",1
20530,"I popped into the restaurant for lunch and was pleased to find no wait for bar seating. My choice of the garlic chicken ramen turned out to be satisfactory - it was good, though it fell short of being exceptional. The noodles were commendably firm, however, the broth, while distinctly garlicky, was rather oily and lacked the extraordinary taste I had anticipated, especially given the Momofuku reputation.",1
1240,"Title: A Spanish Gem in Hudson Yards: Mercado Little Spain

If there's a singular beacon that draws me to Hudson Yards, it's unequivocally Mercado Little Spain. Nestled in the ground floor of this colossal complex, this vibrant food hall is a breath of Spanish exuberance in a rather lackluster development. 

Yes, indulgence here might tug at your purse strings, but affordable delights are scattered throughout for a wallet-friendly taste of Spain. Take, for example, the horchata stand – an utter revelation. They craft a version that vies for the title of the best I've ever savored, a testament to the overall exceptional offerings available.

Ironically, Mercado Little Spain outshines its surroundings with such vitality that one can't help but muse, why didn't they hand over the entire Hudson Yards reins to José Andrés? His touch seems to be the secret ingredient needed to awaken this slumbering retail giant.",1

14273,"Had a chance to hit Asiam while meeting clients nearby - this appears to be a family-owned business and may be closer to Indonesian than Thai but a bit hard to tell. The interior is pretty dark and I think there were about 10 or so tables. Service was slow for us (3 eating lunch with about 3 other tables) - 20-30 minutes for the food to hit the table. I'm not sure if this is a regular lunch thing but it surprised me as most of the food I've had in NYC had faster table turns.In total we ordered a spicy soup (a bit like Tom Yum), a shrimp Pad Thai and a tofu Pad See Ew - at least that's what I think it was - something else was actually ordered and after waiting so long my coworker just ate what showed up. I was looking forward to the Pad Thai but I'm not sure why it had glass noodles (like you find in Japchae) instead of the more common vermicelli-style flatter noodle - maybe that's an NYC thing? Not sure but it wasn't what I was expecting.On the other hand, the lunch was pretty cheap for NYC - my shrimp Pad Thai was $11.05 plus tip, so if you're interested in ""Asian"" food on the cheap this could be a fine destination. Otherwise I've had much better. The waiter was also the greeter and looked to be working by himself (I do think there was someone in the kitchen though so I'm not sure why the food took so long).",0
17024,"Title: A Delight for Spice Lovers at the Local Curry House

I recently had the pleasure of dining at this gem of a restaurant and the experience was nothing short of delightful. We were famished upon arrival and, much to our delight, the service was swift. The portions served were generous and came as a pleasant surprise, particularly the pork curry rice, which, contrary to my expectation of scant meat bits, was laden with hefty slices of pork.

Be warned: 'extra spicy' is not to be taken lightly here. The pork was thoroughly soaked in a fiery curry sauce that packed a punch, proving too much for my spice tolerance. Thankfully, the side of pork cutlets provided a delicious and milder alternative to enjoy. Each meal was complemented with a refreshing side of radish and a comforting bowl of miso soup.

For those with milder palates, the chicken cutlet with 'medium spicy' curry rice offers just the right amount of zing without overwhelming the senses.

I am thoroughly impressed and find myself longing for a place of equal caliber in Seattle. This restaurant is a must-visit for anyone craving authentic and flavorful curry dishes. A hearty thumbs up for the curry connoisseurs out there!",1

During a recent family trip to NYC, we dined at a conveniently located restaurant near our hotel. The service was a highlight, with a friendly wait staff that was attentive to our needs.

The menu was diverse enough to cater to both adults and children, which led us to try the white pizza for the kids, fried calamari, shrimp with pasta, and lasagna. While the offerings were generally satisfactory, they didn't quite hit the mark in terms of flavor - the food was decent but didn't stand out, and the calamari was notably chewy, which detracted from our experience.

Considering the wealth of dining options available in the city, we find ourselves inclined to explore other venues on our next visit rather than returning.",1
3405,Restautant week started this week and Milos was my first stop. Milos is a extremely expensive restaurant so the $26 for two course or $32 for three course is very well worth it. They serve items that are off their regular menu. Normal prices for apps tange from $35 to $49. Salads in the $22 range. Entrees are either market price or range from $55 to $100. I highly suggest to get the Octopus and Dorado. The octopus is grilled perfectly and tender. The Dorado they give you a whole fish simply grilled. It is really good and definitely can taste the freshness(fish are overnight delivered from Greece). The Dorado alone makes the $32 prix fixe well worth it. The other entree Salmon Tartare was good but it was too salty. Thr side of fries was good but they were small tiny pieces so small you couldn't even call them shoestring fries. To finish off I highly suggest the Greek yogurt. Its smooth creamy and delicious.,0

Don't let the modest exterior fool you; this restaurant is a revelation for Vietnamese cuisine lovers.

The thin crust was crispy just perfectly and the amount of margarita sauce and cheese ratio was perfect. Sprinkle some pepper flakes and you definitely get a kick.,0
17545,"I was pretty excited to try Benemon due to the high volume of positive reviews. However I was sorely disappointed that the first thing I noticed when I walked into the restaurant was the distractingly horrible odor surrounding the whole establishment . The space itself was very small so the overwhelming smell of old oil and body odor really filled the space. I'm not sure if that is how it smells in there all the time but I truly hope not (this review is also from January so I'm not sure if they cleaned up since then). It was also weird how walking into the bathroom had a better smell to it than the actual restaurant (thanks to a small air freshener in the corner ). As stated above the space itself is pretty small and so they can't seat a lot of people and it does get crowded fairly easily and they don't take reservations so if you want to guarantee yourself seating make sure to enter early. My friend and I entered on a Sunday night at 7 PM and thankfully were able to be seated right away. We decided to order a couple dishes to share: -TUNA TATAKI: Great flavor and a great appetizer -Salty Pork Belly: a bit on the oily side but flavor wise was great and a nice amount of fat. A bit too heavy for my taste. -Una Tama Don: Great quality of eel - a slightly steeper price but not too bad. All in all, though the food itself was great I don't think I will be finding myself back just due to the air quality and upkeep of the restaurant which was very disappointing.",0
18171,"Upon visiting the restaurant highlighted by rave reviews, I found they indeed serve an intriguing mix of traditional Indian and Indo-Chinese fusion dishes. The ambiance struck a chic note, complemented by attentive service. Culinary delights were aplenty; each dish was seasoned to perfection, avoiding the common pitfall of excessive saltiness that often plagues Indian cuisine elsewhere. While the portion sizes were modest, they proved ample for sharing between two. Our meal comprised a pair of appetizers, a succulent lamb entrée, and concluded with a flan dessert, which admittedly fell short of expectations due to its uncharacteristically dense texture.

I'm giving Angel of Harlem a well-deserved five stars for their electrifying Sunday brunch experience! The southern/Caribbean-inspired menu is a treat, especially for someone of Jamaican roots like myself. The french toast is simply divine—a must-try that's as delectable as advertised. Add to that the bottomless sangria, which is not only delicious but packs a pleasant punch.

What takes the brunch to the next level is the atmosphere—the DJ is absolutely on fire, skillfully blending tracks that make you want to dance between mouthfuls. It's the perfect blend of a good meal and a good time in Harlem.

The staff deserves applause too; their energy and enthusiasm are infectious. You'll be tempted to invite them to join your table for a laugh and a drink if only they weren't working. Remember to book your spot if you're planning on hitting it up on a Sunday. Your table has a two-hour limit, so plan to make the most of your feasting and dancing during that window. Don't miss out—Angel of Harlem is a spot you've got to experience!",1
10387,"Taiwan Bear House stands out as a charming bubble tea oasis, offering a delightful range of options from the classic taro milk tea to an array of fruity concoctions that are sure to satisfy any palate. The pricing is on par with your average tea spot, but the quality of their beverages truly stands above, striking a perfect balance between flavor and refreshment. The interior exudes warmth and coziness, complemented by a beautifully crafted exterior that beckons you inside. Conveniently nestled beside Joe's Shanghai, it's a prime spot to cap off a delectable Dim Sum feast with a refreshing dessert drink.

17775,"Came here with a few colleagues on Friday and little and my oh my everyone loved the food. Full of flavor. Everyone ordered different items on the menu and loved their choices. This is similar to chipotle where you are able to selection ingredients in your dish. You can choose rice, lentils, and salads and your protein and veggies.",0
16628,"Title: A Hidden Gem with Comfort and Flavor

By pure chance, I discovered an incredible dining spot that I can't wait to visit again. Upon arrival without a reservation, we were promptly seated, much to our delight. The unique charm of the restaurant is evident with its kitchen operating out of what appears to be a chic van, adding to the quirky ambiance.

Comfort is key here, with bar chairs designed like mini-couches, complete with back support and plush cushions that make you feel at home. The drink menu did not disappoint either; the ""Tsunami"" I ordered was a potent concoction that lived up to its name.

As for the food, it was nothing short of spectacular. The pork belly dish was mouthwateringly succulent, and the blackened fish was so perfectly seasoned that each bite left us craving the next. Every dish was packed with flavors that danced on the palate and left us completely satisfied, yet somehow still longing for more.

An added bonus is their happy hour schedule, which caters to both early birds and night owls, available from 11 pm to 2 am. This spot has won my palate, and I'm already planning my next visit. A definite must-try for anyone looking for a meal that's as comfortable as it is flavorful.",1
10150,"Title: A Ukrainian Gem in the Heart of New York

If you find yourself wandering the streets of New York with a rumbling stomach, make your way to this cozy Ukrainian Diner and Restaurant. Don't be deceived by its compact space; the bustling kitchen upfront and additional seating in the back promise a place for everyone, especially during brunch hours.

As you step inside, let the wafting aromas of home-style cooking tempt you to order the entire menu. Beginning with the Borscht soup, you'll instantly understand why - it's nothing short of amazing. For the main course, the hearty goulash paired with smooth mashed potatoes and a selection of mixed pierogies deliver comfort on a plate. The smoked salmon eggs benedict, resting on a bed of crispy hash browns, is an absolute must-try. Each mouthful is a delightful blend of flavors that will have you planning your next visit before you've even left.

Whether you're a first-time visitor or a seasoned regular, this Ukrainian spot is a culinary treasure that shouldn't be missed. You're not just getting a meal; you're getting an experience. Will definitely be back for more!",1

16791,"Title: Underwhelming Experience at a Premium Price

My friends and I recently visited an upscale restaurant, enticed by the promise of their renowned Hida Sukiyaki beef course. Expectations were high, but unfortunately, the experience didn’t live up to the hype.

Firstly, the prices were steep. For a group of four sharing two Sukiyaki courses and a few a la carte items, the bill soared to an eye-watering $500. While the service was commendable, it did little to justify the cost.

Taste-wise, the dishes were satisfactory – some were quite enjoyable, in fact – but none delivered the culinary fireworks we'd hoped for, especially at that price point. Not to mention, the Sukiyaki portions were disappointingly scant, leaving us feeling far from satiated.

Wrapping up, our visit was marked by a sense of disillusionment. With each of us lighter by over $100 and our appetites not fully quenched, it's hard to see the value. It's unlikely we'll return or recommend this establishment for those seeking a memorable dining adventure.",1
11363,"Title: Authentic Chinese Fare at a Steal

I had the pleasure of visiting a no-frills Chinese eatery that boasts incredibly priced lunch deals ranging from $7 to $8, which, to my delight, included Peking Duck! It's essential to note that timing is key here—arrive early because their sumptuous offerings tend to run out within an hour. Post 2 PM, the establishment transitions into a bakery. A word to the wise: savor your meal while it's hot for the best experience, as the dishes can lose their appeal as they cool down.",1
15234,"Umberto's is a remnant of an era gone by in Little Italy. The restaurant itself is steeped in NYC & specifically NYC Mafia history. As most people know, Little Italy is something of a shell of its former self. Changing demographics, pricing, and movement to Long Island & the Jersey suburbs have left only a few remnants of what used to be a thriving Italian American neighborhood. Umberto's is a very well known restaurant and as such there are quite a few Karens from Paducah there (tourists), but there are also quite a few locals who still visit the place. The food is fantastic. The bread & oil is great. The calamari is perfectly fried & not at all chewy & the red sauce it comes with is well seasoned with a nice spice to it. One thing I enjoyed about this place is they give you options with your pasta and sauce. I got the chicken parm with spaghetti in olive oil & garlic. Really good. Not the best ever, but right there in the discussion. The service is friendly, and for me at least, they were not at all pushy or rude. Surprisingly the prices were reasonable for a place in Manhattan that draws a fair share of tourists. A lot of tourist favorites are hit or miss. This one is a hit for me.",0
19991,"Food: 3/5Ordered Kumamoto oysters, lobster bisque and two medium rare prime sirloins. The oysters (5/5) were fantastic. Super fresh and sweet! The lobster bisque (2.5/5) was just ok. I prefer my soup to be hot and it was lukewarm. It also wasn't creamy enough for my preference. The prime sirloins (3/5) were very big in serving size but lacked flavor. I personally thought the steaks were a bit tough.There's so many steakhouses in New York. Unfortunately, Maloney and Porcelli was a disappointment for me. For slightly under $300, we left feeling unsatisfied. Service: 4/5Very nice waiter. He was attentive and eager. He got our tea order wrong but no big deal.Ambiance: 5/5Beautiful inside. Very classy and nice. Great date spot.",0
13406,"The space might be small, but the atmosphere and the flavors pack a big punch! The place usually fills up pretty quickly on weekends, but I arrived  10am and got a table no problem. Eggs siniya are baked in a skillet with tahini and served with olives, and cucumber/tomato salad on the side along with fresh hot pita! This dish is delicious and creamy, with the vegetables on the side providing freshness in each bite. Mushroom and onion omelette was simple but flavorful, and the greens on the side were wonderful! We also got home fries on the side, and they were very thinly sliced potatoes - simple but satisfying. Definitely plan to go back to try the schnitzel and other dishes!",0
17284,"I visited this restaurant on a Thursday evening and was immediately struck by the cozy yet vibrant atmosphere; it was bustling without feeling overcrowded. The pricing truly impressed me, especially the Lanzhou beef noodles I savored for just $9. The broth offered a welcome kick of heat, though I wouldn't have minded a bit more spice evenly distributed - much of it seemed to linger at the top before mixing. The option to choose from five noodle types added a personal touch to the meal that I appreciated.

A pleasant surprise was the complimentary eggplant appetizer, a perk unlocked with a Yelp check-in; it was exceptionally flavorful, with a sauce that left a lasting impression - a highlight of the visit. Though I didn't sample the tea on this occasion, it's certainly on my list for a future visit. I’m already looking forward to my next meal here.",1
11374,"Went for happy hour with a few friends after work on a Friday. The place is cool--dark pub vibe. We didn't go downstairs, but upstairs was cool. There are long communal high tops, the bar and tables to sit at, but you can only sit at them if you order food. We got the pretzel and spinach dip, which was delicious. There's a nice selection of drinks, but that's where things can get confusing. I ordered the rose cider and got the largest size. On the menu next to the drinks are two prices (ex. $10/$15). When there is something like this on menus, it normally means, the small is the first price and the large is the second price. HOWEVER, to my much confusion (and I'm sure a lot of other people's), there is another list of prices at the top of the menu with other sizes. So it turns out my drink went from $12 to $20 all because this place has a confusing price list. I was disappointed and they should really fix their menu or have the waiters clarify so you're not surprised by the bill.",0
13050,"I'm absolutely delighted to award Beyond Sushi in Midtown a well-deserved 5-star rating! This gem offers an incredible array of super yummy and budget-friendly vegan options.

Plus, they serve cocktails that are tempting for a future visit. Can't wait to return for more!",1
1206,"I came here three times. Once for the pre-opening lunch, dinner, and lunch (free bowl). I've been trying to like this place, but each time I come back, I'm disappointed in that there's no change or substantial improvement even though they were attentive and asked for our feedback. Honestly, I've been hoping that they'll improve. The dinner shareables are great. A little pricey (for example, $16 for octopus), but each plate was presented beautifully and tasted decent. The bowls were the same as the ones for lunch, just that you can't customize them. The soup (ramen) was underwhelming -- lacked flavor and richness, thin pieces of pork belly (add-on), and kinda weird toppings (kimchi??). Lunch is a little confusing. You get to build your own ""poke bowl"", but you only get to choose either one hot protein or one cold protein (raw fish or crab salad). The second time I went, I was not offered forbidden rice ($1 extra), tofu, or salmon, but they were clearly there... so I'm not sure if that's just not part of lunch anymore. Another concern that I have is that most of their toppings are raw/cold. I'm not sure how I feel about raw/cold tomatoes, corn, pineapples, or bean sprouts in my warm rice bowl. Ultimately, I had a tough time choosing 4 toppings. Finally the dressing problem. During their pre-opening lunch, we recommended that they have a sign with descriptions of what their dressings were. They have cool names, but even the servers in line did not know what was in it for sure. The second time I came back, they had a sign with the names of the dressings, but still when I asked what was in a particular one (like the Hot Mama), the server had trouble describing it. I think bowls for lunch come out to be around $15-18 for lunch, which is not ridiculous for the area. However, for what you get and the quality of the food (how toppings are basically raw and unseasoned) makes it not worth it. tl;dr great service, clean environment, but poor quality food and probably would not come back any time soon.",0
12188,"This place was a cool experience, especially if you love ball. There's a mini court with a couple balls to toss around inside.We just popped in because of a recommendation from a local friend. I only wanted a drink and then to use the bathroom, but we saw the app list, and HAD to get the fried Mac & cheese balls. If you like fried stuff and Mac & cheese, this is for you. If you are a cheese lover, this is your dream- it comes with a cheese dipping sauce, just in case is proves not to be cheesy enough for you... I don't love cheese, but I did like to have a small dip on my balls.They do have a decent happy hour, and the deals are pretty good on drinks- margarita $8, certain drafts $5, well drinks $5 and then some apps. I got a cider, and it wasn't on happy hour, but it was only $8.Our bartender was kind and quick when we needed him, and he didn't mind refilling or water glasses when our drinks & app was done, which was much appreciated!The bathrooms are kinda confusing- there are no men or women bathrooms- just many bathrooms, all with doors, and then a main sink area.

3453,"I met up with a friend from college to catch up at Lil' Frankie's and was impressed by their brunch deal! It was $14 3-4-1 Proseccos, so basically you spend $14 and you get 3 proseccos for the price of 1. That in and of itself was worth popping over for the drink deal, especially given how hard it is to find affordable food & drink in the city. We came right at opening time so it wasn't too busy - definitely something I appreciated because the service was fast & attentive. Something to be mindful of is that this restaurant is cash only, so definitely make sure that you have cash on hand when you come. The rest of the menu items with regard to food were fairly pricey, but that's not surprising for NYC. I ended up going with a simple eggs, bacon & toast and spent around $34 on the meal & drinks altogether. Not too bad for NYC, but definitely didn't think the food was necessarily worth the price for simple eggs, toast and bacon. That being said, everything in the city is super expensive, so no knocks against this particular location. Worth a try for their drink deals!",0

1888,"Really cute, Pinterest-y interior. Humble and warm. Windows open in summer months for an outdoor feel. Service was on top of everything and helpful. Food presentation was exceptional and everything did taste good...don't get me wrong. However, some items fell flat compared to my expectation. APP: Meatballs were tender and tomato sauce was tangy. No major complaints just didn't blow me away. Mozzarella sticks did not have much of a pull; cheese was a little hard inside. The sauce for dipping was delicious though! A sort of pesto tzaiki. Truffle Mac & cheese lived up to expectation, ooey gooey in a skillet! ENTREE: The ""special"" or burger on focaccia with a huge fried slab of mozzarella had a really great sauce and was very hearty, but the meat was flavorless and over cooked (asked for medium). Truffle fries on the side were yummy and perfectly crisp. DESSERT: Nutella cheesecake was SUCH a disappointment. Could barely taste Nutella and was not creamy texture wise--tasted defrosted from the freezer. Would NOT order dessert here again. DRINK: Enjoyed the wine, recommend their Montepulciano. Would still return as I must try the instafamous burrata pizza--but I'll keep expectations mediocre for that time around.",0

3359,"Title: A Mixed Experience at a Trendy Spot

Last Saturday night, my dining experience was a blend of hits and misses. On the upside, the food, including the bagel, eggplant, and octopus, showcased unique flavors and was well-prepared, contributing to a solid 4 out of 5 rating. The restaurant’s vibe was particularly impressive, scoring a 4.5 with its trendy and inviting atmosphere.

Unfortunately, the service didn't quite match up, receiving a mediocre 3 out of 5. Our server's insistence on us ordering more, despite our lack of appetite, came off as pushy rather than attentive. It's worth noting that the prices felt steep, with a per-person cost of $50 for three medium-sized dishes that could leave some patrons questioning the value for money.

In summary, while the cuisine and ambiance are commendable, the service approach and pricing might dampen the overall experience.",1

My rating would be 4 out of 5 stars.",1
1357,"During NYC Restaurant Week, the true standouts know how to make an impression, and this establishment certainly did. For $42, I indulged in six beautifully presented bowls of seafood and rice paired with chopped beef and creamy marrow, all without a hint of the menu shrinking or dish simplifying that can often plague such events. It was a full showcase of signature offerings at an appealing price.

The standout dish was an innovative take on chirashi don, featuring lightly-seared tuna and salmon with a house-made sweet shoyu sauce that elevated the dish far beyond its traditional roots. Alongside it, the classic combo of raw shrimp, ikura, and tamagoyaki hit the spot, ensuring it's a classic for a reason. The kampachi with jalapeno ponzu didn't quite align with my preference for pure Japanese flavors, but the quality and execution were undeniable.

Ending on a high note, the marrow served with tartare was a revelation that more restaurants ought to adopt. My experience here wasn't just satiating – it guaranteed my return, and soon.",1

My recent visit to this eatery for a workday breakfast was overall satisfactory. The server was pleasant and efficient, ensuring we had a good dining experience without any lengthy waits - ideal for a quick in-and-out meal. The restaurant's location added to the convenience, easily accessible for everyone attending.

While the establishment was able to accommodate our group of eight with a reservation at 9:30 am on a Tuesday, the interaction was somewhat marred by the staff's stern warning about punctuality. Despite that, the food was quite enjoyable; nothing extraordinary, yet satisfying. The Nutella French toast stood out - it was delicious and is a recommended treat to share among the table.

Price-wise, I did not have the chance to view the bill, but I anticipate it aligns with the typical New York City premiums. If you're seeking a no-fuss venue for a decent breakfast and efficient service, this spot does the job.",1

We both left feeling satisfied!",0
11750,"My usual mindset is to start with 5 stars and work backwards to account for not-so-great factors. In this case, we had a rough start so the algo is reversed. Why so? Well, if you don't honor your own lunch specials being hawked about literally 500 ft away then something is awry. Wait staff kept pushing for the buffet or a la carte as if the lunch special card the nice  person standing in the cold was passing to the folks walking up and down the 7th was a souvenir postcard. Well it gets worse before getting marginally better. I don't think they give any regards to holding the contamination line between vegetarian and the meat entrees. For an Indian restaurant in the center of the tourist universe, where no doubt unsuspecting visitors from India with religious beliefs dine, one would expect a bit more empathy, if not outright accommodation. Where do I begin? First, common fryer for meat and non-meat (learned of that *after* I had already had their fried papadum). No proper separation on the buffet spread table where serving utensils  freely ""socialize"" with each other. To make it worse, the vegetarian entries were cold, insipid, and an excuse for food. This during peak lunch hours. Appalling experience indeed!So why the two stars? When Naans (flatbreads) ran out, the staff (I think the owner himself) served some fresh fluffy naan breads. Saved the lunch for me. Second star for the wait staff who at least honestly answered that they don't have separate deep fryers. I don't expect to visit tHem anytime soon. I would be happy to reconsider if the management makes some truly visible changes to address the contamination issues. Other than that, the play was entertaining.",0

A testament to resilience, it re-emerged from the ashes of 9/11, transitioning from a casual hangout for local professionals into an impromptu shrine for Ground Zero workers, its walls now a mosaic of patches, badges, and memories.

But it's not just the tangible nostalgia that draws you in; the pub boasts an impressive roster of beers, with a perfectly poured Guinness on tap that's as smooth as the tales are poignant. Locals often tout their burgers, and true to form, I succumbed to sampling one. The verdict? Absolutely worth it, even on a full stomach.

Whether for the history or the refreshments, this Ground Zero Pub is a must-visit. Swing by, sip on a cold one, and leaf through their heartfelt scrapbook documenting the events that reshaped the neighborhood and the nation.",1
19051,"**Brunch at The New UWS Gem**

Recently, I had the pleasure of brunch at a new spot in the Upper West Side that's been generating some buzz. While originally enticed by the prospect of sampling pastries, my focus swiftly shifted to the main menu offerings.

The Savory French Toast with Lox, Crème Fraîche, and Spring Onion was an innovative spin on a classic combination, and it did not disappoint; its robust flavors and perfect texture were a highlight. Meanwhile, the Mac n' Cheese - a delightful twist using penne with rich Gruyere and topped with a generous helping of bacon - hit all the right notes of comforting gooey goodness.

For a lighter option, the Grilled Chicken Breast Sandwich, enhanced by a smoky chipotle aioli and served on a soft milk bread roll, was executed beautifully, with the succulent meat stealing the show. The accompanying fries, however, did lack a bit of the desired crispness.

I had hoped to delve into a bread and pastry basket, but a lack of recommendations from the server meant I missed out on what could've been signature items. The quality of the bread used in both the French toast and the sandwich, though, was commendable.

Service felt somewhat lacking, leaving me hesitant about a quick return. But the food quality and the safe, yet satisfying variety on the brunch menu do make this a worthwhile stop if you find yourself in the area without plans. The dishes I sampled were undoubtedly tasty, even if the experience as a whole wasn't exceptional.",1

The menu featured intriguing options, of which we sampled the Ganja and the Quiet Storm. The Ganja, a dipping ramen, stood out with its intensely flavorful broth that complemented the noodles perfectly. In contrast, the Quiet Storm felt like a milder sibling – well-prepared, yet lacking the robust punch of the Ganja.

My dining companion and I couldn't miss the chance to dine at this gem before it shuttered, so we braved the notorious wait times and landed at the restaurant on a bustling Friday at 12:30 pm. As expected, we were faced with a lengthy wait of an hour and fifteen minutes, but it proved worthwhile for the experience that followed.

Nestled on a serene corner, the restaurant offered a welcoming open seating area that immediately set the stage for a relaxed meal. We started with the bruschetta, which was generously topped with ricotta, peas, and a perfect hint of olive oil. It was a delightful starter that easily catered to four people, invigorating our palates with its lightness.

The bucatini, which I can confidently claim as my personal highlight, was a revelation with its impeccably al dente texture and a pronounced pepper flavor that animated each bite. Moving on to the pollo al forno, the dish impressed with exceptionally tender chicken cloaked in a crispy, rich skin – a testament to the kitchen's prowess.

Portion sizes were spot on, leaving us satisfyingly full without the burden of excess. The care invested in each dish was palpable, presenting us with a symphony of flavors that were bold yet harmoniously balanced.

13104,"Title: A Taste of Hanoi with a Side of Squeeze

I recently dined at Hanoi House, a spot that's been buzzing in the food scene ever since its doors swung open. Despite the departure of their acclaimed former chef, John Nyugen, the restaurant continues to draw crowds and curiosity.

Securing a 6pm reservation on a Friday was easier than anticipated, though peak times were clearly in demand. The place quickly filled up after our arrival, with a staggering wait time of 1.5 hours by 6:30 pm.

The first thing to hit us was the cramped seating arrangement. To say it was tight would be an understatement; a challenge for patrons who prefer personal space. It's a compromise on comfort that seems unnecessary.

The menu boasted a variety of appealing dishes. We settled on the Summer Rolls as our appetizer— a standout for me with its unique twist of grilled pork sausage and crispy wonton bits, although my wife found them just ""OK.""

For mains, we had the Hanoi Style Beef Pho and Lemongrass Pork/Bun Cha. The Pho was good— a cleaner, less oily broth than most, but familiar. The Bun Cha, however, with its perfectly crisp pork spring rolls and flavor-soaked lemongrass pork, was impressive.

The food quality at Hanoi House is undeniable, though the premium prices may give some pause, as Vietnamese cuisine often comes at a lower cost elsewhere. The service was mixed, with our waiter on the ""blah"" side, though other staff appeared more energetic.

Hanoi House serves up great food with high-quality ingredients, worth a visit for those willing to spend a bit more. However, be ready for close quarters and a dining experience that might not always match the enthusiasm of its online buzz. A solid 3.5 stars for the food, but the experience as a whole leaves room for improvement.",1
18313,"Dian Kitchen serves up authentic Yunnan food, they don't cut corners and try to cater to the Caucasian palate and they stay true to their roots. The rice noodle soup and rice noodles are ridiculously delicious. With lots of new restaurants opening in the East Village, I highly recommend stopping by for lunch or dinner!",0
17020,"Title: A Culinary Gem That Calls You Back

I recently discovered a fantastic eatery and simply had to share my experience. From my very first visit, I was captivated by the divine harmony of flavors and textures on offer, compelling me to return mere days later.

Their happy hour is a steal with decent margaritas priced around $6. However, the star of the show is undoubtedly the Mexican street corn, a dish perfected with a masterful blend of subtle spice and creamy cheese that delights the palate. And let's not forget the delectable grilled cornbread!

On the recommendation of John, our exceptionally attentive waiter, I tried the jambalaya quesarrito. The smokiness of the jambalaya wrapped in a quesarrito was downright addictive – it's a must-try that will certainly bring you back through their doors. 

In summary, if you're in the mood for fantastic flavor combinations and standout service, this is a place you won't want to miss.",1
17395,"Title: A Late Night Gem in Chinatown

Last Saturday night, my evening in the city led me to Chinatown at half-past nine, with many eateries already closing their doors. Fortuitously, we stumbled upon a bustling spot that was still welcoming patrons, despite nearing its 10:20 pm closing time. Even with a party of eight awaiting seating, we snagged a table within minutes.

Service started off on a high note with prompt delivery of water and menus, although we experienced a brief delay in placing our order. The Extra Big Beef Soup Noodle ($9.75) was a standout, boasting robust flavor and an ample serving of beef without leaving a post-meal thirst – a dish I'd gladly reorder. The Grilled Pork with Vermicelli ($9.50) was another highlight, thanks to its perfectly seasoned pork chop and authentic fish sauce zest, served in a generous portion.

On the other hand, the Spring Rolls ($6.25) were merely satisfactory, and the Three Treasure Rice ($9) was unremarkable, featuring a too-skimpy egg portion amidst its accompaniments.

Service was fast and amiable throughout, with the added convenience of no price difference between paying with cash or credit. Despite a couple of dishes not hitting the mark, the experience was overwhelmingly positive.

In conclusion, this restaurant's inviting atmosphere, standout dishes, and excellent service make it a spot I would not hesitate to visit again.",1
12676,"Cute little Cuban restaurant in Spanish Harlem. Went in for lunch with family at around 1 pm. Was in the area to visit my father in law and brought him with us. The decor was pretty cool with a long bar with a tiki feel. The paintings on the walk represented Havana well and the music was traditional old time Cuban music from back in the day. There was a small stage with musical instruments such as bongos set up. The waitress informed us that they have live music Thursdays through Sunday. Since it was the middle of the day and a Wednesday, the restaurant was empty. The service was sufficient even though the waitress was pleasant and friendly. We ordered a Cuban sandwich and several tapas such as beef and chicken empanadas, ham and chicken croquettes, sweet maduros and a garbanzo stew for the table. The empanadas although filled with plenty plenty of meat and large enough to split and share were over fried and a little dry. The croquettes were tasty but also over fried. The maduros we sweet and again very dark from over frying. The Cuban sandwich was fresh, soft and warm but had very little pork and way to much mustard which over powered the taste. For dessert we ordered a flan, tres leche, bread pudding and a chocolate lava cake. All desserts were tasty and shareable. All in all it was a cute find but the food was mediocre. My father in law was in heaven since he is of Cuban decent but did notice at 94 years old that his dish, halibut white rice and black beans were not as authentic as he remembered. I think it would be worth another shot when visiting him again and possibly try other dishes that are not fried.",0
12333,"I ordered a chickwich and a side of small fries on a Thursday evening around 7pm in the summer.  The lines were super long and there was one cashier taking orders.   Most of their clientele seems to pays in cash so that added to the time of each transaction. The person who took my order (turned out to be a supervisor) didn't ask me if I wanted grilled or fried chicken in my sandwich. 20 minutes later after my friend got her food, I went up to the counter to inquire about the status of my food and they'd said they didn't know if I wanted grilled or fried chicken. I was there the whole time and someone could have asked me.  The fries had been sitting there for a while and were cold and soggy by the time the sandwich came out. The supervisor kindly gave me a free dessert and free soft drink for the inconvenience, but the food was not worth the wait or the  frustration when you just want fast, casual dining.",0
15878,"Came here for restaurant week. We called and were able to score a table for 2 during an off time for them. I appreciated the accomodation.This is a fancy, upscale dining experience. Everything from the appetizers to dessert are well done and beautifully plated. What stood out to me was their chocolate cake. It melted in my mouth. The sponge was so delicious, and unlike any cake I had before. The tables are a little close together, so I felt a little uncomfortable that I could hear everyone's personal conversations but the food made the experience worth it.",0
18256,"Love the chocolate. I am missing the cheesesteak on a waffle. Please bring it back. Today, I ordered a hazelnut waffle with a hazelnut shake. Do I enjoy hazelnut? The tables are too close on 1 1/2. We had to maneuver to get the four of us into the seats. Love it still!",0
17290,"Title: A Splash of Color and Comfort in the Financial District

Nestled in the bustling financial district, this spacious ramen spot delights with its vibrant decor and the relaxing strains of smooth jazz, setting the stage for a laid-back dining experience. On arrival, the absence of a greeter was noticeable, and it took a short while before being attended to—likely a result of being understaffed on MLK day, with one waitress adeptly juggling both sit-down service and online orders.

I indulged in their umami special, featuring succulent chashu and tender chicken nestled in a tonkotsu broth. While the proteins were cooked to perfection, the broth itself left me wanting more depth of flavor, seeming a tad diluted for my palate. The noodles maintained a pleasing firmness, contributing to a decent if not entirely memorable bowl of ramen.

In summary, this spot stands out for its ambiance rather than its culinary prowess, offering an adequate if not outstanding rendition of the classic ramen bowl.",1
17915,"I realized that there is a location in Brooklyn, after I recognized one of the ladies working there. I used to go to the Brooklyn one all the time but the quality there has gone down in the past few years. It was my first time trying out this Chinatown location and it was so much better!My friend and I came in on a Tuesday at around 7. It wasn't too busy at that point. We were pretty hungry so we decided to order a bunch of dishes to share. This is what we had, which was definitely enough to feed a third, maybe even a fourth person:Shrimp summer rolls - a bit overstuffed with lots of other ingredients. I almost couldn't taste the shrimp. Wouldn't order this one again.Vietnamese style pancake (pork, shrimp, onion, bean sprouts, and green beans) - I didn't care too much for this. It was overstuffed with bean sprouts. I love bean sprouts and all but it would have been nice to see more pork/shrimp in there. Seems like love overstuffing with fillers here.Spring rolls with rice vermicelli - this is my go-to dish and they do it well here. The spring rolls are extra crunchy, and I like that the shredded lettuce is razor thin.Banh cuon (steamed rice rolls with pork, shallots, and Vietnamese sausage). This was my first time trying this dish and I'm a little mad that I didn't find out about this sooner in life. It was really good. This was the one dish where they didn't skimp on the protein. It was also a lot bigger than I thought it would be. It came with four giant rolls.I saw they have bun rieu on the menu, which I can't seem to find very often at the Vietnamese restaurants in NYC. Definitely coming back to try that!",0
18607,"Title: A Broadway Gem for Taco Lovers

I was fortunate to discover this gem before a Broadway show, and what a delightful pre-theater experience it turned out to be! Nestled in the bustling heart of Times Square, this spot is perfect for anyone craving a quick, yet superbly crafted and affordable meal.

Do yourself a favor and make a beeline for this eatery – trust me, you won't regret it. The adobada taco was a revelation, each bite packed with flavor, while the carne asada was equally impressive, showcasing quality ingredients and expert seasoning. Both tacos come 'con todo', including a generous helping of fresh salsa, onions, cilantro, and - to my pleasant surprise - complimentary guacamole.

Whether you're a die-hard taco aficionado or simply looking for a satisfying, spicy kick, these tacos hit the mark. Even as the queue extended out the door around 6 PM on a Thursday, the efficient service ensured a swift and worthwhile wait. If you're in the area and hunger strikes, missing out on this place would be a true Broadway tragedy.",1
18361,"I recently savored a delightful dinner at this restaurant with friends and found every dish on the menu tantalizing. From the vast array of hot appetizers to the satisfying mains, the flavors did not disappoint. The karaage fried chicken was a standout, pairing superbly with their signature E.A.K pork fried rice. The pan-fried pork gyozas burst with the taste of ginger and chives, a testament to their juicy deliciousness.

For those with a penchant for variety, the mini poke/sashimi bowls and bowls with chicken or beef, complemented by rice and fish roe, provide a delightful taste adventure. Although the takoyaki balls could have been more generous with the octopus, they were still tasty, but it was the battered shrimp appetizer that unexpectedly stole my heart with its buttery crunch.

Beyond the food, the restaurant offers an authentic Japanese ambiance, reinforced by a curated selection of beer and sake. Service was nothing short of impressive – efficient, knowledgeable, and exceptionally friendly. The West Village location has always been a favorite, but this spot has cemented itself as a must-visit destination. Highly recommended!",1
1001,"I recently enjoyed brunch at Virginia's courtesy of a pulsd deal and found this hidden gem worth the slight detour. The charming decor, adorned with a collection of menus, creates a warm and inviting ambiance. The service at Virginia's was cordial and attentive.

A highlight was their generously-sized bellinis, which complemented the meal nicely. My sister and I indulged in a shared feast that included the delectably simple ricotta toast – the blend of fresh ricotta with a touch of honey was an absolute delight. We also savored the burger, which was juicy and cooked to perfection, nicely accompanied by a crisp side of pickles. The fries were also a standout, being perfectly thin and crisp, and further enhanced by a tasteful aioli.

To conclude the meal, the mint white chocolate mousse added an elegant touch to the experience, both in its intriguing flavor profile and its visually appealing presentation. Virginia's made an excellent impression, and I'm already looking forward to my next visit.",1
1431,"Very please with my service. I really want to come back with my friends to have some drinks. Came in during my lunch break to enjoy some brunch cause why not.

14948,"We visited Massoni on a weekday so I think we circumvented the weekend crowd as it is quite popular on yelp. The place was relatively empty that day. It's a part of the Arlo Nomad hotel and is located on the 1st floor. There is a separate lounge and a bar area to this restaurant. The dining area is really pretty with candle lit tables and red curtains. I read the reviews on yelp which suggested that their deep dish pies are very popular. So we got the mushroom pie which had mushrooms, French onion mascarpone and smoked mozzarella as toppings. I think it was pretty close to the Detroit style pizzas I've had back in Michigan. I loved the toppings and the pie crust! They were baked to perfection! There were some pastas I wanted to try but the pie was enough for a late dinner. I will be back to try out some of their special dishes and pasta. Ps: It's a great place for a date night :)",0
19638,"Title: A New Neighborhood Gem with an Unforgettable Bartender

Last weekend, my fiancé and I discovered an incredible spot that has quickly become our go-to restaurant. The highlight of our experiences was Carl – the neighborhood's newest and most amiable bartender. His enthusiasm and lighthearted demeanor added a special touch to our visits.

The ambiance is uniquely captivating, with movies projected onto the wall, contributing to the vibrant and cozy atmosphere. As for the food, it's been a delightful surprise each time. The Thai hot dog was a flavorful twist on a classic, the salad with its creamy avocado dressing was a fresh delight, and the baby octopus was cooked to tender perfection.

Carl has certainly won us over, and the food has sealed the deal. We're already looking forward to our next meal here. This is a spot we'd recommend to anyone looking for great food and an even better experience. See you soon!",1

My recent brunch at Rosie's only reaffirmed why it remains my go-to spot in the area. Despite its usual crowd, the staff was swift and gracious, ensuring we could enjoy the beautiful day dining outside without a lengthy wait. The service throughout our visit was nothing short of excellent; attentive without being intrusive, enhancing the overall experience.

The food, as always, was delightful. I indulged in the chicken enchiladas, which were expertly prepared and beautifully presented. My friend savored the pork tacos, and both of our meals were a testament to Rosie's consistency in quality and taste. Complementing my dish with a wonderfully crafted cocktail, I couldn't have asked for a more satisfying meal.

Rosie's, with its unwaveringly superb service and culinary finesse, has solidified its status as a local culinary gem. Whether for brunch or any other meal, it's a place that always hits the right spot.",1
17889,"This gem of a restaurant exceeded my already optimistic expectations with some of the best tacos I've had in ages. The commitment to freshness is evident, as they craft each taco to order with a choice of corn or flour tortillas. Every bite bursts with an impressive array of flavors that far surpass the simple taste of tortilla. For spice enthusiasts, the delightful salsa bar offers an array of options to dial up the heat to your preference. A must-visit for taco lovers in search of a flavor-packed experience.",1
3602,"I recently visited one of my favorite all-you-can-eat sushi spots where the experience is consistently delightful, priced at $27 per person. Despite its small size, the restaurant maintains a clean and welcoming atmosphere, and I appreciate their reservation system, which makes planning a visit a breeze.

The service stands out for being both friendly and efficient. When it comes to the menu, their special rolls steal the show with a diverse range of options to choose from. We opted for a sushi boat, and not only was the taste exceptional, but the presentation also added to the overall enjoyment of the meal.

It's worth noting that this place also handles a significant amount of take-out orders, which speaks to their popularity and food quality. Anyone with a love for sushi should definitely check this place out for an indulgent dining experience.",1
10923,"I visited this restaurant on a Monday evening and was pleasantly surprised by the absence of a wait time. We indulged in three dishes, starting with the spicy tofu. It featured a nice contrast in texture with a tougher skin and a soft interior but felt overpriced for a tofu dish.

The water-boiled fish, a standout at any Szechuan establishment, did not disappoint. The fish fillet was tender and flaked apart effortlessly, making for an enjoyable eating experience. Rounding out our meal was the beef dry rub, which was abundant in portions and pleasantly savory, although not particularly spicy – a straightforward dish that proved to be quite satisfying.

Overall, the dishes were well-crafted, though they leaned towards the expensive side, presumably due to the restaurant's location. The flavors were reminiscent of authentic Szechuan cuisine found in Chinatown. If you're in the area with a craving for Szechuan fare, this spot is worth considering.",1
14271,"Title: A Disappointing Second Encounter

I was left bewildered by the stark contrast between my two visits to this sushi spot. My initial experience was delightful, with the sushi making a lasting impression. However, my return was marred with issues from the onset. A lack of greeting upon entry set a chilly tone for the evening, a sentiment that regrettably extended to the food.

We opted for the Natsumi Sushi Sashimi Set, accompanied by pricy Toro Fatty Tuna. The sushi rice, a fundamental element of the dish, was alarmingly dry and bland. This issue permeated every roll and piece, significantly diminishing their quality. Even more troubling was having to expel bites of fish that were served icy cold - a sushi faux pas.

Dropping over $100, one would anticipate a meal that at least meets basic sushi standards, yet ours fell embarrassingly short. This experience extinguished any desire for a third visit, especially with a plethora of superior sushi offerings available in the city.",1
3439,"Title: A Cozy Farewell Meal at a No-Frills NYC Chinese Eatery

As our grand New York City adventure drew to a close, we sought out comfort in the form of Chinese cuisine, landing at a modest yet spotless little eatery. Our dinner commenced with steaming bowls of hearty hot and sour and wonton soups, each generously portioned far beyond the standard cup.

The highlight was a shareable plate of General Tso's chicken, featuring tender white meat in a light breading. Though sweeter than anticipated, it was well-balanced by the simplicity of accompanying broccoli florets. The side of brown rice was a fitting accompaniment, rounding out the meal.

What this place might lack in ambiance, it more than compensates for with affable service and fair prices. A solid choice for good Chinese food without any fuss. Apologies for the photos, some came out less than clear, but the flavors stood out just fine.",1
19481,"This is a beautiful restaurant, and far too fancy for me. I know this because the lights automatically turn on in the restroom, whereas I belong in places where I have to fumble in the darkness, touching the no-doubt sticky walls so I am obligated to wash my hands in a sink that will somehow make my hands even dirtier for having used it. This is not that place.Trattoria Italienne is high-ceilinged and grand. The staff will fold your napkin whilst you use their auto-illuminated facilities, change out your silverware even after the absolutely stunning amuse bouche (some sort of potato pancake that puts your aunt's best latkes to shame), and not even shame you if you want to take part in the Restaurant Week menu. We came in for a far fancier lunch than we had originally anticipated, and it was well worth the $26 for two courses.We dined on paté and goat cheese crostinis, reveled in polpettini and polenta, enjoyed ocean trout and braised shortribs. The tiny meatballs were excellent, and the goat cheese edged out the paté for second place amongst my favorite starters. The trout was lovely and light, and even though the shortribs did not fall apart as one might hope, the flavors were there and the accompanying potatoes made it all worthwhile.The best thing we ate, however, were the rich cappellacci di zucca. Tiny envelopes of pasta filled with butter and butternut squash, with a quince mostarda and a hazelnut amaretti. I barely even know what those last two things are, but I ate them and loved every second of it. Things move a bit slower than you might like if you're trying to get back to the office during a workday, but you're better off just getting a bottle of wine, staying all afternoon, and quitting your job anyway. Too bad I have to pay for things, or I would've.",0

Located right next to the beautiful library and the amazing greenery that is Bryant Park, this cafe is so perfectly situated for any type of dessert or coffee fix during your day! :)A good amount of seating despite heavy foot traffic. Prices are on the higher end, maybe even more than LPQ and definitely more than your avg deli or even Starbucks. But you come here for the quality and not quantity and relaxing, clean atmosphere. I had a late breakfast and lunch with a friend and ordered a croissant, eggs/mayo, and a small Tunisian bun/sandwich. $12 total. They had the Cardinal dessert (raspberry mousse cake) to sample and it was great!",0
18755,"I was amped to try Farida, which specializes in food from Uzbekistan! We came here for a case team dinner. I had no idea what Uzbek food is like, but now I believe it to be very similar to food near the Persian or Western China (Uyghur) region. Unfortunately, we received little to no service - the restaurant was super full on a Monday night, and the servers were frantically running around.We ordered a ton of dishes to share among three people, and left quite satisfied and stuffed. The spot is super intimate and small, so be prepared to cozy up against strangers! Assorted Mix SpreadWe were served a bunch of small dishes of different spreads; there was hummus, baba ganoush, some sort of fried eggplant mixture (bojon), a pumpkin spread, and some unidentified red spread that was slightly spicy. My favourite was the hummus - it was done quite well. Second was the pumpkin puree. While I typically love baba ganoush, it was my least favourite this time. It seemed to be made with some sort of mayo or cream-based, and felt much heavier than usual. I found it interesting that it was served with nan / a bagel-like bread - the nan was much more dense than other bread and therefore very filling. However, the spread to nan ratio was off, and we had to order more nan.Vitamin SaladThis salad was very light and pleasantly delicious! I loved the simple vinaigrette and the addition of fresh dill; the herb really helped to brighten and spruce up the dish. Although this was a simple salad made with sliced cabbage, carrots, and sweet peppers, it was one of my favourites of the night.Hand made Beef MantiThese big dumplings were good - the filling inside, seasoned with onion and some other spices, was flavourful. However, despite being steamed, I found the skin and inside to be a little on the dry side. It would have been better if there were slightly more soup inside. The sour cream helped to alleviate the meatyness and cut through the richness, and was a welcome accompaniment.Braised Lamb ShankSurprisingly, this lamb didn't taste gamey at all! It was simmered to the point of being fall-off-the-bone tender, and the sauteed vegetables accompanying the meat absorbed lots of the fragrant fats. I particularly liked the asparagus and sweet peppers. That said, the shank didn't taste particularly unique; just like any other ones I've had.Authentic Uzbek PilafThis pilaf was served at the very end, almost 15-30 minutes after our shank. I wish this dish came earlier! It was our indisputable favourite. The rice pilaf was very soft and tasty, having absorbed all the meat and vegetable flavours. I particularly liked the candied cooked carrots, while the beef and lamb were very rich and delicious. Unfortunately, we were too full by that time and couldn't finish it all!We also ordered a pot of Uzbek green tea for the table, which lasted us through the entire meal. My colleague also got a Kvass, but as it came too late, he couldn't finish it as he was too stuffed.Overall, Farida undoubtedly offers an authentic Uzbek dining experience. That said, being from Canada, it doesn't seem vastly different from comparable options, nor is it significantly better. Definitely a great experience, but there are plenty other options in NYC that I'd love to try.",0
13718,"Updated Experience - January 2020:I came here for a dinner for an anniversary celebration. We had the biscuits, fried chicken, string beans, macaroni and cheese, key lime pie, pecan pie. I'll start with what I loved. We also had some of the bourbon, rose, and a bourbon baileys dessert drink as well. The macaroni and cheese is well worth ordering here! It's significantly better than my first time dining here. It's packed with so much garlic flavor with a spice. I would come here just to eat macaroni and cheese. It's really difficult to find lately. String beans were in garlic and had a crispy crunch (I love this! I really don't like overcooked vegetables). The biscuits have and will always be my absolute favorite here. I love pairing it with the salt and sesame with the honey sauce. The pecan chocolate pie is so different and truly spectacular. It's something different to order. Key lime pie is very well made and excellent as well. I just try to order items that are unique to the menu. The bourbon baileys drink was very frothy and a dessert in its own. Probably not my cup of bourbon but a wonderful dessert beverage. Lastly, the chicken. The chicken was crispy this time. It did not have a lot of excess grease (almost none). I did feel that it was slightly dry. Needless to say, they provide a hot sauce and a sweeter honey sauce to add on top. It would have been better if it wasn't all very dry. We were there to celebrate our anniversary. Restaurant is very small. It's an intimate environment. While making reservation, we had mentioned it was our anniversary. Annually, a restaurant will do something special for our anniversary and this did not happen. The service was very friendly, attentive and accommodating. Just disappointing they didn't do something a little special to add to the southern hospitality for our special day. First Experience 2019 warm weather: Fried Chicken galore! We ordered the full chicken and shared between two people. We had plenty to bring home for leftovers.the fried chicken was tender. I do wish some of the pieces were a little crispier. I felt like the wing was lacking any sort of crunch. Needless to say, it was one of the best pieces of fried chicken I have had in NYC. The tobacco honey sauce here is everything! It compliments the chicken very well. I absolutely loved the Macaroni and cheese! It was baked to perfection and I give this 5 stars. Asking for hot sauce is a must! Sweet tea (half and half) was very refreshing. I have been to the south and boy does Georgia make their tea sweet. So happy to have the right amount here! The mismatched plates here are such a cute touch and give a nice home style feel The biscuits here were so dense and delicious. They were very moist and not as flaky and dry as most are in the south. I loved that they were served with salt, rosemary. The found that I did not love the dipping sauce for the biscuits. However, the presentation had a nice touch. Service was very attentive and accommodating - and this was nice. I am looking to trying dessert next time!",0
16865,"For vegans, surely one of life's great injustices is that we do not really ever get to indulge in French cuisine. It's a brutal cuisine (livers of force-fed geese, legs of cute muppets and other furry RL animals.. do I need to go on?) but they do magical things with sauces, food preparation and arrangement. Surely this could be applied to vegetables, non? Oui! Delice & Sarrasin, merci for allowing plants to take over the starring roles of traditional French dishes like Steak tartare, escargot and ratatouille!This place is so tiny, so delicate, so charmingly French that I feel as though I stepped off a winding street of Montmarte. Reservations are a must. Upon entering, you'll see that it's so tiny that there isn't room for a host stand. In fact, there isn't even room for a host, it's just two very attentive waiters working the room, one of which apologized and let us know that we'd have another half hour to wait before our table was ready. We were hungry and I had a train to catch home, but you simply CANNOT get annoyed here. Channel up your inner Amélie and think of the incredible food that will you will soon be tasting.We strolled over to Boucherie, a few doors down (I know I know. You can't get less vegan than Boucherie but they have a nice bar to sit at) and returned as soon as they texted us that our table was ready. Now I cut to the chase: that glorious cheese plate. Oh oh oh oh oh. My dining partner is not vegan but she loves a good cheese plate as much as I used to and still do (I order a vegan cheese plate whenever I encounter one). I believe the cheese varies from time to time, but my favorites were the bleu style and a smoky, creamy blissful slice of heaven that spreads beautifully on the country bread slices that comes with. I could have easily made this my dinner. If you're on the fence about ordering this, jump off and just get it. You won't be sorry.And then came the foie gras, something that I've actually never had before (even when I was a meat eater, this just didn't seem appealing to me). To be specific, black truffle (zounds!) over foie gras over Impossible steak over toast. The foie melts in your mouth, as I've heard the real thing does, too. The steak is also delicious, as Impossible products always are and the delicate sauce complimented everything perfectly (and the truffles... oh merci, merci!). I also appreciate the tender asparagus spears  that graced the plate. The entire ensemble just makes one feel like they are celebrating a special occasion.My friend had the French onion soup and she said it was excellent. I cannot imagine NOT ordering it myself next time as this has been a favorite of mine since childhood.We couldn't pass up dessert and decided to share the quintessential French dessert: chocolate mousse. It's as rich as you'd expect and slightly bittersweet, which cuts on the richness. I'm admittedly more of a fruit tart lover but this is an incredible offering that you will not believe is dairy-free.There is so much goodness at Delice & Sarrasin. This is now my favorite special occasion vegan restaurant in Manhattan (and sometimes, a Wednesday evening after work is reason enough to indulge).",0

My friends and I recently enjoyed a relaxed Sunday dinner at this delightful Italian spot. Though navigating the restaurant felt like a small adventure due to its maze-like layout, we settled comfortably at our table. The evening kicked off with a round of pizzas and calamari, each dish bursting with freshness and flavor.

Opting for the Chicken Parmesan, I found it deliciously satisfying, though the portion size left me craving just a bit more. It's worth noting that servings here are not your typical hearty Italian fare. The ambiance was as cozy as the food was comforting, creating an ideal setting for a laidback meal.

As a newcomer to the New York pizza scene, I didn't know what to expect from my first foray into the city's famed culinary offering. I'm pleased to report that this humble little pizzeria was a delightful surprise. There’s a catch, though: seating is scarce and you won't find a restroom here, so plan accordingly. 

Despite its small size, this spot is clearly a local hit. Evidence of its popularity can be seen in the steady stream of customers—many of whom are content to grab their slices to go. Their menu features classic favorites such as caprese, white cheese, and pepperoni, as well as hearty options like meat and spinach-topped slices. 

Prices are reasonable, ranging from $3 to $5 per generously sized slice, or you can opt for a whole pie to share—or not, I won't judge! The pizza itself? It’s truly noteworthy, boasting a perfectly crunchy thin crust that doesn't skimp on flavor.

Outdoor and limited indoor seating are available, but don't let this deter you. This pizzeria is absolutely worth the stop. Whether you're a local or just passing through, these slices are sure to satisfy your pizza cravings.",1

My first visit to [Restaurant Name] was marred by a series of service issues that left me regretting my decision to dine here. Upon arrival, my party was not greeted, leaving us confused about the seating protocol. We seated ourselves at a dirty and sticky table, where we were overlooked for over 30 minutes before receiving menus with the instruction to order at the bar.

Despite this, I witnessed newly arrived guests receive prompt and attentive table service – a stark contrast to our neglected state. I had the displeasure of watching a waitress, Elisa, prioritize other customers while simultaneously ignoring our needs and even her own instructions for us to order at the bar.

The food was as underwhelming as the service, with overcooked and bland mac and cheese alongside a portion of French fries that didn't justify the price. The overall experience was further soured by a lack of common courtesies such as a refill of water or a simple 'thank you' upon our departure – courtesies that were clearly extended to others.

Service: 0/5
Food: 1/5
Cleanliness: 0/5

In conclusion, this visit to [Restaurant Name] was a lesson in how not to treat customers, accompanied by mediocre food. It was an experience I do not wish to repeat and cannot recommend.",1
14918,"I love italian restaurant and it's always my first choice.I love pizza I love pasta.Saturday evening, My significant other and I chose to go this restaurant.  and it was the perfect choice to go Patzeria!! I strongly recommend If you like to go that pace you should make a reservation before you go. otherwise you may need to wait little longer. We had a reservation so we didn't need to wait too long.So, as a starter I had small house salad which was so fresh and delicious salad dressing. cutting of the vegetables freshness of tomatoes was so great. I still could smell the tomatoes. As a entree, I got rigatoni bolognese it was well sauced and lots of beef was on that. definitely it was a perfect choice of the evening.  As a triple chocolate mousse cake. Normally, chocolate cake can be very strong, but this one you may not want to finish. it was so delicious.probably I may have a few chocolate cake as a full meal. I love that!!!Thank you Patzeria",0
12097,Great place for breakfast! When you walk in you order at the counter and they will bring your food to the table. You can also beer or wine early in the day. I got the croissant  sandwich with potatoes. It was amazing and fresh! Definitely worth checking out and they have other locations as well!,0
13158,"Title: A Delightful Brunch Experience

I recently visited this gem for a Saturday brunch and it certainly lived up to the hype. The extensive menu immediately caught my eye with its array of tantalizing options. Despite the usual weekend rush, the wait time was quite reasonable, and if you're up for it, opting for counter seating can get you settled in even faster.

I indulged in the Biscuits and Gravy Skillet which was a standout. Served piping hot in a charming little skillet, the dish was the perfect mix of hearty and comforting. The gravy boasted a flavorful spice kick, harmoniously balanced with the subtle sweetness of the biscuits. Completing the dish, the poached eggs were perfectly executed—an ""egg-cellent"" addition indeed.

Service was noteworthy; the server was attentive, informative, and happy to offer food insights and recommendations. To wash it all down, the Drunken Lemonade was a refreshing choice, with just the right amount of tangy kick to complement the meal.

In conclusion, this spot is a solid choice for brunch, capable of pleasing both the palate and the soul. It's definitely on my list for a repeat visit and warrants consideration for any meal. Highly recommended!",1
15986,"A bar that was all decked out not like a Victorian establishment, but ended up being dressed up for a Chinese New Year celebration...very weird overlay. Better to go with the straight-up Victorian theme, in my opinion.Happy hours daily 4-6(?)pm from Monday-Friday, $6 select beer and house wine. It's a dark bar with friendly bartenders and seating was packed with folks. Our party of six ended up having to stand around (better to get reservations), and we didn't try the food this time.",0
19500,"Well I finally figured out why this place has such horrible reviews.  Mind you, I've come a few times (during dinner) and could never understand why it has 2.5 stars.  Well going for brunch made it all make sense.  We arrived on a Sunday afternoon with a 1:30 reservation for a group of 4;  there was plenty of room inside which could be an indicator of a first bad sign (we all know the best brunch spots are packed and hard to get seated without reservations).  Putting that aside, we were seated outside on a lovely warm afternoon (yay!) Their brunch includes an entree and 2 cocktails for $16.95... sweet!  We were looking through the menu for a while before we were finally greeted by our server. I ordered a spicy watermelon margarita (the menu in no way indicates limitations to the brunch drinks included), he hesitated but ending up saying ""ok I can do that for you"" and continued taking the rest of my party's drink orders.  Our drinks came a little while later and I was very happy with mine (the spicy chili lime rim is everything!!!!) I ordered nachos to start, my friends the corn and we ordered our entrees.  The appetizers came out and they were good as always.  The real problem came when our food came.  I ordered the brunch bowl as it seems highly recommended on what good reviews there were.  My friends ordered steak & eggs x2 and a avocado grilled cheese.  I noticed upon first bite that my food was cold. I mixed it around but it was cold from top to bottom (the eggs, rice, everything).  None of my other friends were happy with their food as they reported it was bland and not impressive.  They also gave my bf scrambled eggs instead of fried and when he addressed this the waiter said ""just keep them i'll get another order for you"" ; my bf took them off his plate since he doesn't eat them that way and was given scrambled eggs on the side.  Once we received the bill we found that he was charged for the eggs as if they were extra.  We also found that we were charged an additional $5 for the drink flavors (x6) even though I'm the only one who got the flavored one and the waiter never mentioned an additional charge. All in all, I would not return for brunch based on the terrible food and poor service. To make a long story short:Brunch food: horribleRegular food: (nachos & corn) yum!Drinks: yum! Service: no bueno this time around",0
17194,"After spotting this gem on Instagram, as gnocchi enthusiasts, we had to check it out. It lived up to every expectation. The ambiance was as delightful as it appeared online—cozy and welcoming, enhanced by a charming glass wall adorned with wine bottles. We indulged in the Montepulciano, which was a perfect preamble to the heavenly Burrata, teasing our palates with its freshness.

The star of the show was undoubtedly the gnocchi trio—pesto, sorrentina, and Quattro formaggio. Each bite was a cloud-like indulgence, leaving us in a delicious dilemma over which flavor reigned supreme. Spoiler: it's a delightful tie. We're already planning our next visit—this spot is a definite must-return for us.",1
20402,"The food is very flavorful, the mango lassi is very smooth and creamy. The service is very quick. I got the Live Fire Feast and Mango Lassi for $17. There are a good amount of seats and they have fountain soda. This location is good because it's one block from the train station. The paper straws aren't good. When I got to the bottom of my drink the straw fell apart and I couldn't use it anymore.",0
14064,Went for happy hour in the Saloon. Great deal on oysters and clams. Probably the first time I didn't eat all of the oysters I ordered. They were just meh. Same thing with the buffalo calamari. It was very chewy. Won't be going back. Server was nice enough. Didn't smile but was attentive.,0
20366,"I brought my friend here to try their lunch menu and, boy, were we stuffed and satisfied at the end haha. We barely had room for dessert! The lunch special portions are great, and since the food is homemade and healthy, it left us feeling very full without feeling heavy and groggy.First, they brought us bread with a few spreads. You know a restaurant is going to be good when they even put effort into making their bread delicious. It was stuffed with herbs, and had a beautiful golden brown crust with a light, fluffy inside. My favorite spread was the Pink Sultan spread which I ordered as my appetizer. It's made of beets, Greek yogurt, olive oil, and Turkish herbs. It's quite unique. I've never seen that at any other Turkish/Mediterranean restaurant before. It's slightly sweeter and richer than yogurt dip alone.My friend got the fried calamari as his appetizer. It was crispy and the ""chef's special"" tartar sauce was delicious.I got the baby okra cassarole as my entree. It's a dish of sauteed baby okras cooked in tomato sauce. The tomato sauce really tastes like it's homemade. There were maybe two okra pieces that were too fibrous and tough to chew, but it didn't ruin the experience. It was a minor thing. The other okras in the cassarole were perfect.  I would consider ordering this dish again.For dessert, we shared a plate of baklava. It was flaky and so sweet. The Turkish tea was smooth and just bitter enough to complement the sweetness of the dessert.Last but not least, the service was fantastic. Every was so welcoming and nice to us. You can tell that they really care and that they're passionate about what they do.",0
17787,"Tucked away in the vibrant streets of Chinatown, Pho Bar stands out as a Vietnamese culinary gem, albeit with a slightly higher price tag compared to its neighbors. Their penchant for inventive fusion dishes adds an exciting twist to the traditional pho offerings, catering to the palates seeking a little extra flair.

On a bustling late Sunday afternoon, my party of 10 found refuge in Pho Bar’s accommodating nature as they seamlessly merged tables to host us. Sampling their winter menu, we delved into the Mien Ga. This dish swaps the classic pho noodles with glass noodles, escorted by bok choy and chicken. While rich and savory, the soup did betray a sheen of oil more generous than some might prefer.

Despite this, the service was commendable, with our meals arriving promptly. A word to the wise—Pho Bar is a cash-only establishment, so come prepared. In summary, the restaurant stands as a worthy destination for those willing to pay a bit extra for a twist on Vietnamese classics, served up with efficiency and a warm welcome.",1
18637,"I stopped by this local spot right at opening on a Saturday morning and found the place to be pleasantly uncrowded, a hidden gem that's yet to be discovered by the brunch crowd. The interior offered cozy table seating and more casual bar stool options; I chose the latter and was promptly presented with an extensive beer list by a friendly bartender. Opting for an IPA ($8), I paired it with Mac and Cheese Bites ($12) and the house's JRB Burger ($18), hopeful that the price would reflect the quality.

The bites were a delight: four generously-sized, perfectly browned cubes of gooey mac and cheese accompanied by a spicy aioli, though I admit a simpler hot sauce might have better cut through the richness. The burger arrived next, featuring a thick patty and a host of toppings including bacon and cheddar, although the meat was slightly overdone past my medium request. Despite that, it remained juicy and was enhanced by the savory bacon. While the pickles were meant to be fried and weren't, it seemed a blessing in disguise as finishing the substantial burger was already a feat. The side of fries was standard, nothing to write home about.

The server kept things lively with good conversation, and the kitchen kept pace with the relaxed atmosphere, sending out dishes in good time. With plenty of TVs around, I can see this place being a fantastic spot to catch a game. While the prices are on the high side, the food quality justifies a return visit.",1
10359,"I came back here because my boyfriend really loves this place and I can't deny him anything. We walked in having made our reservation and were promptly seated outside at our choosing. The service here is fine, a little cuts, but is to be expected.We ordered the only redeeming dish here at this restaurant, the pork buns. This time, they weren't even that good and I was again disappointed. The bread was really soggy and almost wet and not from the normal delicious pork sauce.Boyfriend again ordered the spicy tonkatsu and usually is really excited and raves about it, but this time he was more quiet. I asked him about his dish and he picked up a piece of flaccid, crumbly, and viscous (gross) slice of what is supposed to be pork. He was crestfallen. He did not think the broth was as good.I ordered the vegetable Japanese ramen, which I didn't have high hopes for, but hoped that this time I wouldn't be poisoned. I received my dish very lukewarm. It tasted as though the base curry was from a box. It was overpoweringly salty, yet had no flavor. I would actually probably prefer the box. The vegetables were soggy and not at all fresh.Overall, I continue to be disappointed by this place and again, do not wish to return. This location in particular has gone down in service and food quality. If you really want to eat their food, I would recommend making the trek to 125th street.",0
18885,"If you're eager to break away from traditional pizza offerings, Sauce Pizzeria on the Lower East Side should be your next stop. Their innovative menu includes a standout Al Pastor Slice that's a must-try for taco enthusiasts. This slice, priced at a reasonable $4, comes loaded with savory roasted pork, tangy pickled red onions, fresh cilantro, spicy jalapeño, and sharp pecorino, complete with pineapple sauce on the side that elevates the flavors to new heights. It's where Taco Tuesday and Pizza Friday blissfully collide. Don't miss out on this culinary gem that truly satisfies the adventurous foodie's soul.",1
18929,"Title: A New Twist on Steakhouse Dining - Pepper Lunch

Upon visiting Pepper Lunch, a newly opened franchise taking over where Ikinari once stood, I was met with a mix of novelty and familiar chain atmosphere. With over 60 locations worldwide, primarily in Asia, this concept brings a do-it-yourself flair to the steakhouse scene, inviting diners to cook their steaks on personal hot plates.

The interior boasts instructional wall art, guiding patrons on how to achieve their preferred doneness, a unique touch that brings an interactive element to the meal. The attention to detail extends beyond the dining area, with a bathroom that impresses with its bidet, heated seats, and mouthwash – amenities that speak volumes about the establishment's standards.

I opted for the kimchi pepper steak meal, which, despite my anticipation, fell short of expectations due to its overly salty flavor and lack of spice. However, the service was notably exceptional, particularly considering the no-tip policy. A notable gesture of customer care was extended when the front-of-house staff generously offered me a happy hour drink outside the designated time.

While my initial experience was underwhelming in terms of the food, the service quality alone compels me to return and explore other options on the menu. Hopefully, a different entrée will match the high service standards on my next visit.",1

Opting for a warm treat, I ordered a hazelnut hot chocolate, which to my delight, was available in various flavors. The hot chocolate was served piping hot, exceptionally rich, and the hazelnut flavor was genuinely authentic. The cozy ambiance, complete with tiny round tables and pictorial menus of their offerings, added to the experience. While I didn't indulge in the gelato on this visit, the temptation was strong, and I am certain that I will return to try it when the craving strikes.",1

The interior of the store was small but cozy, the smell of freshly baked pastries and bread will greet you as you entered the room.

1417,"Title: A Cozy Dining Experience Near Penn Station

I recently dined at a charming little restaurant just a stone's throw away from Penn Station. The food truly delighted my taste buds with its delicious flavors. Here's a pro tip: use the Yelp waitlist to breeze past any lines and be seated swiftly!

The interiors may be compact, but they exude a cozy atmosphere that adds to the overall dining experience. Plus, to top off the meal, they serve a complimentary gin shot, which I personally found to be a delightful treat.

On the downside, there was a slight hiccup with a Yelp coupon for $4 off sangria. It wasn't clear that the discount only applied to a single glass and needed to be mentioned before ordering. The staff could have communicated the terms better to avoid any confusion.

Despite the issue with the coupon, the restaurant shines with its culinary offerings. Although the chicken was a tad too salty for my liking, I'll be generous and rate this spot 4 stars. It's an establishment worth visiting for a good meal, especially if you're around Penn Station.",1
17901,"Title: A Saturday Lunchtime Delight at the Ramen Spot

I kicked off my weekend with an early lunch at this bustling ramen haven, arriving to find a small crowd eagerly anticipating the doors' opening at noon. This place is neatly tucked upstairs next to its sister restaurant, Totto, and despite the initial line, seating was immediate.

The highlight of my visit was the spicy garlic ramen, which I regrettably didn't capture in a photo – a testament to how tempting the dish was. The broth struck a perfect balance, boasting a rich and creamy texture with just the right kick of spice. What's more, the ability to customize the noodle firmness and select between curly or straight added a touch of personalization to the meal. And the pork? Sublimely tender, it melted in the mouth.

While the food is a draw in itself, the ambiance truly sets this place apart. Adorned with an array of charming character masks, the walls offer an Instagram-worthy backdrop that complements the delectable dining experience. Whether you're a ramen aficionado or just in search of a cozy spot to enjoy a good meal, this restaurant should be on your radar.",1
15040,"El Aguila has won me over as the go-to destination for tacos, even amidst the quarantine. They've mastered the art of the taco with ample basic toppings like onions, cilantro, and lime at no extra charge, which is all you need given their rich flavors. The complimentary hot sauce selection adds an appreciated kick, with four varieties to choose from. Their double corn tortillas are a highlight, robustly cradling the star of the show: the tender and juicy carnitas that are, without exaggeration, the best I've ever had. When I'm feeling adventurous, I opt for the lengua tacos, but the carnitas are my steadfast favorite. El Aguila is a must-visit for taco enthusiasts seeking quality and taste.",1
14641,"Title: Cozy Breakfast Spot With a Side of NYC Charm

Review:

I ventured into this eatery on a bustling Saturday morning, pleasantly surprised to be seated immediately, although the tables were squished together, a typical New York City dining quirk. I began with a delightful black tea served in an adorable little pot, perfect for self-service refills.

My craving for cornbread apple french toast went unmet as it wasn't available that day, yet the accommodating server offered me a taste of cornbread with apple topping. It was delicious and left me longing for the full dish. Instead, I enjoyed the classic French toast, which was quite satisfying. My mom savored her eggs Benedict, deeming it a favorite choice.

Post-tea, I indulgently ordered a spiked hot apple cider, inspired by the neighboring table's steaming concoctions. Regrettably, mine arrived only warm. Despite the less-than-ideal temperature, the food's quality shined through.

Unfortunately, the experience was slightly marred when the server explicitly requested a cash tip – a touch of rudeness that can't be overlooked. Had the food been less impressive, this alone would have nudged me towards a 3-star rating. Nevertheless, the flavors redeemed the day, earning the restaurant a solid recommendation for breakfast fare with a New York twist.",1
10015,"Title: Friendly Staff and Eco-Conscious Choices at a Cozy Spot

I recently visited a local eatery where the warmth of the staff truly made an impression. Their kindness shone through from the moment I stepped in. Despite the limited seating, I secured a spot with ease and settled in for what promised to be a good meal.

I opted for the combo: a Beyond Burger with fries and watermelon lemonade, priced at $18. A heads-up from the chef about the burger's spiciness was spot-on—it packed quite the punch, a bit too fiery for my preference, and I say this as an enthusiast of spicy curries. The fries were slightly overdone, losing that coveted crunchiness, yet they retained an enjoyable flavor. The lemonade, on the other hand, was a highlight, offering a delightful and cooling counterpoint to the meal.

A minor inconvenience arose when I needed a knife and had to procure one from a neighboring establishment, as the restaurant does not provide them. However, the availability of a restroom and the acceptance of credit cards added points for convenience. The establishment's commitment to environmental sustainability was evident from the use of paper straws, a detail that did not go unnoticed.

While I might give the burger a miss on my next visit due to its intense heat, the congenial atmosphere and eco-friendly practices would certainly draw me back for a second round—perhaps to try something new on the menu in this fun and bustling setting.",1
18856,"I recently visited this restaurant for a weekday happy hour and was pleased to be seated without delay. The ambiance struck a pleasant note with inviting decor that added to the overall experience. We took advantage of the happy hour special, opting for the mango and strawberry margaritas at a reasonable $8 each. Both were flavorful and included real fruit pieces, though I found them a tad light on alcohol. The chicken nachos were a tasty choice—savory and well-prepared—however, the excessive amount of beans overwhelmed the dish, detracting from enjoyment as we delved deeper. Despite this, I had a good experience and plan to return.",1
20048,"Totto Ramen in Midtown East proves itself a hidden gem amidst the bustling streets of NYC, popular with an eclectic lunch crowd, from embassy personnel to discerning locals. The narrow space extends deeper than expected, leading to a lively back room echoing with jovial chatter—unexpected for a noon on a Tuesday.

The star of the menu is, unequivocally, the ramen. With a broth exuding a profound depth of flavor and impeccably cooked noodles, Totto Ramen secures its spot as a culinary bridge between the Far East and East Manhattan. The appetizers, though not the main draw, are noteworthy contenders too.

For an authentic taste of ramen that stands out in the city's competitive food scene, Totto Ramen Midtown East is a must. Simply put, it's 'Tottoly' legit! A definite go-to spot.",1

Although it seems dismally small for the price, the taco itself had excellent flavor and fresh ingredients. The chicken was juicy and tender from its yogurt and herb marinade. The small roti taco was overflowing with chutney and greens. There is limited seating indoors, but stop by anyway for a quick bite.",0
20270,"Title: Disappointing Experience at Salls

I'm hesitant to leave one-star reviews, but my visit to Salls was underwhelming enough to warrant it. Upon arrival at 11:10 am, we were rudely informed that they did not open until 11:30, despite their posted 11:00 am opening time. The staff member who greeted our large group did so with apparent annoyance and a lack of courtesy.

The food was another area of dissatisfaction, particularly the steak and eggs accompanied by bottomless mimosas that many of us ordered. Despite specifying how we wanted our eggs cooked, what we got resembled overcooked, hockey puck-like eggs, and my steak was disappointingly small and overdone. At a steep $35 per plate, it was unacceptable that so many of us felt compelled to return our meals. Even after sending the food back, my second steak was raw and only marginally improved upon its return.

Service for the bottomless mimosas was slow—nearly taking the full promised 90 minutes for enjoyment—and inconsistent in quality.

In summary, the service at Salls was disorganized, and the food was a letdown. Regrettably, the restaurant did not rise above the criticisms found in other online reviews. I cannot recommend visiting Salls based on this experience.",1

If you find yourself wandering the vibrant streets of New York, consider your dining plans sorted with this gem of a restaurant. It's not just a place to eat; it's a culinary experience that screams AMAZING and FABULOUS!

The ambiance strikes the perfect balance between trendy and comfortable, with music that sets the mood without drowning out your conversations. The decor? Absolutely FABULOUS, setting the stage for a memorable night out.

Now, let's dive into the food – and oh, what a delightful plunge it is! Each dish is a masterpiece, crafted to surprise and satisfy your taste buds. The One thousand & One night is the drink to order; it's impeccably balanced – not too weak, not too strong. The star of the evening had to be the lobster pad Thai – a genius combination that'll have you wondering why it hasn’t always been a thing. As for the pork belly, it’s tender perfection, harmonizing wonderfully with the kimchee fries.

While the early sell-out of their spare ribs at 6:20 pm was a bit of a letdown (the only reason they're not receiving a full 5 STARS from me), everything else on the menu is sure to impress.

Service? Impeccable. The staff works in seamless harmony, ensuring a delightful dining experience from start to finish. Special shoutout to the bartender – her skills are top-notch.

In summary, this restaurant is without a doubt a must-visit. It’s almost perfect, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone looking for a sensational meal in the Big Apple. 4 STARS!",1

Our waiter and all the staff were very friendly, our seafood lunch options were delicious- and they used seasonal ingredients, which I appreciated.

Catfish is made well, but lumped as a filet on top (was hoping for it to be spread out in chunks). The rest of the greens are fairly dry until you add the dressing.

13634,"Title: A Fair Feast for Restaurant Week at Smith and Wollensky

Having fond memories of Smith and Wollensky from a Boston visit, my expectations were high as I ventured into their NYC establishment for Restaurant Week 2018. However, it seems that my seasoned New York steak palate has discerned that this steakhouse doesn't quite cut above the average.

We kicked off our meal with a shared salad and fried calamari. Unfortunately, the calamari fell short, coming across as rather dry and leaving much to be desired. Our main course featured the classic steakhouse duo: a ribeye and a filet mignon, both ordered medium rare. The filet mignon emerged as the clear winner, tender and flavorful, while the ribeye didn't leave a strong impression.

The meal concluded on a sweeter note with cheesecake and chocolate cake. While desserts were satisfactory, they didn't eclipse the overall feeling that Smith and Wollensky, while an acceptable choice for Restaurant Week’s special pricing, wouldn't be my go-to steakhouse choice on a regular day.",1

During my visit, I took advantage of the reasonably priced lunch specials – a decision I did not regret. A standout dish was unquestionably the pork soup dumplings. Each dumpling was a flavorful, savory parcel that burst with rich broth upon the first bite, exemplifying the culinary care put into their creation.

If authentic Cantonese cuisine is what you crave, Dim Sum Palace is a must-visit with its four franchises across the city. My recent foray into their menu included the savory chicken broccoli and perfectly seasoned stir-fried noodles with beef - both of which were delectable.

While the lunch special is a bit on the expensive side starting at $12.50, it's possible to keep the bill reasonable by opting for the complimentary house tea instead of ordering drinks. Among their menu highlights are signature dishes such as Peking chops and seafood noodles that come highly recommended.

In conclusion, Dim Sum Palace delivers on flavor and authenticity, and while the prices are somewhat steep, the culinary experience is well worth it. Enjoy your meal at this haven of Canton gourmet!",1

If you're after a quick, wallet-friendly taco fix, this little joint won't disappoint. While it may not be the destination for traditional taco purists in New York City, those with a craving for something like Baja fish tacos will find themselves satisfied.

Portion sizes are modest – big appetites beware, you might need to order upwards of four tacos. The flavors are commendable; zesty guacamole and rich cojita cheese elevate each bite. Meat lovers might find the steak a tad dry; the chicken is a juicier pick. Vegetarians, rejoice – the mushroom taco packs a surprisingly flavorful punch with just the right amount of spice.

Seating is sparse, with one communal table and a handful of stools, so takeout might be your best bet. I left already planning a return trip for their quesadillas. All in all, it's a solid spot for a tasty taco treat.",1
16839,"Title: A Reliable, Casual Dining Spot with Happy Hour Perks

I recently dined for the second time at this neighborhood gem and was reminded of its reliable charm. It's the kind of place you turn to when reservation plans fall through, yet you're greeted with a warm welcome and a diverse menu. On this visit, I arrived just before the end of happy hour at 7:43 pm, delighted to indulge in a dozen oysters at a bargain price. Light and refreshing, they were the perfect choice for my still-full stomach from an earlier lunch.

My companions branched out to the fried catfish and lobster mac & cheese appetizers. Although the mac & cheese was on the petite side, closer to the scale of a modestly sized soup, it was rich with flavor. The catfish, on the other hand, was a hit with its generous size, making it a satisfying meal in itself.

While I've yet to try their signature boils, my experiences have left me satisfied. With its never-overcrowded dining room, consistently pleasant service, and enticing happy hour deals, this restaurant stands as a solid option for a casual dinner outing.",1
20979,"Title: A New Gem in Times Square: Momenteas

On a recent weekday evening, I had the delight of dining at the new Times Square branch of Momenteas. Known for their Chelsea location, this expansion retains the same minimalist and bright aesthetic, perfect for those seeking a relaxed, fast-casual dining experience.

My friend and I both indulged in their spicy beef noodle soup and shrimp har gau dumplings. The soup had a harmonious kick of spice that complemented the robust beef flavors, though I might suggest a richer broth for an even more tantalizing experience. The dumplings were a standout, rivaling those from a bona fide Cantonese dim sum spot, with a generous serving size to boot.

The menu, broader than Chelsea's, ventures into classic Chinese fare while still featuring their signature pokebowls and boba teas. This culinary expansion brilliantly fills a niche for diverse fast casual options in Times Square.

Prices are fair, with entrees ranging from $10-$15. Service was swift and commendable, thanks in part to the gracious owner, Katrina.

Momenteas is undoubtedly a welcome addition to my Times Square dining repertoire, offering quick, casual, and tasty meals for the bustling area.",1
15983,"Title: A Nod to Tradition at Grand Shanghai House

Nestled in the bustling streets of Chinatown, Grand Shanghai House has taken up the mantle of its predecessor, Joe's Shanghai, and carries on the legacy of mouthwatering soup dumplings. Stepping into this establishment, one is immediately struck by the familiar aroma of savory broth and pork, a scent that beckons the appetite and promises a meal reminiscent of old favorites.

The star of the show is undoubtedly the soup dumplings—plump parcels that burst with broth at the slightest nibble. The pork filling is rich and flavorful, enrobed by a sturdy dumpling wrapper that complements the meat's succulence. It's no surprise that the taste rings true to Joe's Shanghai enthusiasts, as the same skilled hands are said to be behind these culinary delights.

Venturing beyond the soup dumplings, the menu offers a variety of Shanghainese staples. The fried dumplings, while competently executed, are somewhat understated in flavor but find redemption when dipped in soy sauce. The scallion pancakes, although boasting a tasty profile, fall short on the expected crunchiness due to their thinness. However, the Shanghai stir-fry noodles are a revelation—perfectly seasoned, with an inviting oily sheen that doesn't overpower.

While some may argue that Flushing holds the crown for the ultimate soup dumpling experience, Grand Shanghai House stands as a worthy contender in Chinatown. It's a haven for those seeking the comfort of Joe's Shanghai without the wait and a solid choice for anyone in the area with a craving for Shanghainese cuisine. In conclusion, Grand Shanghai House is a commendable establishment that successfully captures the essence of a beloved classic.",1
17484,"I just experienced one of the best slices of pizza of my life. Despite the queue, trust me, it's entirely worth the wait. The square slice is outstanding - a true standout. But don't overlook the regular thin slices; they're equally fantastic. A must-visit for any pizza connoisseur.",1
20153,"THE BEST fast-casual place with healthy options. The build-your-own assembly line layout here is similar in style to that of Chipotle, but I definitely prefer Kati Shop's taste and quality. I wouldn't be surprised if this place turned into a popular chain.I got the grilled salmon panang curry with sides of green beans and mushrooms on top of a base of 1/2 riceberry and 1/2 sliced cabbage for an even $15 including tax. Price is fair, especially considering the generous slab of salmon (apparently fresh-cut daily imported from New Jersey). The salmon was perfectly juicy and tender and paired incredibly well with the panang curry. I normally opt for chicken with curry, but the salmon was so good and definitely worth the price premium. Curry flavor was on point, easily on par with some of the better Thai restaurants I've dined at. The rice and veggies were nothing mindblowing, but they rounded off the meal nicely and I left with a happy stomach.",0
11007,"Oh, Au Cheval, although you take reservations now.. the only available opening we were able to snag on a Wednesday night was still at 10PM! The atmosphere is feels chic and trendy - the ultimate NYC vibe.We started with the fried chicken, chicken liver as well as a few of the oaxacan old fashions. All of it was delicious in every way and definitely amped up our appetite for our burgers.We of course did the double with the bacon AND the fried egg on top. The entree only comes with a pickle so we ordered a side of fries on the side. It was so finger licking scrumptious, I wish we hadn't decided to share it to begin with.",0
19679,"I dined at Baodega on a Wednesday night around 6pm with a friend. We ordered the Pork Soup Dumplings and Shrimp & Pork Shu Mai as our appetizers. The Shu Mai came as an order of 4 and were super small. (They may look bigger in the pictures attached but they are miniature). We also noticed how non-soupy the dumplings were but they were good.  We ordered Sweet & Sour Ribs and Crystal Shrimp for our entrees. I was surprised to find that the ribs didn't come with rice, noodle or vegetables. Personally I think $18.00 is a bit pricey for ribs without a side. The sauce on the ribs most definitely made the dish.The shrimps were small and came on a bed of lettuce along with peas and carrots. This dish didn't necessarily taste bad but it seemed like something was missing. I didn't like the sauce that came with it either, it reminded me of apple cider vinegar. Lastly, the rice pudding. Picture rice and beans drowned in honey. I assumed it was the Shanghainese style of rice pudding but it was far from what I expected. Overall nothing I ate exceeded my expectations. If the ribs were reasonable priced or had a side I would suggest it but until then skip it.",0
14513,"On my second visit to this cozy Nomad gem, the experience was just as delightful. The service remains outstanding, with attentive staff that enhance the dining experience. The menu continues to impress, especially the monkey bread and octopus, which are standout dishes that deserve a special mention. While the meat options are tasty, as a Midwesterner, I have a different benchmark for comparison. Nonetheless, they are still quite pleasing to the palate. This place has certainly earned a spot on my go-to list, and I'm already looking forward to my next visit.",1
14745,"Title: A Yunnan Delight for Night Owls

I recently visited a Yunnan-style restaurant in Chinatown for a late-night dining experience with two friends, appreciating its 24-hour accessibility when other spots had long since closed their doors. The rarity of Yunnan cuisine in the area added to the allure.

The star of the night was the spicy soup broth with beef, served with an impressive variety of 11 toppings that ranged from corn and shrimp to quail eggs and tofu skin, complemented with a side of rice noodles and the generous offer of a free noodle refill. Although the pot arrived piping hot, a word of advice to future diners: start with the meat and gradually add the other ingredients, saving the precooked noodles for last.

The portion was substantial, and despite not opting for the additional noodles, I left thoroughly satisfied. The broth lived up to its spicy billing - a bold flavor that could comfortably be shared between two, especially with the refill option.

Service was notably swift and attentive, enhancing the overall dining experience. I'm already planning a return visit to explore the other broths on the menu.",1
20825,"Got this thru mealpal This is breaded chicken with rice, beets, green beans and peas I was afraid the breaded chicken will be too dry or have a rough crust. Even though it was lukewarm when I got it, the chicken wasn't too dry. The breading was thin which I'm ok with. It tastes better when you add the green sauce they give you. Not sure what it is, but some sort of light green colored puree. It has a bit of spiciness and cilantro flavor. Perhaps very faint jalapeño. It was a bit messy when I found a lidless cup of sauce in my bag. There was no lid yet no sauce was spilled, like there's remains of a sauce but not necessarily a whole cup was spilled. Anyway, still messy. The container and utensils were a bit oily. No good for eating at my desk It came with plantains. Ironically my friend thought the sweet potatoes from my lunch the day before were plantains. Well now I really have plantains. I don't like how plaintains are too mushy sometimes but this one was good. There's a slight caramelized crust to it too which I appreciate. The color made me almost think these were chicken too There's a lot of beets. It amuses me how it makes everything pink and red. Tbh I don't eat enough beets to really say how this one is, but it seems quite fresh to me. It has a clear corn flavor - my friend confirmed beets can taste like this. I'm glad I didn't get sick of so many beets. The peas and green beans in the rice was blehh. It's fine but could be higher quality. The rice is orange. I wonder what they added. It's a bit salted and flavored. It's aight not oily not too salty. It's not as bad as it looks but I this isn't the type of thing I'd typically eat. Sorry not a fan 3.5",0
11913,"During a recent visit to Koreatown in New York, my friend and I dined at BARO. The restaurant charmed us with its cute aesthetic and lively atmosphere. However, our experience was marred by the excessively loud music at our table, and the staff's response to our concerns came across as slightly dismissive.

I opted for a rice bowl which turned out to be only passable. The freshness of the avocado and lettuce was notably lacking, forcing me to pick around these ingredients. Given the quality, I found the pricing to be steep and not reflective of the value.

While I might consider giving BARO another chance, I'd skip the vegetables and opt for takeout to avoid the lackluster service we encountered.",1
13613,"I came here on vacation, because I heard it was the best in Harlem ,so I had to give it a try! Overall it was good, I had the catfish meal with two sides. Greens and Mac and cheese which was really good. Everything was great I just wish my fish was crispier. Other than that it was good",0

1948,"Friday night, the wait might be around 20ish mins give or take but it is most definitely worth it. Loved everything we ordered which was the shrimp chang fen, a giant bowl of pork duck egg congee/jook, and Hong Kong classic milk tea. One cool thing is that the milk tea drink container is served in a bowl of shaved snow so that there's no need for ice floating inside your drink meaning more Hong Kong milk tea in the container. Amazing food that was very well flavored and great texture. This is most certainly a place I will return to.",0
3588,"Bar Suzette in Chelsea Market is a delightful little slice of Italy in NYC. The charm of having the option to savor dessert, a meal, and a drink all in one place is a treat for both locals and visitors. Seating is at a premium - it's limited but manageable. My companion and I were lucky enough to nab counter seats, so pro-tip: eat, enjoy, but don't linger too long as others are eyeing those coveted spots. We indulged in a delectable crepe brimming with Nutella, banana, and strawberries, which they courteously split for us. Whether you're passing by or looking for a quick, quality bite, Bar Suzette is worth the stop.",1
20340,"During our recent visit to the local Chinese eatery, we sampled a variety of dishes with generally pleasing results. The Shredded Pork with Bean Curd was a standout—a delectable dish with a well-balanced flavor that paired excellently with rice; it was thoroughly enjoyable. The Cumin Beef did not disappoint either, delivering a punch of spice and a burst of rich taste that left us savoring every bite.

However, the Soup Dumplings fell short of expectations. The thick skin detracted from the experience and there was a disappointing lack of the signature broth inside. Additionally, the flavor was unremarkable. Despite this misstep, our overall dining experience was delightful, thanks to the savory entrees.",1
10609,"Hey; I'm just here to join the party.  What more is there to say?  As a new guy in town, I took a scenic route on foot on the way to the NYPL near Bryant Park.  I had one idea in mind for lunch, and then I stumbled upon this place with no clue about how big of a deal this place is (except for the packed house).I went for broke and placed an order for each of the 4 tacos.  My favorite of the 4 was the adobada taco; I usually have high expectations for the pork taco because it's my favorite, and this definitely did not disappoint.  My least favorite taco was the cactus taco; the cactus taco just consisted of rubbery green something.  I honestly just wanted to see what a ""cactus taco"" was; at least now I know.Even though this place will always be a packed house, the line moves pretty quickly.  However, you may have trouble finding a place to stand and eat right away since eating space is always occupied.  With that said, I was kinda glad I was flying solo that day.Los Tacos No. 1 is the place for the  best tacos in NYC.  Easy 5 stars.",0

17168,"Title: A New Go-To for Late Night Dim Sum Cravings!

Finally discovered a fantastic late night spot for dim sum lovers! This place might not have the traditional push carts, but the easy-to-use laminated menus more than make up for it, offering a wide selection of classic dim sum delights alongside a variety of dishes typically found at non-dim sum Chinese eateries.

The quality of food here is impressive – each dim sum dish we tried was a hit, and the items from the regular menu were equally fresh and satisfying. The service deserves a special mention; our waiter was incredibly helpful and patient as we navigated through the extensive choices, making for a relaxed and enjoyable ordering experience.

The restaurant boasts spacious interiors with comfy booths, which added to the overall positive dining experience. The staff's accommodating nature shone through when they let us cozy up in a booth meant for six, even though it was just the two of us.

In summary, for those seeking both quality dim sum and excellent service, this is the spot to be. A definite must-try!",1
16247,"Ellen's is a fun place everyone should visit at least once. I love the concept. The servers are all aspiring actors and singers who are hoping to make it on to a Broadway stage. They not only serve your food, they also perform right there in the middle of the restaurant. They pass a bucket every so often and the money collected must be used for a singing, acting or dance lesson. In the past two years, 20 servers have left Ellen's because they were hired by a Broadway show! The food is typical diner food, and as expensive as anyplace else in New York. It's pretty good, but I wouldn't go just for the food. If you are a theater fan, and would like to support someone's dream of making it, you must go experience Ellen's. I will go at least once every time I visit the city!",0
16152,"Title: A Triumphant Return: ToNC Reclaims the Culinary Scene

After a mysterious hiatus, ToNC has made a triumphant return, much to the delight of its loyal followers. Gone are the cramped quarters of its original Manhattan Bridge-adjacent location, replaced by a spacious new venue that warmly welcomes diners.

The comparison to the famed Xi'an Famous Foods is inevitable, yet ToNC carves out its own niche with an authenticity that feels just a notch above XFF's Americanized twist. Despite the smaller portions, the flavors here are bold and satisfying. My dinner choice, the cumin lamb over hand-ripped noodles, didn't disappoint, boasting a balance of cilantro, jalapeño, and sautéed onions, though a tad more chili oil would have been welcome. The noodles' chewiness attested to their handmade authenticity.

The cumin lamb burger was another winner, its perfectly charred bun complementing the spiced lamb, while the onion added a welcome sweetness. The lamb skewers were a delightful appetizer that set the stage for the main course.

Ordering was a breeze, even without speaking the local dialect—proof that good food truly transcends language barriers. The staff's genuine care for their customers added to the experience, especially when the attentive owner personally ensured my noodles were well-mixed.

With its combination of mouthwatering food, affordable prices, and ample seating, ToNC is ripe for discovery by a wider audience—perhaps one celebrity visit away from a culinary explosion. I eagerly anticipate my next meal here and exploring more of what ToNC has to offer.",1
16245,A bit of an odd experience. The lunch prices are super cheap so why not go for that. I had the salt and pepper squid which was pretty average. . A little to deep fried and not so much salt and peppery. More oily. My buddy had the ma po tofu which I had a bite of and was much better. The lunch special comes with a very disappointing random bowl of luke warm chicken stock. The service started out good and then became less great as the meal went on. Oh and it started raining pretty heavily during the meal and the roof started leaking onto the floor. And no one did anything. It's not like that's gross or anything just...oh....that's an interesting development that no one is taking care of. I'm not convinced I'd like to go back but it is super cheap at lunch so give it a try.,0
1496,"Itsu is a fast-casual Asian (mostly Japanese) themed restaurant on the corner of 39 St and 7th Ave - someone in my NYC office recommended it and since it was around the corner I thought I would give it a whirl.The interior is modernist and very bright - there are multiple lines leading to registers where you can order hot food like dumplings or soup noodles - there's a long chilled case to the left of the entry where you can pick-up various sushi packages and just pay for them. The low-end packages feature veggie-nori and California rolls while the more pricy packaging has a bit of nigiri - the usual suspects like tuna and salmon. They also have packages with mostly salmon and other variations.Since I was expense-ing the lunch I opted for a bit more than I should have, grabbing one of the more expensive packages (had the most options in the rolls plus nigiri) and an udon bowl with port dumplings. The sushi was relatively fresh - probably put together that morning but I could see that it would need to be thrown out in the evening which seems to be SOP for most pick-up-and-go sushi. It was competently made and the sushi rice had the right amount of mirin (it always amazes me when sushi places get the rice wrong). Not the best sushi in the world but for a quick bite better than what you would find in a grocery store.The udon bowl reminded me a bit of the many udon stands you find in Tokyo lining the high-rises - there you would hold up your fingers indicating which one you wanted and by the time you got up to the counter you pay, walk away and start slurping. The udon here was of about the same quality - I thought the broth slightly watery/weak but not bad - probably adjusted to American tastes. It had an assortment of shredded veggies and edamame to keep things interesting but they were a bit distracting to me, even if they helped fill your belly with roughage. The dumplings were good if not great, more potsticker style than shumai but fairly tasty.Service was good and super fast but I did have to wait about 10 minutes for the food to come to my counter (I sat at one of the long counters being by myself and trying to be courteous to larger groups). I ended up adding a bit of the table gochujang and some sriracha to the soup to flavor it up a bit - something I usually don't do with Japanese style soups - but oh well. In general I liked the food and would visit again.",0
15753,"Classic bistro in West Village (right off Hudson) with a classic menu. Exposed bricks, wooden rustic tables... I would say they are certainly a classic American restaurant but they also have modern takes on traditional appetizers like chicken liver foie gras, steak tartare and oysters by the dozen. They call themselves a ""gastropub"" which I admittedly had to google and for anyone wondering its just a hybrid of a pub, bar and restaurant. Makes sense.I will say I was in the mood for a salad and they really didn't have much in that department - I looked at both the brunch and dinner menu and only found one (it was the same on both) which was a kale caesar, which is what I ordered. It wasn't bad, very simple, and came with shredded parmesan cheese and some croutons. I wouldn't have hated if they wanted to throw some cherry tomatoes in the mix. You can also add chicken or shrimp but I did not. The gal I was with ordered the squid ink linguine with seafood and ate the entire thing so you can assume it was good. We got a table right away just walking in on a Sunday which is also always a plus. Staff/servers were super friendly and the right amount of attentiveness.Last little thing I will say is I have a pet peeve about asking for lemon wedges so I can squeeze them in my water and I can't stand when they bring you the sliced lemon rounds because there is no way to squeeze them! The Warren isn't the only place that does this but thought I'd start calling it out because it needs to be said :)",0

14765,I've been wanting to come to this place for quite some time I added it to my bookmarks and it got buried under all the other interesting places that I bookmarked so I decided to take my girlfriend here Friday night and I was glad we finally made it. To enter into the lounge you have to take the elevator up stairs where you are greeted immediately by the amazing bar layout. The spot was a trendy dope spot with a lot of young people enjoying themselves and nice music atmosphere really made you want to talk and connect this is definitely a great place for a first date or reconnecting with a loved one or just spending some quality time having some good food and some good drinks. Seeing as it was kind a late we didn't really want much food so we just ordered the sweet and spicy wings with french fries. As you can see from the photo and the food looked amazing and it also tasted really good and the french fries were piping hot and crispy just the way I like them all in all the experience was nice the view outside was really cool especially if you have a window seat where you can look down onto 32nd St. and people watch or just check out the other spots that you would miss if walking by. As far as the drinks go they were really good I got the vanishing leprechaun and my girl got the gingery if I'm not mistaken i will definitely come back here to have drinks and some finger food.,0
36,"Title: A Delightful Tease of Flavors - Can't Wait for the In-Person Experience!

I recently ordered from this charming-looking restaurant via Seamless, opting for their Flambee Tarte with a gratinee topping of bacon, onions, and Gruyere cheese. The flavors were absolutely delicious and did not disappoint. However, a word of caution - this dish is not suited for casual bed dining, especially if you're nursing a hangover! The flambéed treat was a bit too messy for comfort, with its softness causing it to lose structure, resulting in a cheesy, albeit tasty, chaos on the hands.

The tarte, contrary to my expectations of it being akin to a flatbread pizza, featured a pleasantly thin breading. This made the meal seem lighter, yet it remained satisfyingly filling for two people. Despite the slight inconvenience, I am already looking forward to dining in and will be sure to share an updated review post my in-person experience. Highly recommend for those seeking a filling meal with a touch of finesse - just maybe not in bed!",1

The 8oz grill skirt steak was my favorite because of how tender it was. We did ask for the steak to be cooked medium and it came out pretty much well done. It was marinated perfectly but I loved the jeaw sauce that came on the side. The Thai iced tea was the added sweetness for my meal and it's only $1 with the yelp check in!

To share, started the evening with Skillet Brie & truffles. That had white truffles, honey truffle oil and homemade black bread. A bit on the smaller size. Dinner portions are quite hearty in size. My dining partner had the gnocchi basil pesto accompanied by Brussel sprouts and pistachios. Yes, little pillows of goodness. My choice turned out to be Thai Mussels. That came with a coconut milk, ginger and a basil sauce. This was very good. Even asked for more black bread to sop up the sauce at the end. No clunkers on this dish. All were open and ready for dipping in the Thai rice. For dessert a slice of kimura pie. Key lime, passion fruit custard.

15010,"Title: A Delightful Dining Experience at a Gorgeous Restaurant

From the moment we stepped into the restaurant, the stunning ambiance set the stage for what turned out to be a fabulous dining experience. Our server shone with attentiveness, particularly while guiding a sake novice like myself through the nuanced menu.

Our visit coincided with Restaurant Week and a birthday celebration, and it's safe to say the evening was a hit with everyone. The Restaurant Week cocktail seemed to be the star of the show, considering how many of us opted to try it.

The appetizers may have been on the smaller side, with my choice of tuna tartare standing out as a light, palate-stimulating option. However, any concerns about portion size were assuaged once we reached the main course. My steak, accompanied by shishito peppers and maitake mushrooms, was not only a generous serving but also a culinary marvel, bursting with flavors that truly delighted the taste buds.

Dessert followed in the same impressive footsteps—satisfying without being too heavy.

10787,"Title: Cozy Space with Delightful Ramen

My recent visit to this charming spot was a tale of contrasts. While the decor left me wanting—think cramped quarters and a handful of tables that hardly whisper 'comfort'—the culinary experience sang a different tune. Tucked by a window seat, sans the dreaded wait, I found solace in a bowl of superb ramen. A pleasing surprise was the pricing, which didn't wrestle with my wallet.

I'm torn about the space; it's part of its unique appeal yet a part that beckons for a spacious makeover. Would I recommend it? Absolutely, if you're nearby and craving good noodles. But for this Queens girl, it's no easy journey. So, while the ambience barely made a mark (2/5), the food and service were spot-on (5/5 each), making a return visit a definite possibility—proximity permitting.

Welcoming, friendly, attentive to the max.  Everyone we encountered provided top notch, unmatchable service from the time we walked inside.  I prefer tables away from others, and when I requested a cute table in a more private nook, they happily accommodated and even positioned the table so it was even more cozy and private than I originally requested.  The server was so informative, upbeat and friendly, accommodating my request to modify a seafood pasta dish with garlic and oil as well as black squid pasta instead of spaghetti.  The owner/ chef also came out and checked on us, asked how we liked everything; he was so friendly, welcoming - what incredible service!! Looking on Yelp, he is posted in countless photos, a testament to his commitment making customers happy and making them feel comfortable and welcome.  As I was taking photos of the beautiful restaurant, a sweet woman who ends up being the owner / chef's wife, took me on a little tour. Also so welcoming and friendly. I cannot rave enough about the outstanding service!Food.  Everything was beautifully presented and phenomenal. In fact, while I usually like to share a little, I was so consumed with the deliciousness of my modified homemade pasta  dish with seafood that I forgot to try my friends' dish.  - The Black squid pasta and the seafood (plump clams, mussels and lobster) were all perfectly cooked, amazing.- Burrata was colorful, Fabulously presented and delicious.  - Tuna tar tar- excellent.- Chocolate dessert was also beautifully presented and delicious.Ambiance. Another wow! Magical feeling with blue lights throughout. Beautifully decorated with fresh flowers and pretty rose arrangements.  Long tables perfect for larger parties, and smaller tables great for dates, including a couple private romantic nooks great for a date.  The back area where we sat has a large, amazing painting and chandelier as the backdrop, and is set apart from the main dining room area that has a blue light adorned tree and decor.  There is also a room downstairs great for a party of about 20 people.Loved Fabio's. Absolutely recommend for an amazing and memorable dining experience with friends, family, a group, or a date.",0
13686,"I had a delightful dining experience at this restaurant. The trout was perfectly prepared, paired with a side of the most velvety mashed potatoes I've ever tasted. The bratwurst was equally impressive – truly satisfying. Their beer selection complemented the meal beautifully. I'm definitely looking forward to returning.",1
1675,We were here on a sunday. The place was empty when we go here. We got the chicken with eggplant and garlic sauce and the pork juicy buns. Both tasted ok not the best ones and it is not cheap. Service was good.,0
15625,"Came here because we had a little get together since one of our friends came back to visit. We made reservations- table of 5. It does get packed so I highly recommend making reservations. We ordered a couple sides to share- mac cheese tart (pretty good), truffle mashed potatoes (my favorite side - delicious!!) and the brussel sprouts (not bad!). I got the lamb chops- juicy!  there was also sausage in my dish but it was kinda of dry. My friends got the chicken and thought it was a bit dry.Nice place to catch up with old friends - food is average.",0
3278,"Title: Cozy Spot with Hit-or-Miss Experiences

I visited this little restaurant before catching a nearby show on a bustling Saturday night. Its small size makes it unsuitable for large groups without advance notice. The staff's friendliness and thorough run-through of the daily specials were commendable. A friend ordered the evening's shrimp pasta special and enjoyed its tastiness. Unfortunately, my Prego Roll, despite sounding appealing with its garlic butter-infused skirt steak on a roll, fell short – the meat was tough and left my jaw aching. I'm open to returning for brunch, having heard positive reviews. Be advised, the place might not live up to its hype and could weigh heavier on your wallet than expected.",1
20787,"I've walked past this hidden gem of a deli at the Rockefeller Center subway station countless times and only just recently decided to stop in – what a mistake to have waited! Nestled near the revolving doors leading to the Rockefeller Concourse, it's easy to miss if you're not looking for it.

But once inside, it's a revelation. Although subterranean, the deli offers full-service with a variety of sandwiches, snacks, and drinks that could easily rival topside establishments. I've indulged in their breakfast sandwiches, which were impressive, setting the bar high for my future lunch visits. If you find yourself in the area, don't mimic my delayed discovery – it's well worth a visit.",1
3170,"I recently visited Angkor Cambodian Bistro for a Sunday supper and had high expectations for an authentic taste of Cambodia in the heart of Manhattan's Upper East Side. The restaurant itself is stunning, adorned with Asian artwork and statues, providing a romantic and private dining experience thanks to its thoughtful layout and ambient lighting. The dulcet tones of traditional pop music added to the serene atmosphere.

Our culinary journey at Angkor began with a serving of Fried Dumplings, priced at $10. Though they contained a mix of pork, shrimp, crab, and herbs, they unfortunately fell flat on taste. Moving to the main course, the Tamarind Duck, at $25, was the highlight with succulent roast duck and a decent sauce, yet the portion was disappointingly meager. A first-time trial of the Grilled Amok, which cost $26, left me underwhelmed; the fish was satisfactory, but the other seafood elements were overdone to the point of being rubbery.

For the prices, which were steep considering the portion sizes, I expected every dish to be a knockout. Sadly, this wasn't the case. On the upside, the service at Angkor was exemplary – our waitstaff was attentive and the bistro maintained an immaculate environment. Parking can be found nearby, but it's advisable to check the street signs meticulously.

In summary, Angkor Cambodian Bistro offers a beautiful ambiance and top-tier service that could make for a perfect date destination, yet when it comes to the fusion of cost, quantity, and taste, the restaurant leaves room for improvement.",1
13989,"Title: Disappointing Experience at Lombardi's, The Original NYC Pizza Falls Short

As a pizza aficionado eager to taste the slice that started it all, my visit to Lombardi's was high on anticipation but, unfortunately, low on delivery. Despite its claim to fame as the original New York City pizzeria, I found the quality drastically lagging behind numerous other local spots.

Upon arriving late on a Friday evening, the service was prompt, as we quickly found ourselves seated in the bustling establishment. One caveat for future visitors: Lombardi's operates on a cash-only basis, although an ATM is provided on the premises.

Our order consisted of a classic Margherita pizza, priced at $25, and a side of breadsticks for $10. However, both items proved to be a letdown. The breadsticks were dense and overly doughy, lacking any texture or flavor that would invite another bite. As for the pizza, the crust was disappointingly bland and suffered from a floppy, cardboard-like consistency. The sauce didn't save the day either, betraying a bitter taste that didn't mesh well with the rest of the ingredients.

A peculiar touch for a sit-down restaurant was the provision of paper plates, which seemed at odds with the dining setting and added to the overall lackluster experience.

In all honesty, I cannot recommend Lombardi's to those seeking an authentic and tasty ""NYC-slice."" For a superior pizza experience, consider visiting Juliana's, Prince St. Pizza, Adrienne's Pizza Bar, or even a 99 cent pizza place, all of which promise a more satisfying bite of the Big Apple.

Rating: 2/5 – Save your appetite and your dollars for a better slice elsewhere.",1
14618,"Title: A Delightful Encounter with Filipino Flavors at Jeepney

My boyfriend and I capped off a day of adventure by visiting Jeepney, a much-anticipated Filipino culinary spot. Eager and famished, we opted for the bar seating, which proved to be spacious and thoughtfully equipped with outlets—a small, yet appreciated detail.

The ambiance is inviting with vibrant decor and music that adds a universal touch of joy. It's advisable to book ahead for larger groups, as the place fills up quickly. The staff, from bartender to servers, radiated enthusiasm and attentiveness, enhancing the overall experience.

The gastronomic highlight was the sisig tacos - a must-try that tantalized our taste buds. The garlic rice matched the tacos in its deliciousness. The pancit malabon boasted great flavors, though my satiety limited my capacity for full enjoyment. Meanwhile, my boyfriend relished the pork diniguan, deeming it exceptional.

Happy hour was a cherry on top, with $4 beers and $8 daiquiris. Jeepney won us over; we're already planning a return for the communal joy of a Kamayan style dinner with family. A gem not to be missed!",1
20732,"Title: A Symphony of Flavors at Pho-nomenal!

From the very first spoonful, I knew I had stumbled upon something special. The beef noodle soup was a revelation, with a depth of flavor that promised a slow-cooked, heart-warming experience. The chicken broth pho followed suit, a delicate balance of spices and fresh herbs dancing in a light, yet savory broth. 

The cha gio (Vietnamese fried spring rolls) were a crispy delight, their crunchy exteriors giving way to a tasty, well-seasoned filling. And let's not overlook the fried Brussels sprouts – an unexpected star of the show. These little green gems were transformed into a crave-worthy dish with the perfect combination of char and seasoning.

In short, this dining experience was nothing short of delightful. From start to finish, each dish was cooked to perfection and packed with authentic flavor. A truly memorable meal.",1
11121,"I recently had the pleasure of dining at this gem of a restaurant for a business lunch and was thoroughly impressed. Despite not having a reservation, I was accommodated without any wait. The service was exceptional—friendly, prompt, and welcoming.

For my meal, I chose the brick pressed chicken paired with asparagus and a wine reduction. The dish was bursting with flavor, the chicken perfectly moist with a delightfully crispy skin that set it apart. I also indulged in their much-talked-about fries, and they lived up to their reputation—absolutely delicious.

I'm already planning my next visit to explore more of their offerings, especially after spotting their enticing happy hour menu. This spot is definitely on my list for a return visit.",1
12363,"This review is for their fried chicken on a cheddar waffle. Well, I don't think I've ever tried a chicken and waffle like this and my friend recommended it to me as a must-try during my visit to the Chelsea market.The chicken was super crispy and they give you such a large amount. The cheddar waffle is extremely crispy on the outside yet soft and gooey on the inside. You can really taste the saltiness of the cheddar and it gives the texture of the waffle a special crack and crunch when you eat it. They give you syrup and Tabasco sauce on the side to really spice up the flavors, all topped with a sprinkle of chives.Honestly, this is one of their best options on the menu. Me and my boyfriend split one just to try it and while it is a bit pricey, I definitely think it's worth it as some of the best food in Chelsea market.",0
10542,"Title: A Serendipitous Culinary Delight at Mughlai

Last night's gastronomic adventure began as an accident but turned into a feast for the senses at Mughlai, located just a stone's throw from Vida Verde. Our party of four, ravenous post-happy hour, was drawn in by irresistible aromas and promptly seated despite the bustling crowd.

The culinary journey kicked off with a complimentary appetizer, courtesy of the gracious owner—a gesture that won us over instantly. The dish was so delectable we found ourselves ordering extra naan just to savor every drop of the exquisite sauce.

Our main courses didn't disappoint either. The fish was sumptuous, but the chicken tikka masala stole the show. I requested it extra spicy and was rewarded with a unique blend of heat and sweetness that danced on the palate. The boneless lamb was another standout, tender and bursting with flavor.

The attentive staff ensured our dining experience was nothing short of exceptional. Mughlai has etched itself in our minds and taste buds—I'm already looking forward to our next visit.",1
15031,This is one of the restaurants right off Doyers where they have sectioned off the road for outdoor dining. It specializes in hand pulled and knife cut noodles. They have the noodles in soup or stir fried forms with your choice of meat. All dishes come with a bit of greens in them. Super tasty place!,0
2668,"A very busy Korean gastropub that takes some unique dishes and some Korean stalwarts and serves it on very small tables. The space is busy, with a wait on a Wednesday night. The service was very abrupt, seating us and the server dropped water on the table and disappeared for a while. Super noisy restaurant, though, very hard to hold a conversation across the table even as small as they were.We tried:- Crunchy tofu - not great, could have done with being less hard and dry, though the kimchi to the side was cool and refreshingly light- Fried Tiger roll was too creamy/thick paste like in consistency. Also oily.- The Popcorn Chicken done in a fryer basket was probably the best dish of the night, didn't even need the sauce.- The japchae was ok, seafood version is lightly spicy, and I like the mini squid/octopus pieces- The hotstone bowl of bulgogi was again ok, but lacked the variety of veggies that I'd get elsewhere and had too much rice.Overall, so-so food, too noisy to talk, and too busy for me to come back.",0
10127,"Title: A Brunch to Remember at Tenth Ave

I recently enjoyed my first visit to Tenth Ave for a girls' brunch, and it was an absolute delight. This charming spot exudes cuteness and warmth, thanks to the incredibly welcoming staff who greet you with constant smiles. Service was impressively swift, ensuring a seamless dining experience.

We took full advantage of the hour and a half sangria and mimosa special, which complemented our meal perfectly. The variety of dishes at our table - from the zesty ceviche and fresh salad to the perfectly cooked salmon and the flavorful chimi burger - were thoroughly enjoyed by all. My choice, the shrimp linguine, was a standout with its perfect blend of flavors.

A special shoutout to our bartender, Joanna, who was the life of the party! Her fun spirit and the shots and laughs we shared with her made our brunch extra special. Tenth Ave has certainly won us over with its great hospitality, and we can't wait to return for more good times.",1
13279,"We came here for RW lunch, but Nougatine also offers a weekday 3 course prix fixe lunch on the regular.  Wanting to cover all our bases, we ordered one of each.Surprisingly, we enjoyed the RW lunch more, highlighting the fact that more expensive doesn't always mean better.Restaurant week Lunch prix fixe $26- Chilled cucumber yogurt soup with grilled shrimp:  Lovely presentation.  The soup was refreshing on a hot summer day.  The shrimp still had the poop tract intact.  Gross.  A blunder for a higher end restaurant, I'd think.- Corn nut crusted flounder: Well done!  The fish was cooked perfectly, and that corn nut crust was so crispy.  Very nice texture contrast.  Loved the corn emulsion too.Lunch prix fixe $44- Tuna tartare: Beautiful presentation and equally delicious.- Black Sea bass: The skin on the sea bass was soggy.  Maybe it had been sitting too long before it arrived at our table?  The best item on the dish was the side of uber creamy potato puree and basil vinagrette.  I could have just eaten that and done without the fish.- Apricot tart with marzipan ice cream:  Meh.  Again, the main star of the dish was ok but pales in comparison to it's sidekick: the ice cream.  If you like the taste of marzipan, this is not to be missed.Service was impeccable. 5/5So all in all, some hits and some misses.  I'd go back for RW, but I don't think I'd make it a mandatory stop on my next visit otherwise.",0
3010,"Great place! Great food! Outstanding service! Dynamite salad bar! Delicious cheese bread! Awesome meat selection! Yummy sides. Good dessert.You will eat, eat, eat until your heart and tummy are satisfied. Strongly suggest making a reservation. Great place to visit before or after a Broadway, or off Broadway show. Located a few feet away from the E & C 50th street station. There is also a parking lot across. The restaurant is Adjacent to the New World stage theater. Food is worth the high price point but I suggest taking advantage of restaurant week, and it is also $20 at 20 for off Broadway shows, so treat yourself/ reward yourself, or just because you want good food. How does it work? Make a reservation, arrive, be seated, select as many sides as you like that are included,  so pick 1,2 or all, go to the salad bar as often as you like, when you return to your table  your bread will be waiting. Once you are done eating from the salad bar flip your coasters to the green side, and the waiters will continue to bring meat offerings, as your sides arrive at the table consecutively. They will continue to bring meat to your table until you flip your coaster to red, which means stop. Multiple meat choices, ribs, lamb, steak, chicken pork... don't forget dessert. Very pretty but comfortable venue, clean restrooms and quality service. We will return soon.",0
18545,"Came here with my friend after wanting to try it out for ages. We were seated fairly quickly which was nice but they put us in a corner with an extremely loud group where we couldn't even hear each other over the noise. We asked our waiter and they were more than kind enough to move us to a better area which was definitely appreciated, especially since it was a busy evening for them. We checked the menu and everything seemed quite pricey but thats expected for most kbbq. We decided on the large beef combination platter which was $126.99 since our waiter told us that should be enough for 2 people (which seemed ridiculous to me since that being their largest I would expect it to feed 3-4). We also got the Frozen Mango Bomb - $16 which was 100% worth it. Our meat finally came out and I got my first shock, they apparently don't have any banchan with their food. Thats one of the best parts of kbbq!! Then the meat finally came and while they were quality meat, the portion and flavor was definitely not worth the price in my opinion. Literally at the end of the meal it was ~$80 for each of us for 1 combo which only slightly filled us and 1 drink. I might be spoiled by queens but honestly feel like the pricing is a major overkill. Overall, staff 4/5 - kind and receptive but I'm guessing due to language barrier not too helpful with recommendationsFood - 3/5 - quality was adequate but portion sizes definitely were not for their biggest combo or the pricePricing - 1/5 - definitely didnt think it was worth how much our food came out to.",0
12600,"Got KazuNori delivered via Postmates for the first time and it was amazing. The rolls are cut, and each was more delicious than the last. The crab and shrimp are still my favorites, but the toro (tuna) and salmon are also fabulous. Salmon sashimi was perfect too.  I'll be dreaming of the next time I can have that crab roll!",0
13741,"Be warned: the service here is pretty bad! If the food weren't so good this would easily be a one star restaurant. The sad part was it was my birthday and I was hoping for a spectacular experience!We saw our waiter 3 times the entire meal. To take our order, once while eating and then when we got the check. We got the pasta tasting menu and they brought our food out so sporadically. Our first 3 came out within 5 mins of each other and then the last 3 had a 20 minute gap between each dish. It was really frustrating rushing through 3 course and then having the rest come out so slowly. You might be thinking the wait is nice for digesting, but the restaurant was so hot! It was like the AC was broken. I had to take layers off and I was still sweating. After the first 3 courses I was full and sweating. Not a great combination... It really ruined the last 3 dishes. If you notice I only have 3 pictures because I was so turned off I stopped recording the meal. Tonnarelli Cacio e Pepe - really good. great pepper flavorsRicotta Gnocchi with Sausage & Fennel - gnocchi's cooked perfectly and went really well with the sauceBucatini All'Amatriciana - flavors were amazing!Spaghetti alla Carbonara - really good and creamy. simple dish done really well. Pajata Finta - rigatoni was cooked well and once again great flavorsSorbetto - great pallet cleanser. Very simple. They threw a candle in there for my birthday, but on point with their poor service they gave it to the wrong person. So food probably 5 stars. Service definitely 1 star.",0

10085,"Any place you can add a side of fried chicken is my kind of place. We stayed nearby, and ate breakfast here on my birthday. I have no complaints (about Egg Shop*...I have lots of complaints, generally). The staff is lovely, the space is cozy, the vibe is good, and the food is on point.I got the seriously tasty BEC, an excellent bloody mary, and a side of fried chicken (happy birthday to me). The latter comes already doused in honey and with the house hot sauce, it's delicious. My wife misguidedly got some kind of beautiful but slightly healthy egg dish that had beet juice colored eggs and vegetables (gross), and even that was delicious. And get this, she didn't even get a side of fried chicken (amateur) and stole some of mine (dirty thief). All in all a little too expensive, but a very nice place to eat some eggs. I'd definitely do it again._____________*Wait, I have one complaint about Egg Shop. There's a wait when I want to eat here. They are signed up for Yelp Waitlist which is amazing and would solve the problem...but they don't appear to use it, which is not amazing, and it remains a problem.",0

2847,"Title: Village Square Pizza: A True NYC Gem

Review:

Don't let the countless claims of 'best pizza in NYC' fool you, Village Square Pizza genuinely deserves the accolade. From their impressive selection, the white slice drizzled with extra hot honey stands out — it's a must-try. This hot honey isn't spicy; instead, it's a sublime touch of sweet to the savory that elevates every bite. The place also scores with its ambiance; a friendly staff serving up slices to the beats of early 2000s hip-hop creates a vibe that's as delightful as their pizza. If you find yourself craving exceptional pizza in a dope spot, Village Square is the place to be.",1
11062,"I was really excited to try out this place especially for their bourbon pancakes. What a disappointment! The food and the service was horrible. The waiter didnt even provide half of our table glasses to drink water. We had to ask for it and he got it for us 30 minutes later. He took our order after a LONG TIME. We got our drinks but our food came another 30 minutes later. And my pancakes tasted like well, plain bland pancakes. No smell or taste of bourbon. I asked for extra syrup and the bus boy nodded confused and brought the waiter later asking what I wanted so I told him more syrup. He said sure but never got it I complained to the manager about the non bourbon tasting pancake and he offered to get me anything on the menu. I politely refused cause I was already disappointed. I told him about the syrup and he got it for me. The waiter also took forever to get my check. I paid for all my bland tasting food and left very disappointed.",0
17413,"Average pizza. Another quarantine try. They used to have a $10 large cheese pie, not anymore. This made it more desirable. Garlic knots were large and probably the worst I've ever had. Will avoid them in the future. The pizza is likely to get more tries due to quarantine. Staff is friendly.",0
11679,"Title: Charming Themed Dining with a Side of Disappointment

Upon entering this charmingly themed restaurant, the delightful decor and staff attire immediately set a promising stage for a memorable dining experience. The service, while adequate, wasn't the highlight of the evening. Generous portion sizes impressed, ensuring that we left with full bellies and no room for more.

However, the evening wasn't without its flaws. Despite it being only 6 pm, the kitchen was already out of several menu items, diminishing the excitement of our group of six. This shortfall sadly overshadowed the restaurant's appealing atmosphere and led to a general feeling of letdown.

Though the restaurant has many positives, the experience was tainted by the limited availability of dishes. Given the early shortage of popular items and the resulting disappointment, a return visit seems unlikely.",1
18867,"I've been motivated to try plant-based foods and discover new flavors. I decided to come here given great reviews I heard from friends and colleagues. My first impressions were that the place is very cute and clean. It took me a while to decide what to get, but I chose the quinoa taco salad and a small mac and cheese. The salad was a pretty generous portion and looked beautiful. I really enjoyed the seitan chorizo, it had a delicious seasoning. I could taste the ingredients were very fresh as well. The mac and cheese was a great surprise: I was impressed with how creamy the sauce was and the shiitake bacon was very interesting! My party also ordered the pesto pasta (amazing!), spicy thai salad (I loved the flavor combinations), classic burger (great sandwich) and chicky chicky (least impressive, in my opinion, I felt it a bit oily). I particularly loved the beet ketchup and the aioli, which you can get as much as you like. In the end, my husband decided to try their chocolate dairy free ice cream - this was incredible! Being someone who loves ice cream but is also very sensitive to dairy, I know where to go for my next craving. I found out that their dairy free ice cream is actually made from a mix of coconut, cashew, almond and hazelnut - probably why it is so creamy but with no after taste (common with coconut base ice cream). Will definitely come back to try other items on the menu!",0
14209,"I had the pleasure of dining at this restaurant right on the cusp of pandemic closures, celebrating a close friend’s birthday. Starting on a positive note, the attention to hygiene was commendable with mandatory hand sanitizer use upon entry. We came with a group of 10 and, despite our reservation, experienced a prolonged wait before being seated, which was a dampener.

Once we settled in, the starters and drinks, including empanadas and sangria, set a good stage for the meal to follow. The entrées didn’t keep us waiting long and turned out to be the highlight – think perfectly cooked salmon, flavorful yellow rice, beans, and plantains that hit all the right notes in taste and portion size.

A word of caution, the restaurant is quite remote, so it’s not the most accessible without your own wheels. Overall, the experience was a mix of minor inconveniences and culinary triumphs.",1
1607,"Title: Mixed Feelings at a Seasonal Spot

I recently visited a local restaurant for drinks with my sister and aunt to celebrate the Lunar New Year. We were lucky to secure a spot in the outdoor area, which, despite being winter, was comfortably warmed and sheltered. However, a plastic covering obstructed what could have been a lovely view.

Our drink experience was hit-or-miss. My choice, 'The Perfect Pear,' was underwhelming and seemed diluted, lacking any real pear essence. The decorative cinnamon stick failed to impart its flavor, leaving me questioning its purpose. My aunt's dark concoction, the name of which escapes me, was also disappointing. As someone who usually enjoys dark liquors, it failed to meet my expectations. On the other hand, my sister was pleased with her choice, though I can't recall its name.

We didn't explore the food menu during this visit, but past experiences have left me considering it average and not quite justifying the price. This setting might suit a date night for a casual drink, perhaps accompanied by a simple snack like fries, but it wouldn’t be my first choice for a girls' night out or a gourmet meal.",1
12983,"Attended a fantastic work holiday party at this gem of a restaurant where both the wine and beer pours were generous and impressive. Our group had a blast, thanks in no small part to the exceptionally attentive bartenders.

This place left a lasting impression, and I'm eager to return!",1

It was really delicious and a large, but manageable portion. It came with perfectly prepared jasmine rice. We order Indian regularly and I'll say that their garlic naan, that we ordered on the side, was a larger portion than average. Our food was very good and was pretty easy on the tummy, which is great because Indian food can be pretty buttery and heavy. I'd definitely order again!",0
3095,"Title: A Mixed Bag at the Soup Spot

My recent visit to this bustling restaurant on a Friday night was a somewhat uneven experience. Anticipating a swift serving of the traditional seollong tang, I was surprised by the longer-than-expected wait time, considering soups are typically a staple prepared in advance. Once served, the soup was satisfying in its smoothness, although the portion appeared deceptively small; it proved to be quite filling. Nevertheless, the dish was light on ingredients, with sparse beef pieces amidst the rice and noodles, suggesting diners may want to order additional items for a more substantial meal.

My companion's choice of cheese dolsotkimchi was less successful, with the sauce proving excessively robust and necessitating an extra bowl of rice to achieve a more palatable balance. The side of kimchi, freshly cut and seasoned at the table, provided a memorable touch with its unique presentation and flavor profile.

Despite the crowd, the restaurant efficiently managed seating, although communication mishaps led to a longer wait time than initially quoted. Overall, the dining experience totaled about two hours, factoring in the wait for both seating and meal service. While the restaurant shows promise with its authentic offerings and lively atmosphere, timing and execution leave room for improvement.",1
12731,"Came here for dinner with my sister and her best friend. First off, I want to say the hostess had a nasty attitude...my sister and I were waiting for a good amount of time, asked to be seated so that we could order appetizers as we wait for our third person. She said no, that we had to wait for her and I asked if we could sit at the bar, and she sighed and said yeah I guess so...I honestly would have left if she said no. Anyways, so we finally sit by the bar, started off with the pork belly bun and the peking duck taco. Both of them were pretty good but I must say for the price, it wasn't worth it. The pork belly I had was 99.9% fat which was a bit upsetting. The sauce was good though. The peking duck taco was really good but for $6 for one, was upsetting, it was really small. We also tried the chicken appetizer, it was good but a bit too spicy for me. I ordered the chicken ramen and it was good, I can't complain. My sister had the tonkotsu which she also enjoyed but was upset that she could've ordered the small instead of large. The waiter steered us in the wrong direction! My sister's friend ordered the tantan, which she thought was good but was surprised it tasted more like a thai dish than a ramen dish (probably because of the curry sauce-too thick). The price was pretty reasonable, the waiter was nice and attentive.",0
15940,"Food: 2/5Ordered grilled skirt steak with rice and chicken milanese with mashed potatoes. Both dishes were just mediocre. The grilled skirt steak was just ok and the portion was a bit skimpy.

The food wasn't spectacular and I left feeling like I overpaid.Service: 4/5We sat at the bar. The bartender was very nice but she had a very heavy accent. I had a difficult time communicating with her.Ambiance: 2.5/5Nothing special about this place. Sort of felt like an Italian restaurant.Two entrees, two martinis plus tax and tip = $100.

19453,"Stumbled upon this gem while on the hunt for an afternoon snack and the Taiwanese popcorn chicken did not disappoint. At just $4.90, my boyfriend and I enjoyed a generous portion of fresh, succulent, and perfectly breaded chicken - hot from the fryer. The homemade Thai sweet chili sauce was the star, offering a unique and tantalizing twist. While the lingering fried aroma was a minor drawback, this casual, hole-in-the-wall cafe with free WiFi is a find. Definitely, a go-to spot for affordable and delicious bites.",1
17229,"I can see why people can't stop talking about the carbonara. It was both fantastic to look at and to eat! I unfortunately could only have a small taste because of how dense and cheesy it was. We also split the rabbit pasta which was very well done. We actually liked the rabbit pasta a little more; it's less famous but on the lighter side compared to the carbonara and just as delicious. I'm sure all of their pastas are fantastic. The ambience here is also worth stopping by for. Overall, a fantastic option for Italian food if you're a local or visitor of NYC.",0
17711,"I recently ventured out to Estela, a small plates restaurant that I'd never imagined myself visiting until a persistent suggestion from a friend in Sydney prompted me to give it a try. Despite my reservations, I booked a brunch spot for two at 12pm on a Sunday via Resy without a hitch, even on short notice.

The cozy interior of Estela charmed me, although the quaintness of the space meant navigating a rather small cafe table which barely accommodated our selection of shared dishes. Following the waiter's advice, we opted for three plates instead of the suggested four to five, and found ourselves pleasantly sated.

Our culinary journey began with a burrata on grilled bread, bathed in a salsa verde with a hint of basil—a delightful if somewhat predictable start. The main affair included ricotta and mushroom dumplings, which my companion enjoyed despite an unexpected raw mushroom topping. My choice of grilled turbot was competently prepared, though the simplicity of the dish left me feeling that I could replicate the meal at home.

Service was amiable with no particular issues, though the kitchen's pace lagged despite the restaurant being less than bustling. While I'm not ruling out a return visit, possibly for dinner, my initial foray into Estela left me yearning for the Michelin-starred spark that I had hoped would elevate the experience from satisfactory to extraordinary.",1
20206,"We were fooled by the pics that the restaurant posted on Yelp so we thought we'd try it.  The food does NOT look anything like those pictures.  And it tastes worse than it looks.  To add insult to injury, the service is terrible.  The only recognizable course (besides rice and soup for obvious reasons) was the crawfish. Unfortunately they offered no utensils or small fork to remove them from the shell and they were really stuck in there.  We tried everything.  Finally it came to hands and forks.  We asked for wet naps or a finger bowl of lemon water and our server had no clue what we were talking about.  There was zero attention to detail.  Anything that came on a plate was tossed on there.... no presentation.  Drippings and crumbs everywhere.  We were there for 3 hours and we were begging them to hurry.  This nightmare experience is going to cost you too.  $$$$.",0
20073,"I recently ordered takeout from this spot and overall, I was pleased with my meal. The guacamole and chips were a solid starter - fresh and satisfying. I particularly enjoyed the carne asada tacos, thanks to their flavorful marinade. However, the grilled fish tacos were a letdown; the fish was dry, resulting in a bland experience. The chicken tamale also didn't hit the mark for me due to its texture and temperature. On a positive note, the sweet potato fries were good, although next time I'd skip the cheese. Despite the few misses, the positives were enough to ensure I'd order from here again.",1
18502,"Title: A Gem in West Village - French Cuisine at Its Finest

From the moment one steps into this West Village sanctuary, it's clear that an exceptional French culinary experience awaits. Nestled on a serene corner, the restaurant welcomes guests with an ambiance reminiscent of a quaint Parisian café, further enhanced by the tender glow of a summer evening's natural light.

The service breaks from the Paris stereotype, offering a warmth and ease akin to a newfound friend with whom you'd share a wine-soaked evening under the stars. The staff is attentive, approachable, and unpretentious, setting the stage for an evening where the food truly sings.

The hors d'oeuvres, boasting both simplicity and freshness, set a high bar that the follow-up acts meet with grace. True to its name, ""Boucherie,"" the meat dishes are indeed the pièce de résistance. The duck and lamb arrive cooked to perfection, each sauced and garnished so thoughtfully that the accompaniments share the spotlight with the main fare.

Desserts - a classic chocolate mousse and a flawless crème brûlée - provide the quintessential sweet finale to a faultless meal.

For anyone in pursuit of unparalleled French cuisine and a delightful dining experience - this is your place. Without hesitation, it earns my recommendation and a promise for a return visit. #NYCRestaurantWeek",1
2085,"Title: A Slice of NYC Vibe with a Pastrami Surprise!

In a city teeming with revered pizza joints, this spot had been on my radar, promising an experience divergent from the typical upscale pizzeria. Walking in, the ambiance is more akin to a laid-back bar than a fancy pizza place, clearly aiming for that authentic New York City hangout atmosphere.

The star of the show? The pastrami pizza. Touted as a fan favorite, it did not disappoint. Deviating from traditional red sauce, this innovative pie is slathered with a tangy mustard sauce that perfectly complements the salty pastrami - a topping that seems to prove its versatility yet again, providing a delightful alternative to other cured meats like prosciutto.

Each bite is a harmonious blend of robust flavors - the pastrami's intense savoriness paired with the sharp mustard, all mellowed by the soft, chewy dough. It's an ingenious deconstruction of a classic pastrami sandwich, transformed into a pizza.

While we sampled other offerings such as the Margherita, none quite left the lasting impression as the pastrami did. For anyone looking to break the mold of traditional pizza toppings, this place is a must-visit - a testament to culinary creativity and a nod to the ever-evolving tastes of New York City.",1
10870,"Title: A Surprisingly Delectable Asian Cuisine Encounter

I'm typically not one for Asian cuisine, but my recent dining experience at this establishment has left me pleasantly surprised and eager to return. They offer an incredibly affordable tasting menu at $46, which includes three hearty dishes complemented by a side of white rice. For a minor upgrade of $2, one can indulge in a specially seasoned rice, though the standard offerings are more than satisfactory.

While premium items like sea urchin and lobster do come at an additional charge, I found the regular menu items to be thoroughly satisfying without the need for costly add-ons. The service was commendable and the immaculate bathroom facilities deserve a mention.

Standouts for me included the yellowfin tuna, crab, steak tartare, pork and shrimp, octopus, and galbi. Although the sea urchin was a hit with my companions, I would personally skip the pricier options next time. All in all, this restaurant is a testament to the delicious possibilities of Asian cuisine, even for those unsure about its flavors.",1
16242,"I recently dined at this local gem known for their dumplings, and I must say, they do not disappoint. The pork dumplings were incredibly savory and juicy, with just the right meat-to-skin ratio – the thin, delicate skin ensuring every bite was a pleasure, not doughy at all. I had both the boiled and fried dumplings and at $4 for 8 pieces, it felt like an absolute steal. The homemade chili oil deserves a special mention—it's a flavor explosion with a distinct star anise aroma that elevates the dumplings to a whole new level. Highly recommended for an authentic, tasty, and budget-friendly experience!",1
18790,"Title: A Delightful, Unexpected Find after Museum Adventures

Having spent the afternoon immersed in espionage history at the nearby spy museum, my friend and I were struck by an insatiable craving for tacos. Our first choice was packed, which led us serendipitously to the welcoming doorstep of Tacuba.

As we settled in, I indulged in the Mezcalita de Piña for two – an audacious yet satisfying decision, as the cocktail, whimsically served in a pineapple, proved delightful. The ceviche that followed was a vibrant dance of freshness on the palate, hitting all the right citrusy notes without overpowering its delicate seafood.

The main event, octopus & chorizo tacos, arrived with much fanfare. Flavorful and well-composed, these delicacies were savored, despite their modest size.

The ambiance of Tacuba is intimate—the kind of dimly lit charm conducive to a romantic evening. A tip for future patrons: secure a reservation to fully relish the experience without the gentle nudge from the attentive staff, who, while accommodating, may usher you through your culinary journey with subtle haste.

In conclusion, Tacuba is a gem worth the detour, especially for those looking for post-museum refreshments with a side of ambiance.",1
19556,"Title: A Toss-Up Experience at an Average NYC Ramen Joint

I recently dined at a ramen spot in NYC that could best be described as average. For starters, I tried the takoyaki and gyoza, priced at $5 each, which were decent and met my expectations. However, the main course, fried chicken curry ramen, left much to be desired. The addition of cold corn and a half egg detracted from the warmth of the dish, and the reveal of pre-packaged noodles instead of fresh, handmade ones was a disappointment. On the upside, the service was impeccable, with attentive staff ensuring our water was never empty and our food arrived promptly, earning a solid 5/5. The ambiance was quite pleasant too, scoring a 4/5 with its welcoming vibe.

Food: 3/5

17162,"I recently had the pleasure of dining at a local restaurant that offers an incredible value for dry pot enthusiasts. The portions they serve are impressively large, ensuring a satisfying meal. The restaurant has a unique system that allows diners to visually select the ingredients for their pot, which I found particularly helpful in customizing our meal.

Our food arrived promptly after ordering, which was a delightful surprise given the bustling atmosphere. The seating arrangement is spacious and well-suited for large groups, making it an ideal spot for family gatherings or dinners with friends.

In addition to dry pot, their menu boasts a variety of other tempting dishes, including succulent dumplings and a perfectly balanced sweet and sour pork. This establishment stands out as a fantastic alternative to Mala Project, and I highly recommend it for anyone in search of generous portions, swift service, and a convivial dining environment, all at a reasonable price.",1

We indulged in a variety of dishes including succulent shrimp dumplings, fluffy steamed pork buns, and a medley of fresh vegetables, all of which you can glimpse in the attached photos. Each dish was definitely delicious and masterfully prepared.

The only quirk to note is that small parties may be seated with complete strangers, which can feel a bit unconventional at first. However, that did nothing to diminish the overall amazing experience. Based on the quality of the food and the authenticity of the cuisine, I will definitely be returning for another round of their delightful offerings.",1

After a day of anticipation and multiple calls to secure a spot, my dining companion and I arrived at the restaurant at 9:30pm on a Saturday. It was my inaugural hot pot experience paired with all-you-can-eat BBQ, and it did not disappoint. We indulged for a solid 90 minutes, a stark contrast to previous Korean BBQ outings that left my wallet lighter and my stomach wanting more.

The variety on offer was impressive, with every item exuding freshness. While the BBQ itself fell short of our flavor expectations, a quick dip into our hot pot after grilling added the needed zest. As self-proclaimed spice aficionados, the kimchi and spicy hot pots didn't pack the heat we hoped for, but thanks to a well-stocked sauce bar, I customized my broth to achieve the perfect fiery taste.

Service was outstanding—waitstaff were diligent in their meat preparation and frequently swapped out grills, ensuring each bite was smoke-free and not tinged with burn. Eager to revisit, I would certainly recommend this spot to others looking for a generous hot pot and BBQ experience.",1

The buttered scallop also deserves a special mention for its sublime flavor. Our heartfelt thanks to the chef for an unforgettable dining adventure.",1

19609,"I'd give it like a 3.5 stars tbh. The good taste good and quality was decent but way too salty and most dishes were too oily. I was so thirsty after and a bit hard to swallow. They forgot my friend's rice but brought it to him right after he asked for it and was nice about us splitting the bills. The attitude are good although could be a bit more attentive. The wait is usually not too bad, we waited 10-15mins when the other smaller restaurant's wait time was 45mins. A few tables and seats, longer tables so if you are alone or by pairs you will be sitting with other customers. The decorations inside is quite simple but it's elegant and comfortable, relaxing even. The noise level is medium but not great if you have hearing problems. Since both of my friend have hearing problems, they were having a little bit of a hard time during the conversation so we had to text it. Otherwise, I thought the noise wasn't bad at all. Nice ambience and quite a few options for food and drinks. The portion was good but I personally think it's a bit over priced for what it have to offer. Not a bad place at all if you like heavy flavoured foods and if your stomach can take spicy and very oily foods. However, if you can, most dishes here might not suit you. Personally, I would come back but I'd said check it out if you can take strong food.",0
1742,"CUT by Wolfgang Puck, nestled in the Four Seasons Hotel in New York's Financial District, offers a taste of its Michelin-starred Beverly Hills counterpart. While it doesn't quite match the original's fame or star-studded clientele, the New York establishment holds its own with a commendable culinary experience. For a cozier and livelier ambiance, I recommend dining in the bar area where you can enjoy selections from both the bar and full dining room menus, as opposed to the more subdued and often underpopulated formal dining room. CUT stands out as a solid choice for those seeking a more relaxed yet upscale dining experience.",1

19396,"I accidentally came across a sign with ""Joju coming soon"" one morning while walking a different route to work. Since that day, I have been patiently waiting for JoJu to finally open up in midtown. I have been to their Elmhurst queens location before and loved the food there. For those who never heard of this place, JoJu specializes in ""modern vietnamese sandwiches"". This is because they bring in other Asian fusion ingredients and flavors along with their traditional sandwiches such as kimchi, bulgogi, spicy mayo and runny eggs.Now that they finally opened, I couldn't contain my excitement and went there during their opening week. I ordered the cold brew Thai tea, caramel pork banh mi and kimchi fries with a runny egg. Everything was just as good as I remembered. The banh mi was perfectly crispy and filled with delicious caramel pork and pickled vegetables. The kimchi fries was packed with tons of flavor and is definitely made for sharing since the portion is pretty big. The only thing I wouldn't order again is their cold brew Thai tea. I felt that the tea flavor was very faint and therefore the drink was not very satisfying.",0
18380,"Title: Charming French Vegan Fare on Christopher Street

I recently had the pleasure of dining at a French vegan restaurant tucked away on Christopher Street, and I must say, the experience was delightful. The place exudes a quaint and adorable atmosphere, with its immaculate interior adding to the charm. My friend and I were seated by the window, which proved to be a lovely spot.

Our waiter was the epitome of hospitality, his kindness matched only by his French accent, making the service genuinely stand out. He offered some excellent menu suggestions as we sipped on our tea and coffee.

We both decided on the vegan ""Eggs with Crab"" (a clever, plant-based concoction), reasonably priced at $17. The dish itself was a scrambled marvel, pairing pureed avocado with sautéed spinach, all brought together by a slice of crusty bread. Although slightly on the salty side, it was a satisfying, well-portioned meal that left us feeling content without being overly full.

The standout of our lunch, however, was the Orange Creme Brulee for dessert. It was exemplary, striking the perfect balance of sweetness and lightness, and could easily fool a non-vegan palate.

We celebrated our occasions with a glass of Rose wine each, a choice that was crisp, floral, and thoroughly enjoyable. Despite the restaurant being busy, filling to capacity, the service never waned.

Before we left, our accommodating waiter even took the time to take photos for us, a lovely touch to end our visit. For anyone looking for a taste of France with a vegan twist, I cannot recommend this Christopher Street gem enough.",1
18274,"At first I was skeptical. There weren't many people inside of here on a busy Saturday evening but once the gentleman next to me said try the Antica pizza I was pleasantly sold. This place is literally a hidden gem and I'm not even kidding or bolstering my review by any means. It's not a traditional pizzeria where you can order by the slice and sit down if you'd like, it's more of a pizzeria restaurant where they craft you a wonderful personal pizza to enjoy. The owner came over to us and assured that this would be great despite it not having sauce and boy it did NOT disappoint me in the slightest. My girlfriend even throughly enjoyed the gnocchi as well. Tramonti  is not overrated at all and totally earns five stars across the board for service / quality and price. Bellissimo!",0

My bf and I ordered fresh whole fish, string bean rice noodles, winter melon and duck tongue. I only had a few bites of the fish bc it totally lost the nice spicy flavor, instead it's too sweet and oily. Winter melon is good but nothing special.

17712,"Saturday noon. Was fretting on Thursday afternoon to find a place that could fit 20 of us. Surprisingly Mancora said they could on OpenTable. I even called to make sure and they didn't think I was crazy asking about that. Arrived slightly before noon just to make sure we grab a table. I would say their dining area fits 40-50 people, also with a bar table on the side. They let us in but just confirmed that the kitchen won't be ready yet, fair. I got the brunch menu and shared appetizers with people. Surprised it was only $13.95 with one drink. $14.95 for boozy brunch which is unlimited and I forgoy how much more but there was a VIP boozyGot the ceviche platter for my brunch order. The ceviche part was very Peruvian!! Reminds me of the stuff I ate in Peru! The fried chicken was a bit too dry and pieces were too small. The mussels had stuff on top which was quite similar to the ceviche but also with this corn thing I remember eating in Peru. It's stiffer and bigger than a typical corn kernel but not juicy. I also tried some of the steak and eggs from the brunch menu. The steak was thin and kind of tough to chew on. It was seasoned well and had nice beef flavor to it though. Grilled octopus was the best dish of the meal. The meat was not overcooked and was grilled with really nice smokey seasoning. They gave us four whole octopuses, head and legs, each slightly smaller than my palm. When you cut the head and legs to eat separately, it gives a good number of bites. It came with a mustardy sauce which was also used for the brunch's fried chicken. There was also a side of three pieces of this dried/fried yuca/cassava. Mussels in garlic sauce. It came on an iron skillet kind of plate but was not sizzling at all. I can't even taste garlic in the creamy sauce. Mussels were underwhelming. I like how it came with a lot of peppers and onions. There was yuca in this too but I like it dipped in the sauce. I kind of wanted to try their paella maybe next time3.75* because food itself isn't amazingly but I appreciate tasting the Peruvian flavors that I has in Peru. Also surprised how accommodating they were to my group.",0
17725,"First time @ Burger & Lobster - really disappointed in the burger (since it is one of the only two items they serve), average lobster, but fantastic service in a great locationCame here with my girlfriends and were seated promptly at our reservation time at 7:30 PM on a Thursday. If you have never been to Burger & Lobster, the only serve two things - Burgers and Lobsters with the idea of bringing the absolute best of both worlds without all the frills of complicating their menu. I ordered the Combo for 1 (6oz burger with and 1 lb whole lobster with lemon garlic butter and a side of fries and salad) and also got lobster mac and cheese for the table. Let's start with the good. The lemon garlic butter sauce was amazing. Next, the fries were really crispy but lacked salt/seasoning and the lobster was perfectly steamed and tender. I really appreciate that the claws were already cracked so it was easy for me to eat, but other than that, it was just average.  And now for the bad - the salad was limp and wet, probably from being dressed too early, but even so, I could not taste anything other than wet leaves. The burger was possibly one of the worst I have ever had. The bun was a black and white sesame bun that was so hard it was inedible. I basically had a bunless burger, but the burger itself did not have any beef flavor. It was a sad burger. The lobster mac and cheese was also another sad dish. It was not cheesy or creamy. It was a dry mac and cheese, with bits of cheese, and maybe three small bits of lobster that cost $14. Skip!The service was satisfactory. Our waiters checked in on us from time to time and refilled our waters. There was a bit of hiccup when four out of five orders came out. We waited around for 10 minutes to see if it was coming. We eventually told the waiter we were missing one entree and my friend's order eventually arrived 10 minutes later. All in all, I would skip this place. I have had better burgers and lobsters elsewhere in NYC. For a restaurant that specializes in only two items, it was a despairing miss.",0

I indulged in a Nutella and strawberry-adorned masterpiece that took my taste buds on an interstellar journey. Despite their humble size, these waffles command your full attention, ensuring you cherish each delectable morsel. Watching my waffle come to life before my eyes only added to the magic.

16896,"Title: A Delightful Evening at L'Adresse

Nestled conveniently near Bryant Park and a short stroll from Rockefeller Center, L'Adresse proved to be a gem for a late Friday dinner. Their reservation system via Yelp was efficient, securing us a table for 8:30 PM with several to spare upon arrival.

Starting with a classic Old Fashioned made with Woodford Reserve bourbon, the tone for the evening was set to impeccable. An alternative non-alcoholic choice, their lemongrass ginger tea, offered a refreshing zest. The Brussels sprouts, intermingled with Chinese sausage, presented a delectable twist on a standard appetizer, while the Caesar salad was a crisp prelude to the main course.

The star of the show was undeniably the truffle burger, generously topped with shavings of the luxurious fungus, partnered with irresistible truffle fries; truly a truffle aficionado's delight. The mushroom risotto didn't fall far behind, with its creamy texture and rich flavors, cooked to perfection.

A concise kids' menu caters to the younger diners, offering a classic burger and fries or a simple butter pasta—both dependable choices for the finicky eaters.

Though the alluring dessert menu called out to us, satiety had claimed victory. Service throughout the evening was amicable and prompt, enhancing our experience. L'Adresse delivered on all fronts, providing a thoroughly enjoyable dining experience. Highly recommended for those seeking culinary finesse in a relaxed ambiance.",1

11358,"Prepare to walk up two flights of stairs before a hefty meal as the restaurant is located on the second floor! The restaurant decor was really pretty and gave off a traditional interior vibe. Unlike most hotpot restaurants, there is only one stove so you have to share one pot with your group. If you want to try all three soup broths, I would recommend getting the Benz pot which comes with the tomato broth, mushroom broth, and their signature spicy broth. Their soup bases were good, however, I wish they had more to choose from! We ordered the different cuts of beef that they offered. The one that we enjoyed the most was the thin slices of wagyu. The vegetables were very fresh and a great way to enjoy the soup as it soaks it all in! As for service, the waiters were attentive and the dishes we ordered came out quick. They prefer speaking in mandarin than english, but they are able to communicate and help out even if your party doesn't have anyone who can speak it. For anyone trying to try this place out, I would recommend coming earlier as it does start getting busy around 6-7pm.",0

I opted for variety and went with individual slices: Grandma, BBQ Chicken, Hawaiian, Chicken Mushroom, and Sausage, along with a 2L Diet Coke to wash it all down.

True to its reputation, Little Italy Pizza did not disappoint. Every slice was a masterpiece, but the BBQ Chicken and Hawaiian slices stood out with their flavorful toppings and divine sauce. The crispy crust was exactly what you'd hope for in a New York-style slice.

At $23 total for an ample meal, the value was undeniable. Even when my order ran a tad late, a simple call connected me with a considerate staff member who handled my inquiry with the utmost friendliness.

I popped into this bustling restaurant during peak lunch hours without a reservation and, to my delight, found myself cozily seated at the bar in just 20 minutes. The service was remarkable; attentive without being intrusive, ensuring every patron at the bar felt taken care of.

The food was a joyous journey for the taste buds. The crispy spring rolls were a revelation – far from the typical bland vegetable fare, these were a true ""flavor bomb,"" seasoned impeccably with a wrapper fried to a perfect crisp while avoiding any unpleasant greasiness. 

The boldly mushroom-centric soup caught me off guard in the best way possible, delivering a hearty and flavorful experience. The Pad See Ew confirmed what all good versions of the dish should be—thoroughly coated in sauce, with each component cooked flawlessly. Although I must note, the presentation lacked the finesse of my neighbor's plate, it did little to detract from the overall excellence of the meal.

I recently visited Angela's and had an eating experience that was profoundly moving. Since my total gastrectomy, my appreciation for food has heightened, and Angela's turkey sub was a testament to this newfound joy. Each bite was an emotional journey—tears were shed over the exquisite combination of textures and flavors.

The bread struck the perfect balance between freshness and crunch, serving as a worthy vessel for the succulent turkey. The chipotle sauce was a revelation, adding a divine touch that complemented the high-quality cheese flawlessly. Even post-op, with a limited capacity for food, every mouthful was a treasure, with the bonus of delicious leftovers to prolong the experience.

Although it's been six months since my operation, the flavors from Angela's have left a lasting impression.

182,"Title: A Hidden Gem in the East Village Specializing in Xinjiang Noodles

My latest dining adventure took me off the beaten path in the East Village, where I stumbled upon a delightful new noodle house. Its understated façade with a small sign might be easy to overlook, but the exterior menu display enticingly showcases their offerings.

The focus here is on the cuisine from Xinjiang, and the compact menu highlights their mastery in noodles. I savored the sautéed rice noodles, while my companion enjoyed the stirred noodles, both dishes offering a journey of flavors. We opted for some extra zing, and the waiter presented us with the chef's special homemade hot sauce – a fiery delight without overshadowing the meal's inherent tastes.

It's worth noting these noodles are a textural pleasure, smooth and jiggly, a refreshing deviation from the common flat noodles. The only suggestion I'd make is an expansion of the drink menu, incorporating options like beer or tea could enhance the dining experience.

Service was commendable – kind, helpful, and responsive even over the phone. I'm already planning my next visit to explore more of their menu. This spot is a must-try for noodle enthusiasts and those looking to taste the unique flavors of Xinjiang.",1

Quite a few customers but usually not packed and there's usually always still empty spots for you to sit and eat inside. Clean and a restroom on the left side. A few different options and I prefer my poke bowl without sauce as the seafood are all mixed with sauce already. My friend loves the sauce though. The ingredients used to be just okay and sometimes not so great but this time around it's fresh and I really enjoyed it. Would recommend",0

If you haven't been to this gem of an Italian eatery, you're seriously missing out. The risotto is simply divine—imagine a creamy bowl of al dente rice smothered in a savory pink sauce, intermingled with tender chicken, crisp green peppers, juicy tomatoes, and generously topped with a mountain of Parmesan cheese. It's a flavor explosion that I can only describe as mouthgasmic!

Don't be fooled, I don't usually gravitate towards Italian cuisine, but this place has converted me with its risotto alone. The magic doesn't end with the taste; the chefs prepare your meal right before your eyes, promising freshness and a sprinkle of culinary theater.

It's no wonder the place is buzzing with patrons, which is a double-edged sword: the ambiance is lively and inviting, yet snagging a seat can be a challenge, not to mention the wait due to its popularity. Despite this minor hiccup, trust me, the food is well worth the patience. For anyone looking to satisfy their Italian cravings, this hotspot is a must-visit. Just be prepared for a short wait—it's an undeniable testament to the deliciousness that awaits.",1
11445,"Title: Promising Experience with a Slight Hiccup

I recently dined at a very good restaurant that seems to have embraced a chain vibe. The service was nothing short of professional, the dining room exuded elegance, and the food was quite a treat. Each dish featured well-balanced flavor profiles accompanied by fresh, great-tasting sides, like the guacamole, that were a delight to the taste buds. The drinks menu was equally impressive, offering inventive options to enjoy.

Our dining experience was efficient; we enjoyed our guacamole and entrees and were out within the hour. However, there was a notable downside to our visit. A strong odor reminiscent of paint or varnish permeated the dining area, causing some discomfort and light-headedness. The staff attributed it to external factors beyond their control.

While the skirt steak fell short in portion satisfaction, especially for its $30 price tag, the accompanying enchilada was the highlight of the dish. Despite the fumes, which I trust was a one-off incident, I look forward to returning. It's my intention to update this review after my next visit, hopefully sans any unpleasant odors.",1
20997,"I was very excited to dine at Marseille and finally had the chance to on Sunday. My friend and I decided to try out their brunch menu since it was highly recommended by a bunch of my blogger friends. The restaurant itself was stunning and very detailed to say the least. The staff was kind, well mannered, courteous, and just flat out amazing. Our waitress, Christina, was amazing as well and she even suggested a few menu items that I happily enjoyed. They have an amazing bottomless mimosas for $19 and trust me it's worth every penny. The drinks we had were a pomegranate mimosa and a regular mimosa. Both drinks were nicely garnished and a little strong just how I like it. For an appetizer, I had the french onion soup which I would highly recommend! The broth was flavorful, had a good amount of cooked onions inside, and lots of cheese. We ordered three entrees and they were all delicious! The entrees were steak with eggs and fries; short rib on a bed of polenta and fried onions; and their infamous french toast. The steak was cooked perfectly, eggs were delicious and far from dry; and the fries were nicely crisped. The short rib had a sweet wine sauce on it which I enjoyed and the polenta was tasty too. The french toast was probably the best I've ever had! They definitely used a high quality toast and can definitely tell a difference. The french toast was in a sweet banana foster like sauce that I absolutely loved!  They placed fresh berries and pecans that were juicy. I loved every meal and you will too.",0
19558,"My small group of three opted for bar seating at this charming restaurant, and we were delighted by the dessert menu's vast and intriguing selection. The matcha lava cake, a standout treat, was an utter delight with its rich flavor and satisfyingly sweet, not bitter, profile. My friends echoed my sentiment with high praise for their respective desserts. However, a word of caution: the desserts were served in skillets without holders, posing a risk for an inadvertent burn. A less pleasing note was the Thai iced tea, which skewed overly sweet, straying from the traditional taste one might expect. Despite these minor critiques, this restaurant makes a fantastic date spot and is well worth a visit for dessert enthusiasts.",1
17357,"I found this place on Yelp based on my zip code and after reading the reviews decided to give it a try.  We were a party of 5 and probably ordered 1/2 of what the menu has to offer. The server was very nice, attentive and seems to be nearby every time we needed help. The owner came up to our table and made us feel very welcomed. We had the octopus, so goodThe hummus, babaganoush and Moroccan salad, awesome.  The falafel, mehThe fennel salad, okThe beets salad very goodThe roasted cauliflower very good The happy hour drinks were a bargain. And the noise level was perfect even though the place was packed. I would definitely come back.",0
21015,"Title: Satisfaction Achieved with Mindful Ordering at [Restaurant Name]

I recently visited [Restaurant Name] for their all-you-can-eat lunch special at $16.95 and left thoroughly impressed. Our party of four eagerly ordered an ambitious array of rolls and dishes, but our attentive waiter wisely suggested we scale back, noting concern for potential waste. The owner's presence, ensuring guests finished their meals, underscored their commitment to preventing excess.

Adhering to their advice, we were spared from overindulgence without sacrificing any satisfaction; every item was delicious and left us contentedly full. I commend [Restaurant Name] for their excellent food and for encouraging responsible consumption. It's a place I'd recommend, with a reminder to patrons to order as much as they can enjoy to help the business thrive.",1
16145,"Visited Gentleman Farmer on Saturday night. The food and drinks we had were excellent, but the forced dinner routine instead of the expected wine bar approach made it an uncomfortable experience.Quality: Gentleman Farmer views itself as more of a dinner spot than a traditional wine bar. They want complete orders up front and seemed genuinely confused that we were just there for a few glasses of wine. And that attitude was disappointing because everything we had was delicious, and the menu looked to have other tasty dishes as well. The wine selection was big, but I feel like a few more by the glass options would be helpful. For food we had the Bison Tartare, which was a nice alternative to the standard steak or beef tartare. Tougher and more gamey, it still worked extremely well with the accoutrements.Quantity: Fair pours and the Bison Tartare was a good sized starter.Value: $11-$13 for a Glass of Wine. $18 for the Bison Tartar.Ambiance: Gentleman Farmer is located in Lower Manhattan. The narrow wine bar has about a dozen tables snuggly fitted into the space. The bar has a simple, yet very stylish look with a wood panel ceiling, lanterns on the wall, and a few copper pots hanging for decor. The music was alternative pop mixed with some jazz. It was a place I could have envisioned hanging out a while, but that was not the atmosphere created.Crowd: There were about four empty tables when we entered, so it felt weird that the host asked if we had a reservation and then made a fuss about squeezing us in. At no point during our visit did the tables fill up, two always sat empty and the other was filled by another walk-in.Service: Our waiter did not seem to understand we just wanted to enjoy wine and a few bites rather than a complete meal. There was also a constant hurried mood, as if they needed us out to seat another party.Parking: A few street spots in the area.",0
13245,"This was my most favorite meal in my 4 day visit to New York! We came on a Friday for an early dinner before our Harry Potter and the Cursed Child show at Lyric Theatre. Word of warning - you aren't able to make a same day reservation, but since we arrived at 545, we were able to be seated pretty quickly. We sat upstairs and had a few different servers that helped our table. The service was very efficient. We decided to go the tapas route and ordered the chili shrimp, crunchy tofu, roasted vegetables, rice cake w/cheese, and steamed veggie dumplings. Everything was excellent! I highly recommend the truffle rice cake with cheese!! It is basically a Korean twist on mac & cheese and was just delicious! Also, the roasted vegetables were sooo good with almost a granola like topping. I would also recommend that if you are to get any of the dumplings to go ahead and just get them fried. The steamed dumplings just weren't that exciting and fall apart so easily. We finished off our meal with the lava cake. Now, I am a fan of a hotter and more meltier chocolate center when it comes to a lava cake. I expect it to ooze out warm chocolate when I cut into it. This one was more like a warm ganache type center that stayed put. Don't get me wrong, though, it was still really good and the gelato used on top was amazing!I would say this is a must check out restaurant in the area, just definitely have a reservation!",0
16659,"About $5 for a pepperoni sicilian slice, which is kind of pricey, but the pizza here is pretty darn tasty.There are no seats so you just stand either inside or out front to eat your pizza. I came on a weekend morning at 10am so there wasn't any line, but I could only imagine the wait during prime meal hours (or drunken nights). Save yourself the hassle and pay with cash - I found out later on that what the cashier told me he was going to charge me wasn't actually so; there was an additional CC usage markup that was not disclosed. It was only a few pennies but as a consumer I'd like to know that you're charging me 4% in order to use my Credit Card.",0
18798,"Returning to this gem after a few years, I was delighted to find that it not only holds up to my fond memories but possibly exceeds them. The pizza here gives the esteemed Joe's a run for its money, perhaps even besting it. A must-visit for any pizza aficionado.",1
15,So i love coming to this place on weekends the atmosphere is great and the food is usually amazing! Unfortunately the nachos not so much. I am currently here wanting a mini meal and i order the nachos it was very disappointing. I've had the kale salad and the short rib tacos and usually rave about this place this meal today makes me think i should stick to the meals i know.,0
13904,"Having eaten at Gabriel Kreuther several times I must say that it keeps getting better and better. Gabriel Kreuther never fails to impress. The cocktails are delicious. The wine selection is amazing. The food is unique and delicious. This was our first time in the lounge and it was a great dining experience as well. The more elegant dining room is a more traditional French menu, but always very creative. Gabriel Kreuther has certainly become one of New York's best fine dining restaurants.",0
