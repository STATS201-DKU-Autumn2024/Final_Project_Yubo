10379,"Title: A Comforting Bite in the Bustling Chelsea Market

If you find yourself navigating the bustling corridors of Chelsea Market craving some quintessential American fare, Creamline is a beacon of classic comfort food. Unlike many of the other food stands in the area, this gem offers a welcome oasis with a few tables and booths for a seated meal—even during the notorious lunch rush.

My recent visit saw me sinking my teeth into the succulent crispy chicken sandwich, with honey sauce and pickles adding a delightful yet slightly messy tang. Be prepared with a stack of napkins; this is finger-licking goodness at its messiest. Alongside, I indulged in sweet potato waffle fries with a side of chipotle mayo, transforming an ordinary side dish into an extraordinary taste adventure. Note that fries don't accompany sandwiches and come at an additional cost. 

Admittedly, the prices might seem a tad steep for some, but the quality and flavor of the food justify the expense. Creamline is definitely a stop worthy of your taste buds and time when at Chelsea Market.",1
1092,"Title: A Fusion of Traditional and Trendy: Little Alley Shines in Midtown

If you're torn between modern and traditional Chinese cuisine, Little Alley in Midtown gracefully marries the two. On a quiet Tuesday evening, my friends and I easily secured a table at this stylish eatery, which boasts an inviting ambience with its bright decor and an eye-catching wooden telephone booth.

Taking advantage of the happy hour until 7pm on weekdays, we sipped on perfectly mixed French 75s and Lychee Martinis for just $9, a steal compared to their regular price. The food, a delightful array of authentic Shanghainese flavors, was the main event. Standouts included the succulent Crab Soup Dumplings and the richly flavored Pan Fried Pork Buns. The Typhoon Shelter Garlic Shrimp and Shanghai Stir-Fried Thick Noodle did not disappoint, and the Braised Pork with Preserved Vegetable was a hit, offering a homey taste of Shanghai.

While the Chinese Sausage Fried Rice fell short on zest, the experimental Emperor Soup Dumpling was a necessary tick on our culinary checklist, despite its deviation from the meaty norm. The one miss of the night was the jellyfish—unfortunately dry and lacking in taste.

Our check-in on Yelp sweetened the conclusion of our meal with a complimentary Sticky Rice Stuffed Lotus Root dessert that split opinions down the middle. Though some of us relished the warm, sweet sauce, others were left wanting.

Beware of the small portion sizes—the modest prices can be deceptive—but with strategic ordering, you'll leave satisfied. For a group of four, dinner and drinks reached a total of $245, inclusive of tax and tip. Little Alley, with its unique blend of authenticity and modernity, truly stands out in the bustling heart of Midtown.",1
1291,"Okay, so I didn't expect much in terms of Korean food in this neighborhood, but the food here was rock solid! Man, everything was pretty tasty and very well-seasoned (which I admit I'm on the lighter side at home). The quality of the meat they use is good, which maybe not everyone would appreciate or understand for the type of dish they order, and the portions were very generous. The bulgogi fried rice was great and their dumpling soup was savory in all the right ways. Their fried rice dishes come with a complimentary broth that's light enough to use as a palate cleanser if you had any appetizers. The entrées come with a free side of cabbage-style kimchi and pickled radiah. Although you order at the counter like a QSR, they made everything fresh and brought the food in real dishes and utensils, which I admit initially confused me, but I felt was tip worthy anyway. The staff member that took my order was friendly and let us use the bathroom (there's two behind the counter).Looks like they have a few other locations as well, although no clue if it's the same owner or what. Still, I'd definitely come back if I were to crave a quick, but otherwise some very legit Korean food outside of Ktown or the eastern Queens area.",0
13927,"I recently visited the new Veggie Grill in NYC and it was an absolute delight! The Nashville hot 'chicken' blew me away with its spot-on flavors and textures – it's a must-try. The vegan buffalo 'wings' were the highlight for me; truly the best I've ever had, hands down. The Mac and cheese also did not disappoint, rounding out a meal that has me eager to return. Anyone on the fence about Veggie Grill needs to take the plunge. Get ready to be wowed by a vegan menu that hits all the right notes. I'm already planning my next visit to conquer the rest of the menu. This place is a solid 10/10.",1
1632,"Title: Margarita Mishap

My girlfriend and I recently visited this highly-recommended spot for their supposedly stellar margaritas, only to be met with a wave of disappointments. We were eager to enjoy a tropical margarita on the rocks and a frozen ultimate margarita, but our order was muddled, resulting in two on-the-rocks versions, one sadly not even the flavor we requested. To our dismay, the tequila was not the Don Julio we asked for but a less than satisfying house option. The taste was so off-putting that I lacked the enthusiasm to request a correction.

Adding to our frustration was the service. Our waitress lacked promptness and warmth, dimming the ambiance of our evening. It was only toward the end that the owner showed some hospitality by offering complimentary Don Julio shots, a gesture overshadowed by the preceding experience.

Though appreciated, the late attempt at amends was not enough to redeem our visit. I regret to say that despite the owner's kindness, we won't be returning.",1
17416,"Title: A Gem in the Vegan Crown: Beyond Sushi

Having ventured to Beyond Sushi no less than five times, despite the trek from upstate New York, this speaks volumes about the enthralling culinary experience offered by this establishment. Ranking effortlessly in my top five vegan spots across New York, Beyond Sushi sets itself apart with its originality and commitment to healthful, plant-based creations.

Abandoning the usual trope of greasy fare or mimicked meat dishes that many vegan eateries fall prey to, Beyond Sushi is a breath of fresh air. Their menu boasts an array of exceptional flavor pairings that are as nutritious as they are tantalizing to the taste buds. Each visit has presented me with a new seasonal offering, underscoring their commitment to variety and innovation.

Personal favorites such as the spicy mang roll, the comforting chili mushroom soup, and the delightful fun-guy dumplings never disappoint. And while there are seasonal rolls that fleetingly steal my heart, wishing for their permanence on the menu is a testament to their deliciousness.

Beyond Sushi has also passed the taste test of my friends and family, satisfying vegans and omnivores alike. It's with unwavering confidence that I recommend Beyond Sushi to anyone in search of a culinary experience that celebrates the versatility and richness of plant-based cuisine.",1
14654,"Joe's Pizza offers the finest slice in Times Square, truly living up to its celebrated reputation. With a crust that strikes an ideal balance between chewy and crunchy, it's tailor-made for the classic New York fold. The sauce is another highlight, bursting with flavor that keeps you craving more. Despite typically long lines, they're swift-moving and undoubtedly merit the patience. Adding to the ambiance is a wall adorned with photos of celebrities enjoying Joe's fare, underscoring its iconic status. A must-visit for any pizza aficionado.",1
3026,"Title: A Sicilian Slice to Remember

I had the pleasure of indulging in a slice of Sicilian pizza, sans pepperoni, and it was nothing short of sublime. The staff made sure to heat it up to perfection, enhancing every bite. It's best enjoyed immediately, as I noticed a slight decline in temperature during a 7-minute walk back to my hotel, yet the quality was uncompromised. The dough struck an exquisite balance between crunch and softness, making the brief wait totally worth it. Highly recommend a visit for an authentic and satisfying pizza experience!",1
1353,"I recently dined at this gem of a restaurant and was thoroughly impressed with the fast, attentive service. The butter chicken paired with naan, priced at $23, was a delightful treat – creamy, flavorful, and perfectly cooked. Additionally, the lunch specials offer a great value, allowing patrons to sample a variety of dishes without breaking the bank. Don't miss out on exploring the side menu options for some added culinary adventure. Highly recommended for a satisfying meal.",1
13373,"If you like pad Thai, I highly recommend this place! This was my second time eating here and I very much enjoyed it. It has a nice ambiance as well; the music choice is 90s R&B but it makes for an interesting experience. The place is a bit small so I would recommend making a reservation but overall, it was a good, reasonably priced meal!",0
20409,"Tucked away off the beaten path, this eatery offers a unique vibe that instantly makes for a refreshing pit stop. The unconventional square-shaped pizzas present a fun twist, although the conventional triangular slices still win the day here. While the pesto and regular toppings fell short of extraordinary, they were satisfactory without making a lasting impression. What really shines at this place is the crust — thin, perfectly crispy, and undeniably the star of the show. Don't miss out on appreciating the texture and flavor of each bite, all while soaking in the nostalgia of their famed wall of fame. Mera's tip is spot on: savor that crust to the fullest!",1
19701,"The hostess was gracious and the place was empty when we walked in at 12:30PM on a Saturday. The restaurant is very accessible to Subway. We ordered empanadas, nachos and tacos. The slightly bougie tacos are pricier $4 each but so worth it. Everything else on the menu is cheap. The tortillas are freshly made, the sauces too and everything tasted great. Love this little place, and its hostess. My friends' checks came to $10 or less. Highly recommend!",0
15296,"Square pepperoni pizza?!? Sayyyy what?!? Staying in midtown I always make the journey here because their pizza is that amazing.The Sicilian style, is a square pizza with homemade buffalo and sweet marinara sauce on top. Their known for their pepperoni Sicilian style pizza - which comes with their not sweet marinara. Tip, don't come after 1030pm hoping for a pep slice. Their pepperoni pizza usually sells out before closing, don't pull what i did and come at 1045 hoping they would have pepperoni slices left. I love love pizza and this is on my top 5 in the world (with pizza from Rome being my #1) The pizza servers are nice here too, super friendly!",0
18991,"I have dreams about this gnocchi. Wish I lived closer but I would probably go way too much. My boyfriend and I have an obsession with gnocchi so when I saw this place, it was a no brainer to visit. I made a reservation for 6:30 on a friday night. We arrived early and they were able to seat us right away without problem. I had looked at the menu already online and was pretty set on an order. Then the specials menu came and we ended up going with that. We bleach got a plate of traditional handmade gnocchi, his with vodka sauce, mine with black truffle cream sauce. The black truffle cream sauce gnocchi was honestly one of the greatest plates of food ice had in a very long time. The gnocchi melted in my mouth and the cream sauce was light and delicious with big shaving of truffle. Even now writing this I just want more. To go with the gnocchi we had some glasses of wine, nothing too exciting but that wasn't really the point of the visit. It did pair with the gnocchi well. Atmosphere was very cozy and comfortable, the place is small so I would recommend a reservation. Service was super fast and very good. Would love to go back again!",0
18295,"I would give 3.5 if that's an option.  The food was good but it's quite pricey. We sat at the ""chefs table"" which is a huge and odd table and looking into the kitchen. And you don't get to interact with the chef cuz it's not a counter. We find it a bid odd and honestly the dishes are hard to reach. Do not get the macha beer. It is essentially beer added with macha powder and it doesn't really make the beer taste better. They charge you extra $5 for the macha powder. The cod was very good! Cooked perfect and flavorful.The sashimi was really fresh. And you get to grate your own wasabi. Don't get the fried chicken wings. They are meatless. Maybe they took the meat for the chicken meatball? Beef tartare - mainly are pickles though. Chicken liver with rice pancake - my favorite dish of the night but my friends didn't like chicken liver so more for me (yay)The tofu pot is ridiculously overpriced and it tasted ok.Duck was good. The huge chicken meatball was good and I didn't want to share. I want my own ball!I definitely think that you can find better food at a more affordable price.",0
18450,"Title: A Brunch to Remember at Thursday Kitchen

Review:

I've long been a dinner-time devotee of Thursday Kitchen, but their Sunday brunch has sealed my adoration. Available from 12-3 PM, it's a culinary escapade that's not to be missed. The kale salad was a refreshing departure from the mundane, with a sweet and tangy sauce that awakened my palate. The crab ravioli, adorned with a savory sauce, was a revelation in every bite. Service matched the high bar set by the food, with our waitress exuding warmth and attentiveness, ensuring our complete satisfaction. Thursday Kitchen has outdone itself, earning a rare 6/5 rating for an overall exceptional experience. Highly recommended!",1
15675,"Title: Delightful Dining Experience with a Side of Planning

My group of five ventured into this bustling eatery on a Saturday night without a reservation and encountered a reasonably expected hour-long wait. This minor inconvenience was alleviated by the restaurant's efficient texting system, allowing us to explore the vast mall in which it's situated while we awaited our table. 

The online reservation system is a godsend for better-prepared diners, and we'll be sure to utilize it next time to bypass the wait. Once seated, the culinary adventure began with their unique offerings, leaving a memorable impression on our taste buds. The Spicy Noodles packed a punch, and the Mochi drink was a delightful surprise, capturing the essence of mochi in a refreshingly light alcoholic beverage.

Service was a standout, with attentive staff ensuring our water glasses remained full, making the experience smooth for our sizable group. The only hiccup came in the form of a few menu items being unavailable, a minor setback likely due to the late hour and weekend rush.

In summary, the restaurant offers a pleasing atmosphere suitable for groups, with distinctive flavors and commendable service that will see us returning. A tip for future diners: make a reservation to fully enjoy what this culinary gem has to offer!",1
20025,"Pretty disappointed after watching a documentary and news about this place delivering fresh tuna from japan and preparing it every morning for their customers.The fish freshness and quality of sushi and taste were overpriced. I felt I paid more for the location, Ambiente and things they have invested around this restaurant for its fame than the actual taste and quality of the sushi.",0
10752,"I recently celebrated a culinary triumph at a local sushi spot during their one-year anniversary, where an irresistible 50% off omakase deal awaited. Though unable to secure a counter seat, the experience did not disappoint. The waitstaff was commendably quick and attentive, enhancing the dining affair.

Among an array of delights, the wagyu with uni and the spotted prawn with uni were standout stars, accompanied by sublime scallop and otoro that danced on the palate. The omakase experience peaked with an indulgent uni don, lavishly crowned with caviar and gilded with gold flakes—a sight to savor.

While indulging in a selection of sakes, the Dassai 50 emerged as a lone favorite, complementing the high notes of the meal.

At the standard $85, I may be hesitant to return, but the anniversary promotion delivered an experience of exceptional value, worthy of recommendation.",1
20566,What a great place to go. Oysters for $1.50 each during happy hour. WHAT!!!!!!!! Yep. Happy hour till 6 pm. Clam chowder was great. On point. Fresh bread. Also if you get the widow seat you can people watch. Met some people here so a great place to meet up.,0

16331,"Nestled in a bustling district, this Indonesian gem offers a delightful fast-casual dining experience that caters to both carnivores and herbivores alike. My companion, a devout meat-lover, and I, with my penchant for vegetarian options and a childhood nostalgia for rijsttafels, found common ground in this vibrant eatery.

I opted for the mushroom rendang, a flavorful dish that paid homage to tradition while suiting my vegetarian preferences. While it didn't disappoint in taste, my adventurous palate is already plotting to explore other menu items on a future visit.

The undeniable star of the meal, however, was the lapis legit, or spekkoek, a layered spice cake that was simply divine. Light, aromatic, and served in just the right portion, it provided a sweetly satisfying conclusion to our Indonesian culinary journey. This restaurant promises and delivers a taste of Indonesia worth revisiting.",1
2999,"Title: Mixed Feelings on a Celebratory Evening

I ventured into the much acclaimed restaurant with high expectations, particularly because of its proud $$$ symbol and the buzz from a recent write-up in the Times. Our visit was to celebrate my grandmother's remarkable 90th birthday with a large family gathering.

Service was a notable highlight and the main reason I've settled on a 3-star rating. The hostess offered a warm welcome and efficiently seated us, supplying menus and a wine list promptly. It was a nice touch to have water served straight away. The waiter was attentive, adeptly managing silverware changes and clearing plates, enhancing the dining experience.

The meal itself, however, was a collection of highs and lows. My peekytoe crab appetizer was crisp and refreshing but disappointingly slight in portion. The consensus at the table was positive towards the French onion soup, though my aunt's escargot left her wanting more of a garlic punch.

Entrées provoked differing opinions. I found my salmon satisfactory, but it missed that sought-after crispy skin. Those who ordered the special Peking-style duck were underwhelmed, feeling it didn't justify its lavish price with its overdone preparation. Others who selected the regular menu's duck were more content, noting its moisture and flavor. The branzino received a thumbs up from my sister's boyfriend.

Desserts were a mixed bag, with the floating island standing out as the star, whereas the cookie plate, souffle, and sorbet were merely passable.

A significant drawback of the restaurant was the poor acoustics, which made conversation a challenge. It was much too loud when full, and only marginally improved when diners thinned out.

In summary, while the service was commendable, the food was inconsistent and the noise levels detracted from the ambiance. Despite the restaurant's prestige and promise, we will be exploring other venues for our future celebrations.",1
13982,"Finally came to try this place; was pretty excited since there's a dearth of korean places in this area. We got:- bottled hite (bc the tap ones were lager) $6- japchae with rice 9/10: honestly surprisingly good, esp because i think its really easy to mess this up. But the noodle texture was on point and so was flavor. They were missing the pyogo mushroom which i think is key, but understandable bc those are a little expensive- medium drumsticks and wings combo 9/10: we got half soy garlic and half sweet&spicy. The soy garlic was pretty good, i definitely preferred it to sweet & spicy. The latter was more sweet than spicy, and definitely more sweet than i like, and it tasted mildly of ketchup? (Dont get me wrong i love ketchup but when im having kfc im looking for that slightly spicy taste). In terms of the fried-ness, its more bonchon/boka than it is pelicana. Aka, more of a slightly crispy skin than chunks of fried dough coated onto chicken - less ""in your face sauce-y"" and more ""infused sauce-y""- korean radish 9/10: was honestly a little turned off when i found out they charge for radish ($2.75) bc thats like having a korean place charge you for side dishes. This should be a given, especially for a kchicken place. However, they redeemed themselves bc it wasnt your stereotypical white radish, but pickled with something else so it got a nice purplish pink color. But, i still dont think you should be charging for radish. I'd rather have free white radish than $2.75 pink radish Bonus points for:- the pour yourself beer / local draft beer- hite on draft (altho its the lager version)- poppin playlist of mid-to-late 2000s female pop music (think kelly clarkson, early taytay)- venturing into the non-koreanified/asianified neighborhoodIf this was a place in ktown, it would probably be closer to three stars though..",0
17720,"I recently visited an excellent brunch spot in the Meatpacking District that truly lived up to the hype. At either $45 or $55, you're treated to a satisfying entrée and an unlimited flow of mimosas, white sangria, and Bellini drinks, all of which were simply amazing. The menu offers a diverse range of options, ensuring there’s something for everyone. I opted for the a la vodka penne pasta with grilled chicken, and it did not disappoint. It was not only delicious but also incredibly fulfilling. This place is a must-visit for brunch enthusiasts looking for quality food and drinks in a vibrant atmosphere.",1

The café offers a welcoming space for coffee lovers and foodies alike, serving up a variety of pastries, cakes, and sandwiches. The interior is notably clean and fresh, reflective of its newness. Prices are quite fair for the area, adding to the appeal. The staff was amiable, contributing to a warm atmosphere. With ample seating, including bench-style options along the wall, it’s perfect for both individual visitors and groups who wish to combine tables. Definitely a spot worth checking out for a casual bite or coffee break.",1
19676,"Title: A Delightful Find at King Dumplings

I finally made it to King Dumplings after having heard about Prosperity Dumpling, and it was absolutely worth it. Their pork and chive dumplings are a steal at $1.50, but I went for the veggie dumplings - 10 for $5. Given the dreary weather, I opted for the veggie dumpling noodle soup for an extra fifty cents. It was divine!

The consistency of both the dumplings and noodles hit the mark, and the freshness of the vegetable filling shone through. It's refreshing to find such budget-friendly, hearty lunch options. The eatery itself was more spacious than anticipated, with a charming ambiance underscored by a quirky graffiti wall. King Dumplings is unquestionably a no-frills gem with character to spare.",1
20003,"After a tireless quest sampling the crème de la crème of NYC's highly-rated burgers, I've found a gem that rightfully claims a spot in my top three. The folded burger at this spot is a game-changer. Yes, it's $14 and doesn't come with a side, but every dollar is justified. The unique blend of meats, coupled with perfectly griddled cheese, strikes the ideal balance of flavor and texture. Nestled within a pita, the meat-to-bread ratio is on point, and the aioli? It's the masterstroke that brings this culinary masterpiece together. Don't let this place slip under your radar — it's not to be missed.",1
12592,"I'm shocked by the low reviews for this place because I was very impressed by the ramen I've had here. I ordered the Tokyo Shoyu ramen and added an egg and mushrooms. It was extremely yummy. Also had the plum tea which was great as well. I love that it's in a food hall as well. Food Halls are one of my favorite spots to check out when I'm traveling because I get to try multiple foods! Like I said earlier, shocked by the bad reviews but it makes me more excited to try other places if THIS is considered low quality.",0
2861,"I had no expectations coming to this place. I wanted to try so many things from the menu, so I will be returning as it is just downstairs from where I work. I was so full from what I had ordered. I ordered the whole wheat ramen, chicken dumplings, (my friend ordered) veggie ramen, and shishito peppers. I didnt particularly like the ramen too much. I can make better ramen on my own. The seared shishito peppers had dashi soy and yuzu salt on it. I wish it had some more seasoning on it or spice. The ramen had tumeric egg, tofu, and lily mushrooms. The chicken dumplings were okay, it kept falling apart though. It was a little bit salty. The veggie ramen wasn't ordered by me so I didnt get a chance to taste it.",0
16760,"Great place for dim sum but some things you will need to know-during peak hours there will be a big line and crowd outside; go inside and get a ticket as soon as you get there.

11506,"I stopped in here for a couple of sandwiches for myself and my son while we waited for hubby to get out of work. I got my boy a Lenwich w/muenster cheese and I ordered myself a Fish'wich with red onions and no tomatoes. Both sandwiches tasted really good and the sizes are decent. I also ordered a large mac & cheese which was NOT tasty. It was bland and the texture was off.I've never been here before but the set up is nice and I like the fact that you can customize your sandos and salads. Everything looked very fresh and the place is immaculately clean. They also offer soups and plenty of beverages.At first, the staff didn't seem too friendly but at the end of my transaction, the overall feeling was a little more amicable.All in all, this is a great place for a sando or salad but stay away from that Mac.",0
12865,"Title: A Delightful Dive into Ocean Delicacies

My pal and I, on a spontaneous oyster craving, stumbled upon this bustling gem with an astonishingly brief ten-minute wait. Our taste buds embarked on a culinary voyage with a dozen succulent East and West Point oysters that truly lived up to the hype.

Eager for more, we dived into the oyster shooters, an exhilarating prelude to the star of the show – the Catalina shrimp. This dish was the very definition of 'bomb,' served with a sauce that was nothing short of a revelation when paired with the bread. Flavor profiles melded in a harmonious dance that left us craving more.

The fingerling potatoes were the perfect supporting act – tasty and well-executed. There's intrigue too; a backside bar whispers of secrets to be discovered on future visits.

The ambiance, cool with a gentle dim lit embrace, invites intimacy and casual dining. This place has etched a spot on my go-to list, and I'm already plotting a return to indulge in the rest of their tantalizing menu.",1
10717,"Title: Hidden Gem Offering Unbeatable Value and Warm Service

I recently discovered an absolute steal of a deal at a charming eatery that's been open for just 7 months. For a mere $10, I indulged in a duo of savory cheeseburger rolls, a generous serving of chips (or fries), and a refreshing can of soda. Talk about value!

But what truly sets this place apart isn't just the prices—it's the heartwarming customer service. The staff's kindness was on full display when they graciously welcomed me to stay and savor my meal, even after closing time.

The surprises didn't end there: their mochi ice cream, as I learned from the friendly staff, is sourced from the same suppliers as upscale sushi joints like Buddakan. If you're a mochi aficionado, this spot is a must-visit.

In addition to the indulgent rolls and sweet treats, the restaurant boasts an array of sushi, sashimi, innovative hand-rolls, and other Japanese delights. This hidden gem truly has something special. Don't miss out – give it a try!",1
15748,"Their menu is divided into salads, small plates, pizzas, and specials (think entrees).  If I were to list out the patrons' favorites, it would require a complete reading of the entire menu, which is never a bad problem for a restaurant to have.  I'm a mushroom lover, so I opted for Arancini, which is a rice ball that is breaded with a panko mix and served with an aioli.  The other item on the small plate section that interests me was the fried calamari that is made with a beer batter.  This batter held the perfect amount of seasonings and created a lighter taste compared to the traditional way calamari is made.  For our pizza, we picked one red and one white pizza.  The Tea's pizza is named after its first employee.  This white pizza includes house-made burrata, Gorgonzola, truffle oil, cherry tomatoes, prosciutto, and arugula.  It is literally all of my favorite things on a pizza. Their pizzas are the perfect sharing size between two people, but I found myself wanting to eat more than my fair share of Tea's pizza.  I asked what is the unsung hero of the menu is, and the server immediately responded with ""San Gennaro"" which includes sweet Italian sausage, caramelized onions, roasted peppers, ricotta cheese, San Marzano, and tomato sauce.  Brunetti's pizza crust has a nice crisp on the outside and a chewy inside, which is my favorite combination.Brunetti's pizza is perfect for a casual dinner or date night.  Their extensive wine and beer selection will keep everyone in the party happy.  This is also a family-friendly restaurant that includes a children's menu.  In the back of Brunetti's is a private outdoor garden, which is a great way to escape the hustle and bustle of the city.",0

11251,"Title: Hidden Omakase Gem in East Village

My dining experience at Pado, the new sushi spot in East Village, was truly a surprise package. Despite the lackluster ambience that might remind you of a strip mall sushi joint, the omakase here is a revelation.

On a whim, we snagged a last-minute reservation for a Friday evening and found the place comfortably buzzing at 6 PM. They welcomed us with complimentary sweet potato chips, setting the stage for the main act.

The omakase tasting surprised us with its modern twists—especially notable was the foie gras nigiri. The chefs at Pado are clearly not afraid to push the boundaries while maintaining the essence of traditional sushi.

While the setting is unassuming, Pado is definitely a spot to keep on your radar for a low-key evening that delivers high-quality sushi. If you're in for an adventure on the palate without the usual sushi spot fuss, Pado is worth the visit. I'm already looking forward to my next meal here.",1
11286,"I'm a regular customer for delivery from this spot and while I've never set foot in the restaurant itself, I can attest to the quality of their food. It stands out in the area, delivering consistently good flavor. My go-to dishes are the grilled pork with rice or vermicelli, which always hit the spot. I've yet to sample their pho, but the banh mi, while not exceptional, does satisfy a craving when it hits. Overall, this place is a solid choice for anyone in the neighborhood looking for decent fare.",1

159,"It's rustic and charming and even has a communal table, where we sat today.  Kind of a 'secret' brunch spot. The menu at noon on a Sunday is the same as any other time - but there are always (I'm told) two egg dishes available off-menu. It worked for us very well at both our Sunday brunch time visits. Picture a little dish of oil drizzled olives on a wooden table and Tuscan style bread to die for with that beautiful chewy crust and meltingly soft interior. It's $2 for the bread but so worth it and they'll bring all you want. Have a steaming Americano pressed just for you.Food is exquisite. Look at the photos. Taste and quality are every bit as high quality as the presentation.Service fell short of perfect but still very good. There's a good number of sidewalk tables as well as a private room.

Super crisp, chewy (in the best way), and texturally perfect crust.I love their spicy chicken pizza, and the half size is perfect for a slightly small lunch, or in my case a very late lunch that nearly intersects with dinner.

Boqueria works well for dates, date nights, small group dinners, and post-work happy hour sipping + gnoshing. make reservations for dinner--waits can be very long.tip: happy hour prices are only at the drinks bar NOT at any of the tables or the chef's bar seats.the food? really damn good. depending on the tapas that you're ordering and your hunger level, sharing 6 tapas between two people for dinner is a good bet to fill your stomach with delicious eats. honestly, if you get the paella. i'd order the charcuterie or 1-2 tapas.tapas recommendations:*escalivada: fire-roasted eggplant, labneh, herbs + flatbread. so much mediterranean flavor packed into this simple dish.*patatas bravos: crispy potatoes, salsa, garlic aioli. crunch tater carbs. *croquetas cremosas: 3 creamy serrano ham + 3 creamy mushroom croquettes.*gambas al ajillo: the shrimps are great, but the brothy sauce is what makes this dish amazing.*pulpo a la plancha. perfectly cooked. the grilled charring on the octopus adds that extra edge of flavor. comes with fennel on a small potato bed*nutella churros: room for dessert? order these ""doughnuts.' comes out piping hot, filled with nutella. the sweet life.the service is prompt and friendly. however the service seems attentive when you place your initial drink and food orders. otherwise, as the night moves on...your server will be hard to find. i would say if you're here for a birthday celebration and note it in your reservation, OpenTable, etc...you need to remind them to candle/sparkler the dessert as they don't seem to pay attention to the original reservation. they comp nothing on celebrations etc. expect to drop about $75-$100 (inclusive of tax & tip) per person if you're drinking with dinner.drops mic cuz i'm tapas dancing on deliciousnessi outzzz",0

There will be someone there to greet you, so no worries about figuring out which painting opens. It's a very intimate spot. It's basically like 1 long bar. I did notice a table for a group near the back. It was quiet, the service was excellent, the food incredible. If you have any dietary restrictions, let them know ahead of time and they'll accommodate. I'm a pescatarian and there was no problem substituting the meat course, just let them know when you make the reservation.Onto the food. This is a tasting menu, so I'm sure it changes up a bit. I won't go into a huge amount of detail here since the dishes may change. It's a 5 course tasting menu, you'll get an amuse bouche to start. They also offer wine pairing and a cheese plate. I went all out and did the wine pairing and we also got the cheese plate. All of the food was incredible. Every.bite. We had a Hummus and Quiona salad, followed by Lobster, Fluke, Halibut, my friend had Chicken while I had Scallops, closed out with a cheese plate and Dulche de Leche. Highly recommend.",0

3386,"Title: A Tasty Surprise at Chick'nCone in the Buzzing Food Hall

My adventure to Chick'nCone last Saturday proved to be a delightful discovery, nestled in the bustling environment of a food hall at 5:00pm. Although getting there was a mini-quest of its own—thanks to a slightly misleading Google Maps and a somewhat hidden location downstairs by the subway turnstiles—finding the spot was part of the fun.

Once there, I dived into their signature Chick'nCone with Kick'nRanch sauce. The waffle was a joy—perfectly cooked and flavorful—while the chicken boasted a gratifying crunch, complemented by the bold and zesty sauce that truly lived up to its name. 

My only quibble is with the chicken-to-waffle ratio; as much as I savored the combination, the last few bites were a solo act of waffle, leaving me craving a bit more of that delicious chicken to round off the experience. Here's hoping for a better balance next time, because there will definitely be a next time.",1
15472,"Delicious Italian food here! We went in on a Friday night without reservation and got seated in about 10 mins with a host saying that they can only allow an hour of dining time. We took that option and this place serves food with the speed that New Yorker needs!! We felt a little rushed but overall it was a pretty good dining experience. The cocktails are delicious. We got the sweet and smoky and the cucumber gin. They gave us garlic bread and three types of hummus. The appetizers we had are chicken meatballs and the grilled octopus. The chicken meatballs are filled with cheese. Personally I like the grilled octopus more because I think the chicken meatballs were a little too creamy. For main courses, we split the lobster pasta and the drunken golden bird. The lobster pasta was fantastic and the chicken cutlet was also juicy and delicious. There were a lot of tables open around us but I think they were reserved. The tables were empty the entire time we were there! I think the restaurant is still fairly new and trying to figure out managing tables. I just wish we weren't rushed with everything because there were empty tables around! (Thus the minus one star for this restaurant).",0
16039,"I was getting a haircut nearby and told my friends, ""Take me to a place where I can eat oysters and look cute"". They took me here and all my requirements were met!On a sunny day in early summer, right before everyone is covered in sweat and oozing aggression, we sat in a window seat and ordered french fries, pancetta and garlic brussels sprouts, jalapeno corn bread with honey butter, cod fritters, and their Le Jeffrey seafood tower (16 oysters, 8 littlenecks, 8 shrimp cocktail, 1/2 lobster, 1/2 king crab legs, marinated mussels, salmon tartar, and scallops with orange and cucumber). There were four of us and this was the perfect amount of food to start with. You can order the fries sprinkled with old bay space which we did, and they come with ketchup and an aioli. They are delicious fries, crispy well spiced, very tasty- but they are $9 for a small portion. I'd like to see them lower the price or make the portion bigger. The cod fritters had chunks of fish inside of them, not little specks, served with a lightly flavored remoulade and arugula, it's the perfect combination of fried, creamy, crunchy. Brussels sprouts were cooked perfectly and the pancetta was not tossed on in such a huge amount that you could no longer taste the vegetable, excellent. You can't really taste the jalapeno in the cornbread, and it's a soft corn bread, with the honey butter almost chunky and more honey than butter. It was tasty but too sweet for me. The seafood tower was incredible. Excellent selections of fresh, quality seafood. These are the best raw clams I've ever had, usually I find them too fishy but these were perfectly balanced with a subtle sweetness. The scallops were standouts too, massive in size and practically melting in your mouth. My entree was their salmon with chopped asparagus, shiitakes, and a pea puree. I loved how the asparagus rods were cut into smaller pieces, allowing you to get a piece with each bite of salmon. The fish itself was cooked beyond tender, it was so unbelievably moist and flaky, I don't think I'll ever get the same results in my own kitchen! The puree and fresh vegetables pushed the whole thing over the top, I also recommend this dish. Their drinks were the only real misses. Their non-alcoholic drinks (Island Moon DJ & You're Hired & Getting a Raise!) were either overpowered by one ingredient (the former, looking at you lime), or too mellow with no flavors taking charge (the latter). I also tried Tulum with Love and El Diablo, both of which seemed to be balanced to the point of every ingredients cancelling each other out. Also, the seats are a little uncomfortable (backless wood stools and wooden booths with no cushions). Not a huge problem but we were all grateful to stand and walk around a bit afterwards. This has definitely been added to my roster of favorites. Service was fast and attentive with smiles and patience, and the music was also great (chill R&B and rock). Go!",0
15903,"Title: A Cozy Corner of Culinary Comfort at 2nd Ave Deli

During a brisk evening in the Upper East Side, a craving for classic deli fare led me to discover the gem that is the 2nd Ave Deli (ironically now located on 1st Ave). Branded as ""Jewish Penicillin,"" their Matzoh Ball Soup isn't just a dish; it's an experience I've raved about non-stop. Each spoonful was a warm embrace, making it unquestionably the best I've ever tasted.

The deli didn't stop impressing there; the chicken liver was delectable, highlighting their commitment to authentic flavors. To top off an already delightful meal, a complimentary chocolate shot was the sweet exclamation point I never knew I needed.

Service was top-notch, attentive without being overbearing, and the ambience struck the perfect balance between lively and cozy, making solo dining an absolute pleasure. The 2nd Ave Deli is a place of no frills but all thrills for the palate, and without a doubt, has become my go-to spot in the city.

Final Verdict: CHEERS to 2nd Ave Deli, where the soup soothes, the liver delights, and the chocolate sweetly lingers.",1

Their Kale & Brussels Salad, priced at $10, is a delightful alternative to the usual healthy offerings, standing out from competitors like Sweetgreen. On the downside, their $8.50 Cauliflower Rice, while flavorful, had a consistency too mushy for my liking. Despite that, the restaurant shows promise, and I'm open to returning when in need of a health-conscious bite.",1
20678,"Title: A Taste of Africa in the Heart of Manhattan: Benyam Cuisine Review

My culinary journey through African cuisine continued splendidly in Manhattan, where Benyam Cuisine stood as my latest expedition. The ambiance of the place was lively and welcoming, a perfect prelude to the gastronomic experience that awaited.

I indulged in the siga wot, a flavorful and spicy stew that challenged my palate with its unique blend of spices. Accompanying it were the mesir wot and denich wot, the former infusing the meal with a delightful lentil twist, and the latter bringing a comforting mix of potatoes and carrots to the table.

Portion sizes at Benyam were nothing short of generous. The meal I ordered was so abundant that it spanned two hearty servings. This aspect certainly made the wait of under 30 minutes for prep and delivery feel even more worth it.

While the presentation was simple, the dishes' flavors were anything but. I regretted that the photo I took couldn't quite encapsulate the vibrancy of the meal – the food was, without exaggeration, sensational.

Benyam Cuisine has certainly cemented itself as a must-visit spot for African food lovers in Manhattan. With its delicious offerings, I'm already planning my next visit for when I return to the city. For those looking to dive into African dishes, look no further; Benyam will not disappoint.",1
17456,"Title: A Delightful First Experience at Tri Dim Shanghai

I recently tried Tri Dim Shanghai for takeout and was pleasantly surprised with their attention to detail. I ordered the shrimp fried rice that was promptly ready within 30 minutes—a quick turnaround for a Friday night.

Upon getting home, I appreciated how they packaged the utensils, sauces, napkins, and the fortune cookie in a small ziplock bag—neat and practical compared to the usual jumble of items in the bag at other places.

The shrimp fried rice met my expectations, tasting authentic and satisfyingly fresh, with all the shrimp thoughtfully deveined. It's a small touch, but it speaks volumes of the care they put into their cooking.

However, there was a slight downside. Despite the promising message in my fortune, ""There is a sparkle in my eye,"" the accompanying cookie was a letdown due to its staleness—quite the contrast to the freshness of the meal.

Overall, Tri Dim Shanghai earns my commendation for its food and presentation, with just a minor hiccup on the fortune cookie—one that won't deter me from ordering again.",1
17207,"Title: A Culinary Gem with Room for Service Polish

Upon my recent visit to this establishment, I was greeted by a culinary celebration of Indian gastronomy. The NIZAMS HALEEM from the large plates section was a standout, executed with such finesse that it transported me straight to the heart of India with its complex flavors and rich textures. However, a note on service – while enthusiasm is appreciated, clarity is paramount. A simple inquiry about the protein in the Haleem led to an unnecessary culinary lecture without ever revealing the meat used, paired with a rather presumptuous remark implying common knowledge of the dish's contents.

Other dishes, although their names escape me, resonated with the same quality and authenticity as the Haleem, leaving a lasting impression of the kitchen's capabilities. Visual aids are at hand, as I have captured the artistry of the meals in photos alongside this review.

The dessert menu did not inspire the same excitement, prompting me to conclude the meal without a sweet finale. In summary, while the food receives top marks, the service experience could benefit from more direct communication and attentiveness to customer queries.",1

20874,"I was SO looking forward to amazing Chinese food while in NYC, and after reading the other reviews for Dim Sum Palace, I thought we had a winner.  We went twice, and the inconsistency left we very disappointed.The first time we went was pretty late, but the restaurant is open super late, too.  We were seated quickly, but given an abbreviated menu.  We ordered off the dim sum menu - pork buns, chicken dumplings, and spring rolls.  We both stayed with water, as the tea options were very limited.  The food was good!  Like real good.  Service was ok, but not awesome.  We decided we should come back again.The next time we came, we got the full menu.  We ordered the easy choices: black tea, Kung pao chicken, pork lo mein, shrimp dumplings, and chicken dumplings.  The tea was fresh and hot.  The dumplings were weird (actually kind of gross).  The wrapper texture was actually slimy and unappealing.  The lo mein and Kung pao were good, but not the best I ever had.  The service was ok.  Oh, and it was Friday night, but it wasn't that busy.The inconsistency and scary dumplings is why this restaurant is getting only two stars.",0

If you're in the mood for scrumptious empanadas, look no further. I recently indulged in what can only be described as a culinary delight—the Hawaiian pizza empanada. With its perfectly crispy crust and succulent filling, it's a standout that's neither too greasy nor too heavy, making it dangerously easy to overindulge. I've yet to explore the full menu, but this gem of a spot has undoubtedly earned a place on my radar. Conveniently located by my hair salon, the temptation for repeat visits is strong. One thing is certain: a ""happy belly"" is guaranteed.",1
2326,"Title: Another Letdown at Local Applebee's

My latest visit to this particular Applebee's location reaffirmed my bewilderment at why I keep giving it another chance. The service remains consistently lackluster, with unnecessary waiting periods despite numerous vacant tables, and once seated, it feels like a game of hide and seek to find your server.

During my visit, with a mere four family groups in our section, it took the waiter an astonishing 10 minutes before even approaching us to take our order. We opted for the pricier-than-average unlimited combo, paying $10 more per person than the national rate—hard to swallow, to say the least.

Both my wife and I ordered different items, but when it came to a second helping, our waiter made an unfounded assumption to repeat our initial choices without inquiry. His persistence on selling dessert was also baffling, especially when we were there to enjoy the ""unlimited"" aspect of our meal, not an endless supply of fries, which accumulated at an absurd rate.

In summary, the Brooklyn location will be my go-to from now on, as the extra distance seems a small price to pay for potentially better service and the unlimited experience I actually desire.",1
10548,"Title: Pleasant Surprises During Happy Hour at The Local Spot

I recently visited The Local Spot during their daily happy hour (5pm-8pm) and had quite the enjoyable experience. Starting with an old fashioned, priced fairly at $8, it was a tad sweeter than usual but hit the spot. My following drink, the Pineapple Express ($9), didn't disappoint with its sweet, tropical vibe - a foolproof option for pineapple lovers.

Next up, the Bar Belly Penicillin ($8), which struck a perfect balance with its in-house made ginger syrup, not too overpowering as ginger can sometimes be. Kudos to Gin, the bartender, for his mixology prowess and engaging company.

The happy hour cocktail menu, although limited, didn’t skimp on quality. I indulged in the $1 oysters which were a bit on the small side but still a bargain for happy hour.

While the ambiance was laid-back at 5pm, Gin mentioned the weekend transformation with live music and a club-like atmosphere, which I'm tempted to return for.

Finally, a special mention to the complimentary popcorn - a snack I typically avoid but was convinced to try here. Seasoned with truffle oil and a hint of sugar, it was unexpectedly delicious, warranting its reputation as some of the ""best popcorn"" customers have had.

Overall, The Local Spot offers a great happy hour experience that’s both affordable and high-quality, with an ambiance that caters to various moods throughout the week.",1

This isn't real Italian gelato but just some American knock off and they're all about Instagram and the cute heart-shaped whatever to post in your pictures, while the product itself is really mediocre...And the reason people love it so much is because people just cannot tell the difference. If you were Italian you'd get it. You're not, so you don't. Not if you like Amorino, anyway.If you can't tell the difference between gelato and ice cream and good stuff and bad stuff you probably shouldn't be on Yelp - but that's what Yelp is - it gives everybody a voice and that's why this place comes across as really popular when it's really crap.",0

Whenever my travels bring me from Houston to Soho, Chow House is a must-visit on my dining itinerary. This restaurant's excellent fare draws me back time and again, with its casual, unhurried atmosphere offering a refreshing alternative to the more frenetic pace of its Michelin-starred counterparts like Cafe China.

The menu is a treasure trove of Szechuan delights, and there are a few standout dishes that I can't resist ordering on repeat visits. The Szechuan Wontons and Steamed Vegetable Dumplings are always a great start, while the Chongqing Spicy Chicken and the Braised Fish in Chili Broth never fail to tantalize with their bold flavors and perfect execution.

Beyond the food, Chow House offers a reasonable selection of wines and beers to complement your meal. Coupled with their fantastic service, this Soho Szechuan spot is a culinary highlight not to be missed.",1

2699,"Participants in the NYC restaurant week - we made reservations for 8pm on a Monday. The place was lively (but not loud), warm and inviting - perfect for a cold New York night. Service was great: attentive, yet chill servers who do not interrupt their guests.

The total bill for 2, ran $140-ish (because drinks).Our starters were French onion soup and Brussels sprouts Caesar salad - both very tasty, but the hot and cold salad takes the gold: a must try (and I had it sans croutons - as gluten makes me sick). The mains: although the Trout dish was more photogenic, the Pork Adobo surpasses the vanity by a few points in overall flavor - bc I'm a softy for anything avocado, and I kept stealing it off hubby's plate. The cocktails in between the meals were delicious: the Flatiron, Pamplemousse (not on the menu, but requested), and the Oldfashioned on tap (!!) - the ""on-tap"" part, my husband now wants at home.The Chocolate Crème dessert was decadent (I want THAT on tap!!).",0

16052,Had a great time with friends trying this award winning ramen place located in the back of the lobby at Wyndham hotel on Bowery in Chinatown.The restaurant doesn't accept reservations. We got lucky to score the last table of four in the back of the restaurant when I got there around 6:15pm on a weekday as the place is small. Glad I didn't need to wait for the entire party to show up in order to be seated. It might be different if the place got busy. Service was quick and attentive. Appetizers were awesome especially with the happy hour prices. Got an order of free edamame with yelp check-in. The lobster and spicy tuna tacos were delicious. The shishito peppers were a bit spicy for me but my friends loved it. The kakuni bao was tasty too. We all opted for the bone marrow ramen and added an egg. The broth was a bit greasy and salty but overall good. The beef was very tender. Unfortunately I couldn't really taste much of the bone marrow (you scraped it down to the soup) as there was more bone than marrow. There is a special menu with decent prices after 9pm if you are a night owl.,0

But when it came to taste it was yummy but average. Nothing that blew me away. The pad Thai is a little on the sweeter side. But the position is massive. The spring rolls come in hot crispy and fresh (4 pieces) but they are stuffed with a lot of vermicelli and cabbage and not much vegetables. Still good tho! All in all decent prices for nyc. You can get an entree for 14-15$,0

Opted for the Thai chicken with quinoa, which proved to be quite flavorful, albeit in need of a bit more seasoning to enhance the taste. The dish occasionally veered towards blandness.

14457,"Title: Consistently Delightful Eats at Westville

Westville remains a staple for dependably scrumptious meals, covering both lunch and dinner with flair. Their broad menu always entices with something fresh to experience. This spacious outlet trumps others in size, basking in natural light and hosting a full bar, which is a welcome feature.

Booking through Opentable adds convenience to the dining experience. While the menu might appear simple, each dish is executed with a level of finesse that elevates the flavors. The egg scramble is a brunch highlight, whereas the kale salad (enhanced with chicken), turkey burger, and vegan quinoa burger stand out in the dinner offerings.

The market platter is a steal at $18, offering a choice of four vegetables; the green beans being a personal favorite. If you've got room for dessert, the whoopie pies will deftly satisfy those sugary cravings. Westville is a testament to how simplicity, when done right, can shine in the culinary world.",1

At a dollar a slice, it's a no-frills experience where you get precisely what you pay for: an okay pizza that doesn't stand out from the crowd, but doesn't disappoint either. The cheese, sauce, and toppings offer an average taste that neither excites the palate nor turns it away.

15630,"Title: A Delightful Anniversary Dinner with a Gourmet Touch

My partner and I recently celebrated our anniversary at this charming restaurant and were treated to a sumptuous 6-course tasting menu that left our taste buds dancing with joy. While there were minute hiccups in service, the overall experience was impressive.

Upon arrival, the seating arrangement was immediately adjusted at our request from a middle table to a more private corner one, a move that seemed like it could have been the original offering. A thoughtful touch of complimentary Prosecco set a celebratory tone for the evening.

The culinary journey began with a warm cabbage broth that astonished us with its rich flavors. The fluke crudo that followed was a delight, though some pieces were slightly stringy. A timing misstep occurred when our seared scallops arrived before the wine service, but this was a minor distraction from the otherwise delectable scallops.

The Arctic char, initially ordinary on its own, transformed into a flavorful ensemble on the plate. We savored two pasta variations—the squid ink with lobster and another infused with comte cheese and white truffles, the latter for an additional fee. Both were divine.

The beef course that concluded the savory portion of the menu was impeccable—a testament to the chef's mastery of seasoning and cookery. A refreshing palate cleanser of apple and pomegranate prepared us for the final sweet notes of the meal. The poached pears with their unexpected crunch surprised me, though my husband was quite pleased. A surprise coconut cake in honor of our anniversary was a delectable treat, notwithstanding my husband's aversion to coconut, leaving me to indulge happily.

Our evening concluded with chocolate truffles and mini chocolate chip banana bread loaves to take home, a thoughtful end to our celebration.

Throughout the evening, the service was attentive but never intrusive, striking the right balance of care and discretion. Despite a few small hitches, our anniversary dinner was a fantastic experience, and the flavors we encountered will linger as fond memories.",1
10556,"My friend and I came here for dinner and had a great time! We shared the following:1. Bubby Meyer's ""chopped liver"" pate - the lentil and sunflower seed pâté was smooth and dense and paired extremely well with the caramelized onions. I really appreciated flavors as they were simply natural and true. 2. Mama's meatball parm - it smelled exactly like regular meatball parm! We had it with beet ""noodles"" (beedles? boodles...?) and I have to say, I had never been a fan of beets but this dish changed my mind. The ""meatball"" was clearly made of rice and lentils and wasn't intended to remind you of meat, but it was tasty for what it was. The spicy Sicilian sauce was legit.3. Mexican latkes - this tapa came with 3 latkes and a coconut sour cream dip. The latkes reminded me a bit of falafels but had a smoother texture inside. The coconut sour cream was so good that I'd choose it over regular sour cream any day. 4. Truffle fries - the name is misleading as the tapa is really a plate of potatoes. The black truffle oil wasn't too prominent. 5. French lentil meatloaf - very similar to the meatball parm.6. Kale casaer with tempeh - so simple yet so flavorful. The tempeh was nicely marinated with a hint of citrus flavor. 7. Lemongrass red curry - thank god for coconut milk/cream. The flavor was more natural and subtle than that of regular Thai red curries. 8. Pumpkin cheesecake - made with chickpeas and topped with coconut cream. We debated between this and the regular coconut milk cheesecake and decided to go with the seasonal offering and were very content.The restaurant is quite small and cozy. I do recommend making a reservation, which can be easily done via email.",0

My meal was not bad at all . I would say though that they did too much with their seasonings . The rice for example was very saturated with what seemed like lemon juice . The sauces were good but would have preferred them on the side as a dip . The meats were cooked very well (tried the chicken and steak) but was a smaller portion than I'm used to in similar restaurants . The veggies were also good except for their kale but got lost in the complexity and non complimentary flavors of the food .    I'd surmise that this restaurant is good .

Our visit to this cool-looking German pub during Oktoberfest was a journey of highs and lows. The good? An impressive selection of German beers that beckoned us with the promise of an authentic experience. The bad? A dinner platter that was hit and miss.

The centerpiece, a pig foot (or its neighbor), was a disappointing foray into the unfamiliar. It lacked the flavor complexity one craves in cooking that dares to trot out the trotters, and the texture left much to be desired. However, the bier brats and bacon provided redemption with their savory notes, and the potatoes were a comforting staple done right.

The service was competent but carried an air of detachment, lacking the warmth you'd expect in such a festive setting. Although the prices were mostly reasonable, the platter didn't quite justify its cost, imparting a lesson on sticking to what you know - like the trusty wiener schnitzel we eyed on a neighboring table.

Ending on a high note, the giant, steaming-hot pretzels served as a delectable consolation prize, making us wish we had opened with them instead.

In sum, while this visit earns 3 stars, it's a reminder that sometimes simpler is better, especially when venturing into the hearty world of German cuisine.",1
14846,"Tucked away in a modest nook of the city, I discovered a culinary gem aptly named ""Handmade Noodles."" True to its moniker, the restaurant served up the best Chinese noodles my palate has ever relished - marvelously chewy and impressively long, evoking the traditions of Chinese New Year.

We indulged in the beef and tendon stir-fried hand-pulled noodles, a dish where each component maintained its texture - the beef was tender but not mushy, and the tendons added a pleasant chewiness, leaving us craving more. Complementing our noodle experience were the pork and chive potstickers, eight pieces of juicy goodness with a perfectly seared crust, all at the steal of $4.

An added bonus? The option to bring home 50 frozen potstickers for a mere $12. A word of advice for future visitors: scan the wall for specials. I regretfully missed out on the soup dumplings amid my contentment and subsequent dessert plans in Little Italy. This no-frills spot is a must-visit for noodle aficionados, and my only lament is not being able to transport its delights back to Florida.",1
12023,"During our recent bar-hopping adventure in downtown New York, we stumbled upon a delightful spot that's a must-visit. The ambiance is cozy, with decor that transports you to a charmingly unique setting. Drinks won't break the bank, and the service is commendably fast. If you’re planning a night out in the area, be sure to add this gem to your list.",1
14099,"Title: A Gem in Javits Center - Agape Cafe

I recently visited Agape Cafe while working at the NY Boat Show in the Javits Center and was surprised to see it had a couple of low-score reviews. It's important to note that this is a bustling food court spot, where affordability and quick service are king. Despite a small line, the interaction between the staff – presumably the owner or manager – and customers was notably warm and efficient.

When it came time to place my order, it was prepared promptly, and I was pleasantly surprised to receive a discount due to my exhibitor status at the boat show. The prices were very fair, particularly for a venue like Javits where costs can skyrocket. My gyro, generously portioned and flavorful, was only $9.75 and nearly defeated my appetite despite my having skipped meals prior.

The menu also boasts salads and sides, like a tempting spinach pie. Overall, the Agape Cafe provided a heartening experience where customer care was evidently a priority. I’ll gladly return on my next visit to the Javits Center and highly recommend it to others seeking a tasty, reasonably priced meal in the area.",1

20713,"One of the best pizza spots in NYC. Famous for the sicilian square with lots of thick pepperoni on top. However, their round pies are also good and the regular cheese slice is good as well.

1492,"Title: A Delightful Symphony of Culinary Excellence at Le Coucou

My dining experience at Le Coucou oscillated between a strong four and a perfect five-star rating. Ultimately, I must tip my hat to their Michelin-starred prowess, as the food and ambiance ignited an irresistible charm deserving of high praise.

Upon arrival, the fashionable crowd and equally stylish staff provide a striking introduction to this chic eatery. A $58 two-course meal with an additional $15 for a succulent Filet de boeuf 'Bourse et la Vie' was a price well paid for the symphony of flavors we experienced.

Our unanimous choice led us through a journey starting with a remarkable Terrine de fruits et légumes au foie gras, interspersed with celeriac, pears, sherry vinaigrette, and hazelnuts. The main course did not disappoint, with a prime filet drenched in a divine sauce au poivre, accompanied by the quintessential pommes frites. Dessert was a decadent affair, featuring Chocolat Noir with salted caramel ice cream and a classic Paris-Brest filled with hazelnut praline.

Service was impeccable throughout our culinary adventure, with a waitstaff that showcased proficiency and decorum that were simply delightful. However, there was a slight tarnish to the experience - an interaction with the front-of-house staff left something to be desired. A misunderstanding at the hostess stand suggested a need for improved training, especially considering the establishment's price point.

Despite this hiccup, the expertise of Chef and the waitstaff shone brightly. They delivered a stellar performance that earns Le Coucou a resounding five stars in my book. I highly recommend indulging in the pleasure of dining here; just be prepared for potential front-of-house foibles.",1
20588,"Came here since it was part of the bib gournamnd. Got two pastas salty roe and the oxtail ragu.None of these satisfied me...I thought the noodles would be the star of the show as that's usually the case in pasta. However, these were just tough and bland. Not a lot of flavor or good texture in either of these pasta noodles. The salty roe sauce...was salty and reminded me of more asian cuisine than Italian, and it doesn't do either well. The ragu sauce was pretty standard, except for the bites in which I got actual oxtail pieces (veryyyy stingy amount). The oxtail seemed to be flavored very well, but maybe it was the shock that there was actually any oxtail at all that made me excited.The service here is amazing, and I loved that part. The food....left a lot to be desired.",0
1416,"I have been craving Wah Fung after seeing Food Insider videos, Fung Bros videos, and tons of great Yelp reviews about this place. We walked through the city on a very hot and sunny day to get here, and were met with no line and a subpar meal. It is worth noting that the chef is extremely skilled and fast and that all the meat is definitely fresh!We ordered a small roast duck and a small roast pork, which both came with cabbage and white rice, as well as a spoonful of sauce. We will get to this sauce later. There is NO seating space around Wah Fung, and all orders are take out. Since we wanted to eat immediately, we went across the street to the Hester St. Playground/Park. Do not do this - the tables are all directly in the sunlight and the benches are super dirty. We sat at a table and suffered through the heat to eat.. and we were really not impressed. The duck meat was pretty rough, and while the pork meat was okay, I have had way better. In addition, the pork meat had no flavor at all. Even with the minimal amount of sauce (that I suspect soaked into the rice), it was bland and kind of dry. The vegetables and rice also did not taste like anything, showing that this place really is just a cheap meal in Chinatown. The portion size looks good but most of the dish is just filler rice. Would not come back :(",0
11306,"I visited this restaurant in search of some comforting eats while preparing for finals and, unfortunately, left disappointed. Despite having checked the reviews in advance, the reality did not meet expectations. The price for a kimbap and ddukbokki side set seemed steep at $11.99, especially when more affordable options are available in ktown. I took the plunge, opting for beef kimbap, but my initial letdown was compounded by the sight of flies hovering over the food displayed in hot trays, a clear red flag.

Reluctantly, I decided against canceling my order due to hunger and had the food packaged to go. By the time I arrived home, the ddukbokki had leaked from its container. The beef in the kimbap was distractingly sweet and the rice, unfortunately overcooked, although the toppings were plentiful. Contrary to other reviews, my portion had an adequate number of rice cakes but was missing egg, and the ddukbokki itself was overly sweet with a lack of spice and contained no seafood, just a few thin slices of fish cake.

Regrettably, I cannot see myself returning with so many other choices available in ktown. For the sake of their patrons, I sincerely hope they address the fly issue and improve their food’s quality.",1
15807,"Title: Consistent Quality and Exceptional Service

My latest dining experiences at this spot have been a delightful journey through their mouth-watering menu. From their perfectly paired chicken and waffles to the creamy mac and cheese and the savory crispness of the bacon, each dish is a hit. Their pancakes are fluffy comfort on a plate, while the grilled octopus is a testament to the kitchen's finesse with diverse flavors. Complementing the meal with fresh-squeezed orange and grapefruit juice, you really can't go wrong here.

What sets this restaurant apart is the consistently excellent service. Every visit is met with staff who truly go above and beyond to ensure a pleasant experience. Their attention to detail and willingness to accommodate shines brightly, making me look forward to my next meal here. Highly recommended for those who value great food paired with top-notch service!",1
11393,"First time here, very pleased!DECOR: dim lighting, italian decor, lots of art on the walls... nice place for a date night.FOOD: upon seating we were given a bread basket and some oil. Ordered the Garlic Bread, Meatball Pizza, and the Pepperoni Chicken Parmesan. Food came out pretty quick, garlic bread was good but would have been better with a little cheese on it! The Pepperoni Chicken Parm was really good, big size (3 of us shared it). Same for the Meatball Pizza, it was pretty large so 3 of us shared that as well. My only complaint with the Meatball Pizza was that a few of the meatballs weren't cooked fully.DRINK: ordered moscow mules which tasted very good, but for $17 a cocktail we all kind of agreed it wasn't really worth it. Didn't seem to have much alcohol in them.DESSERT: since we were there for a birthday we ordered a dessert platter with a variety of tasty items... Cannoli's, a large slice of Lemon Meringue Pie, slice of Tiramisu, and a slice of some other tart lemon type pie. The Tiramisu was a favorite, as were the Cannolis.All in all our dinner here was very good. Also, the staff were great. During dessert time we were given a complimentary sample of a Limoncello and also some oatmeall cookies. I thought that was very nice of them to give us those samples for free. I would definitely return next time I'm in NYC.",0
1532,"I had high hopes for this restaurant based on a friend's recommendation and positive reviews, but I left somewhat disappointed. We ordered the ""Shio Black"" from the top of the menu, which comes in non-spicy and spicy variants. The spicy one, which isn't all that hot, is preferable to the bland non-spicy option. Although the noodles were well-prepared and the egg was perfectly cooked, the soup base lacked an impressive flavor and the pork was unremarkable.

Unfortunately, I experienced extreme thirst for hours afterwards, suggesting the possibility of excessive MSG in their dishes. The setting is a cozy space with fewer than twenty seats, including a small bar area, but the service is quick. We visited early Monday evening, were seated immediately, and received our ramen promptly. Note that this is a cash-only establishment.",1
17823,"Title: A Slice of Heaven Amidst the Hustle

I reserve my 5-star reviews for truly exceptional offerings, and the hot honey slice at this pizzeria earns it without question. Imagine a perfectly crispy crust, topped with creamy fresh ricotta, beautifully complemented by a drizzle of sweet and spicy hot honey. It's a masterpiece of flavors that has easily become one of my top pizza choices in the city.

While the pizzeria's proximity to the chaotic Penn Station area isn't ideal, the place itself exudes an old-school charm that's as authentic as it gets for a no-frills pizza joint. Should you find yourself navigating the nearby commotion, do yourself a favor and drop by for this unforgettable slice. It's more than just a meal—it's an experience worth savoring.",1
12703,"Good Ramen. We had Vegetable ramen (since my friend was vegetarian) and I had Pork Miso Ramen. Portion is right and price is average for NYC. Place was nicely decorated and servers are nice. There was not much else for vegetarian to eat. Food was good, miso and content for that soup was nice. Noodle was soft and thin just right. I would stop by again if I walked around that neighborhood again. We went to Central Park and we walked around found this place by accident, which we thought as a nice place.",0
14284,"This place is more like 4.5 stars than 4. Everything I have had here in the past few months has been excellent from their chocolate cake to their mini pumpkin bunt cake and their red velvet cupcakes. I came in on Thanksgiving to pick up a pumpkin cheesecake and it was also quite tasty. I am gluten free so I really appreciate this place and don't feel like I am missing out. Their stuff is also perfect for gatherings. Everything is also dairy free FYI.  Even if you are not gf or dairy free you will still enjoy this place...promise. Staff is helpful, I have only had one annoying experience when I  trying to pick out a chocolate cake for my birthday, I asked if I told them what I wanted if they could help suggest something and instead they just gave me a big book to look through (sigh). Anyway, amazing options for Thanksgiving including cornbread and dinner rolls too. Next year I will get my order in early.",0
11887,"On a brisk, rainy day, I found solace in the warmth of a delightful pork and shrimp dumpling soup at a local eatery. The soup struck me as genuinely authentic, with a comforting, homestyle execution that promised an adventure in every spoonful. The dumplings were an impeccable blend of succulent pork and tender shrimp, swimming in a savory broth that perfectly balanced the flavors. This pleasant experience has sparked my curiosity, and I find myself eager to return and explore more of their seemingly authentic offerings.",1
15087,"Title: A Longtime Favorite for Vietnamese Cuisine

I've been a regular at this Vietnamese gem since childhood, and it remains a top pick anytime I'm nearby. The spacious setup ensures personal space, a detail I always appreciate. Familiar, efficient staff add a touch of warmth to each visit.

My go-to dish, the #1 Xe Lua, is a pho-lover's delight, brimming with noodles, beef, tripe, and tendon. It arrives with a fresh side of bean sprouts and lime for customization. A tip for newcomers: the beef is served slightly raw, so let it simmer in the broth to your liking.

For both taste and value, this spot is unbeatable. Whether you're a pho aficionado or new to Vietnamese cuisine, this restaurant is sure to become a favorite on your list as well.",1

17032,"Title: A Casual Evening at the Neighborhood Joint

During a recent outing in the neighborhood, we stumbled upon this eatery just as happy hour concluded—a pity, as a grace period for that last-minute round would have been appreciated, but, alas, we paid full price for our beverages. The Montauk pumpkin ale I sipped was pleasingly chilled, and my companion’s Mojito hit the spot as well.

We were greeted with toasted bread, a simple yet welcoming start, which paired splendidly with the accompanying shrimp sauce. Our appetite was further indulged with Cuban sliders, whose flavorful profile delighted us, and the Shrimp al Ajillo was a garlic-infused treat. The Yuca fries, chunky and satisfying, came with a tasty dipping sauce.

While the ambiance benefited from a good music selection, the service was underwhelming, lacking in proactive engagement—catching a server’s eye was requisite for any additional requests. Nonetheless, the prices didn’t break the bank, rendering our overall experience as pleasantly reasonable.",1
13742,"Sometimes you just need some good pizza, and Prince Street Pizza is where it's at! My first time trying the Spicy Spring Square and it was a 10/10. The pepperoni's were delicious and crust, sauce & cheese were all perfection. Truly the best square I've ever had!! We tried a margarita slice too and it was okay, kinda of a sweetness to it but I can definitely see why they are known for their squares. My new go-to!!",0
16065,"Title: A Memorable Culinary Experience on Madison Avenue

My recent visit to this gem on Madison Avenue was an absolute delight, starting from its exceptional location to the attentive service we received throughout our meal. The evening kicked off with a robust Barolo wine, setting the stage for an indulgent dining experience.

We sampled a trio of appetizers: fried calamari, yellow tail sashimi, and grilled octopus. Although I found the calamari a tad too salty and lacking a complementary dipping sauce, the sashimi and octopus were pleasures to the palate.

The main event, a grilled shrimp dish, was cooked to perfection, so much so that I regretted not being able to finish it all. We also shared a creamy risotto, a testament to the kitchen’s skill in classic Italian fare. Kudos to the waitstaff for managing our plentiful order on a single table with finesse.

Dessert was the crowning touch - a plate of lightly dusted biscotti that proved irresistible, followed by a second helping brought out without prompt. We indulged in a decadent chocolate cake and a meringue cake, ethereal in its lightness. I concluded the meal with a glass of Frangelico, opting out of the Limoncello.

This restaurant is a must-visit for anyone seeking a memorable dining experience. I'm eagerly anticipating my next meal here.",1
1061,"The oyster bar at Grand Central is certainly grand. Best to make a reservation as the place gets packed during meal-hour times. The restaurant has 3 large sections for seating, oyster bar, and a drinks bar. The drinks were okay, nothing out of the ordinary. The oysters were all fresh and we tried one of each kind they had. A little Sandy though, could've used some washing beforehand. We also ordered a fresh steamed lobster which we could pick from the tank. Service was good and timely. The restroom was clean and had an attendant. Make sure to bring some singles to the restroom with you.",0
1792,"Cute tea shop with breakfast and lunch. It is a bit hidden, and when you enter the eating area is hidden behind a curtain for warmth, but it also gave a nice element of surprise. The restaurant gives an Alice in wonderland vibe. It's great for children or for adults. Tried the Alice's Tea which was nice and sweet with our even adding honey. Lucky to taste this tea just for checking in on the app.Presentation of food was very nice. Food is your typical breakfast, it's not exceptional. My review is for the location. Wasn't a fan of the buttermilk scone, it was so dry I had to immediately put water in my mouth to soak it up and be able to swallow. We sat upstairs and I think those are the best seats by the window.",0
3351,"I came here since I had a deal on the Your Local app for a free meal and was heading to a nearby workout later that night.  Ordering through the app was easy and pick up was smooth.  I got the salmon supreme which included 3 different types of salmon sushi rolls with a side of edamame and kelp.  Overall it was average.  The kelp was surprisingly not salty (good for those sensitive to salt, but not me), but that was fixed with a bit of soy sauce.  Edamame was pre-shelled and standard.  The salmon was fresh, but not as rich or flavorful as other salmon that I've had.  Rice was average in terms of taste and softness.  The big draw to this place would be the service, speed and ambiance over the food.  The seating area had a relaxing open feel and was bar style with a few areas that could be utilized as a group table or single seating.  Hooks were below table tops which was convenient for bags and jackets.  Some tea light candles were scattered about to add to the atmosphere.  Napkins, chopsticks and soy sauce were nearby all seats.  I'd return here (especially with a Your Local deal or after 9 when all prepackaged items are 1/2 off) for a quick sushi fix if I'm in the area again.",0

The eggs Benedict here are very filling and extremely rich. You will literally be in a food coma after. The butternut squash quinoa salad is also to die for. The quinoa is so crunchy you can hear every bite of salad. The butternut squash adds a nice sweet savory flavor to the dish. Even though it's all vegetables, this dish is incredibly filling and satisfying. Highly recommend if you're looking for something on the healthier side. Mimosas here a great, too!",0
12026,"An unassuming sushi restaurant with impeccable service, friendly staff, and a clean restaurant.This place doesn't have the ""wow"" factor when it comes to ambiance, and it doesn't have the pomp and circumstance of so many trendy Japanese spots in the city- i.e. Nobu, Mr. Chow, Tao. However, its simplicity and quality is refreshing. It's not trying to be a sceney spot where tourists flock, and I appreciate that.Upon arrival, I was greeted by the host and complimentary coat check, where they proceeded to escort me upstairs to my reserved table.

19019,"Title: A Hidden Gem with Room for Polish

After an unexpected change of plans during Chinese New Year, my friend and I stumbled upon this quaint dumpling haven nestled in the heart of Chinatown. Despite being slightly pricier than the humblest of competitors, the cost is justified: at $4 for 8 dumplings and $8-10 for a hearty bowl of noodles, it's a steal.

The food, without a doubt, is worth the buzz. Opting for both boiled and fried dumplings, we discovered the latter to be a culinary delight — a perfect blend of steamed tenderness with a delightful char. The skins were exquisitely delicate, though the meat filling could do with a touch more vigor.

Sauce aficionados will revel in the selection, especially the presence of chili oil, a rare find but a personal favorite. The basic sliced beef noodle dish impressed us, with the hand-pulled noodles stealing the show in texture and taste, making a mental note to try the hand-cut variety next time.

However, the service left us conflicted. Our perceived eagerness of the staff to see us out dampened the experience, particularly when they prematurely presented the bill. Additionally, although the wine was reasonably priced, a clearer itemization on the receipt would have been appreciated.

Despite the minor hiccups in service and a rather daunting bathroom situation typical of many Chinatown establishments, the food’s allure is undeniable. I’m looking forward to a return visit — the proximity to the courthouses makes it an appealing lunch destination for my workdays.",1
19855,"Title: A Gem in the Village - 232 Bleecker Shines!

Having always been a fan of Untitled at the Whitney, I was thrilled to experience Chef Suzy Cupps' new culinary adventure, and 232 Bleecker did not disappoint. From the warm reception at the door to the attentive service throughout the meal, the hospitality at this spot is top-notch, which is a priority for someone who values the dining experience as much as the food itself.

The menu's variety, particularly the vegetarian options, pleased my palate. My companions and I shared a delightful beet & lentil salad, savory brussels with pecans, and an outstanding chicken liver mousse paired with SheWolf bread – simply divine. The porchetta was succulent, and the kale lasagne was a comforting delight. Portions were generous, leaving us content without feeling overstuffed.

An added bonus was the well-curated and reasonably priced wine selection, a thoughtful consolation for the beer and wine-only license due to proximity to a neighboring church. This did not detract from the experience, however, as the choices complemented our meal beautifully.

232 Bleecker is a welcome addition to the Village, combining great food with an inviting atmosphere. I'm eagerly anticipating my next visit!",1
1647,"At the heart of my recent dining experience lies the question: Why must comfort food, simple in essence, command a premium price tag? While the Mac Lobsta did whet my appetite at $11 for a small portion, its size was more reminiscent of an appetizer than a fulfilling lunch. Patrons with a hearty appetite take heed—you may need to double your order or opt for a large to satiate your hunger. Despite this, I must commend the generous allocation of succulent lobster chunks within the dish. Though my personal preference yearns for a creamier, more indulgent cheese blend, the flavors were spot-on. All in all, the dish is a tantalizing tease for the taste buds but may leave your stomach longing for more.",1
15961,"I recently had the pleasure of dining at this renowned spot, eager to sample their award-winning Bone Marrow Wagyu Beef Brisket Ramen. And, oh, it lived up to the hype. The aroma of the rich, savory bone marrow and beef broth was tantalizing, promising a delightful experience even before the first bite. And that first taste? Pure bliss. The brisket was tender, the ramen perfectly cooked, and the garlic chips added a satisfying crunch that made each mouthful a moment to savor. Paired with half-priced hot sake, the hearty flavors were beautifully balanced, creating a symphony of taste that will linger in memory.

Don't miss the shishito peppers from the happy hour menu—an absolute steal for $3. Accommodating staff only enhanced the dining experience, ensuring I'll be back for more. Pro tip: enjoy your ramen hot, it's unbeatable that way.",1
285,"This place serves pretty decent Korean food at a good value. My party arrived at 6 on a Thursday night and it was about half full. Service was exceptional - the owner very nice and made sure we had everything we needed. In terms of food, we ordered a combo special (came with your choice of meat and a tofu soup) and a steamed egg each. The steamed egg was made in a hot stone bowl and it was amazing!! Definitely worth trying if you've never had it before. The tofu soup came out still sizzling hot and was amazing - very well seasoned and had lots of ingredients. For the main entrees, we ordered the chicken teriyaki, LA galbi, and bulgogi. The LA galbi was pretty good - definitely the best meat item at all Korean bbq places. The chicken teriyaki was pretty standard - as you can get at any other place. Their bulgogi was pretty good as well! For all the food we got, it was definitely a great value! Our entire table was covered with dishes and it was enough food to feed us and more. I would recommend this restaurant if you're looking for good Korean food on a budget.",0
18138,"Aahar Indian Cuisine is one of our favorite Indian restaurants in Manhattan, even though we've only had their food via delivery. The dishes are consistently delicious and good quality. My go-to order is the squash kofta, which consists of large squash dumpling balls in a delicious, slightly sweet creamy tomato sauce. The dumplings are heartily sized and the sauce is so rich that I usually split one entree into two meals. You don't see squash kofta as ubiquitously on Indian menus as other classics like palak paneer and aloo gobi, so the fact that Aahar offers this dish and cooks it so superbly is a primary factor in my loyalty.Besides the squash kofta, we love the chicken pista korma, which also includes a thick sauce with pistachio and cardamom. The combination of sweet, mildly spicy, savory is sublime here, as it is with the squash korma. The fresh naan is perfect for soaking up the sauces for both dishes.",0

The sriracha fries- bring on the heat! I loved them. Spicy spicy spicy. With the added jalapeño was a bit much but we devoured them!

19656,"Title: A Delightful Experience at The Bar Room

My long-awaited visit to The Bar Room, the laid-back sibling of the esteemed two-Michelin-starred The Modern, did not disappoint. Securing a reservation was a breeze and set the stage for a memorable dining experience.

Opting for the three-course pre-fixe dinner, the appetizers were the undisputed stars of the evening. The charred avocado, enhanced with a smoky flair and paired with fresh peekytoe crab, was a revelatory dish that everyone must try. Similarly, the morel mushroom fricassée with creamy white polenta delighted the palate, although the grilled romaine could have been reimagined or chopped for better integration.

For the entrees, the saddle of lamb was succulent, complemented perfectly by the ricotta agnolotti and spring onions. The crusted beef tenderloin I had was a triumph of flavors, cooked to a perfect medium-rare, leaving me wanting more.

Our dessert course was generously supplemented with an extra treat from the house. The cheese selection was a standout, featuring an array of choices including brie and a medium goat cheese. The rhubarb and jasmine rice pudding was refreshingly light, and the rum custard with its hints of lemongrass, coconut, and pineapple was an unforgettable finish.

The only hiccup was a slight delay between courses; however, the gesture of complimentary desserts smoothed over the wait. While it made for a longer evening than anticipated, especially with a babysitter on the clock, the quality of the food and the overall experience have us eager to return. Despite the pause in service, The Bar Room merits a high recommendation.",1
12678,"Title: A Tale of Two Kyclades: A Love Letter to Greek Cuisine

As a local Astorian, Kyclades has become a staple in my dining repertoire, and it's a tradition shared with my good friend Nadia whenever I'm in the city. While the city location boasts a more upscale ambiance, both venues share the challenge of securing a table – a testament to their popularity, yet they're worth every moment of anticipation.

The true star here is the seafood, offering the freshness you'd expect on a Grecian isle. Do your palate a favor and begin with their beet salad, where the feta cheese is nothing short of a dairy revelation. The Greek salad is another excellent starter, setting the stage for a culinary odyssey.

The menu favorites that demand a return visit include the KIDONIA GEMISTA and PSITA – stuffed clams and grilled calamari, respectively – both a celebration of the sea. The OKTAPODI, with its tender tendrils, leaves an imprint of flavor, while the SKORDALIA provides a garlicky mash of comfort. Don’t overlook the SAGANAKI, a sizzling pan-fried Greek cheese that's pure indulgence.

Moving to entrees, the BRANZINO and lamb chops embody rustic Greek cooking at its finest, while the BAKALIARAKIA – available grilled or fried – is a nod to simple, yet perfectly executed traditional fare.

In short, Kyclades stands as a beacon of authentic Greek/Mediterranean food, whether you find yourself in Astoria or the city. It's a spot that not only feeds the stomach but also the soul.",1

I recently visited The Casbah, a halal food cart on the Upper West Side, in the company of none other than Omar Sharif. While I found the meal pleasing, Sharif was far less impressed, expressing his discontent rather dramatically by punching the cart itself, causing it to sway precariously.

Despite its reputation and glowing reviews, The Casbah fell short of expectations. It's not the crown jewel of New York City's halal food scene, but it does offer a decent enough meal, especially when late-night options are scarce in the neighborhood. In a city with varying degrees of halal cuisine quality, The Casbah stands out as a solid choice without having to venture into Midtown.",1
12418,"Title: Fun Vibes and Delicious Tapas at Barn Joo

I recently dined at Barn Joo and was charmed by its ambiance and vibes. Although it was my first visit to their spacious location that welcomes reservations, it certainly won't be my last. Upon arriving, I had the delightful opportunity to spin a wheel for making a reservation and won a free glass of house wine – a whimsical touch I appreciated.

Our party of four was comfortably seated upstairs where the tables are well-spaced, offering privacy and the option for Korean BBQ. We indulged in a variety of tapas, including beef and veggie dumplings, truffle fries, an 8-piece tiger roll, soy wings, popcorn chicken, and a side of kimchi. The portions were perfect, satisfying without overfilling us before our main course of tacos – pork, fish, and shrimp, all of which were exceptional.

The food at Barn Joo deserves a solid 4 out of 5. The service, however, was a bit less consistent, meriting a 3. While our waiter was friendly, he seemed stretched thin attending to large parties, leading to some miscommunication. Still, the turnover of food was impressively quick.

Despite a couple of service hiccups, the overall experience was very enjoyable. I'm already looking forward to my next visit to Barn Joo for another round of delicious tapas and maybe another lucky spin!",1
10239,"Title: A Fusion Delight at Dominican Sushi Haven

My recent visit to an eclectic dining spot was nothing short of remarkable. This unique eatery masterfully merges the flavors of Dominican cuisine with the finesse of sushi, creating a sensory delight that's hard to forget. The star of the show? Without a doubt, their Dominican fusion sushi. Each bite is enhanced by the unexpected yet delightful taste of platano, which adds a wonderful kick to the already delectable rolls. 

The restaurant doesn't just excel in their sushi game; their beer selection and miso soup are on point, completing the dining experience. It's a rare gem where even the sauces accompanying the sushi stand out for their flavor. The service matched the quality of the food, with our server being both exceptionally kind and a surprisingly skilled photographer.

In conclusion, if you're after some of the best sushi with a twist and a place where the atmosphere is as inviting as the food, then this is your spot. Definitely worth recommending for anyone looking to indulge in a memorable meal.",1
24,"Title: UWS Brunch Gem with Bottomless Mimosas

Despite not being a local, I ventured to the Upper West Side on the allure of $10 bottomless mimosas and the promise of an excellent brunch. And indeed, the experience did not disappoint. The highlight of my visit was the selection of artisanal sausages: the buffalo & chipotle chili and the rabbit & white wine, each bursting with unique and distinct flavors. Paired with perfectly cooked over-easy eggs and hearty country potatoes, the meal was nothing short of delicious. Bottom line: I'm thoroughly impressed and already planning my next visit. Highly recommended for any brunch enthusiast!",1
3507,"Venturing into the world of arepas for the first time at this cozy spot turned out to be a delightful experience. The staff was notably friendly and proficient; the guy at the register commendably guided me through my indecision, suggesting the De Pabellon arepa, a solid choice for a newbie like me.

The ambience of the restaurant was pleasant, with a snug table set near the entrance offering comfort without feeling cramped despite the modest interior space. The arepa itself was a tasty introduction to the cuisine, presenting a well-balanced flavor profile with the cotija cheese adding a welcome hint of saltiness. The accompanying sauces were the stars for me, perfectly complementing and elevating each bite.

However, be ready for a bit of a mess as it tends to fall apart, especially with the sauce. Next time, I intend to keep it simple: grab the arepa wrapped in the provided wax paper, a little sauce on the side, and enjoy it on the go. Overall, it was a satisfying first foray into arepa dining, and I'm intrigued enough to return for more.",1
15156,"My dining experience at this venue on a Sunday afternoon started with a somewhat reasonable 30-minute wait for a table at 1:00 pm. Although the service was efficient, it lacked a personal touch, with staff bustling around hurriedly minus the warmth of eye contact or enthusiasm.

The Egg Benedict was a savory highlight from the brunch menu, offering a satisfying portion size. The standout dish for me was the biscuit with gravy—absolutely delicious and deserving of praise. Unfortunately, the southern style veggies fell short of expectations, being overly salted and disappointingly monotonous with a composition of mainly potatoes. I was hoping for a more diverse mix of vegetables and was left feeling let down by this dish.",1
14876,"My boyfriend and I live around the corner and have been wanting to come for a while. From the outside it looks super trendy and fun, always signs for happy hours. We finally came for dinner (on a Tuesday) and it was a lot bigger than I would have guessed. It was also packed for a Tuesday! We made a reservation but there were a lot of tables so I couldn't imagine the wait being too long. Ambiance was fun.The food and drinks were great! We ordered the strawberry and jalapeño margaritas and guacamole to start. I LOVED my chicken enchiladas and my boyfriend liked his carnitas dish. The sweet plantains on the side were delicious too! For dessert we got the doughnuts to-go since we were so full but really wanted to try them...YUM!Service was fine - nothing outstanding but nothing bad either so no comments there. Our waitress was friendly and orders came out relatively quickly which was nice.I think it is a little pricey for what you get. The food is very good but $15 for a guacamole appetizer and $15 for a small margarita glass. I feel like they should be priced a little lower. It is too bad you can't get the HH prices when you are in the sit-down section even if you are there during HH.Solid Mexican spot in the UES. Brunch sounds like it can get a little wild but dinner was a great experience and we will definitely come back!",0
15809,"The village strikes again with another gem! Clay pot is a dose of freshness and flavor that can only be described as Chinese comfort food. It is a small and cozy place with friendly staff. I enjoyed the salt and pepper wings and the shrimp, chicken and salmon pot. Sooooooo good! Plus a nice glass of sparkling wine to top it all off. I know the village has a lot of options, but if you want well made, fresh and delicious food with authenticity this is your place.",0
19948,"Small cozy thai place! The price is reasonable and the portions are just about right. If you are craving some asian foods, I recommend to try this place. We had cheese crab rangoon (very tasty and fillong), shrimp dumpling (strongly recommended) and the spicy basil udon (i wish their spicy is little more spicer!)",0

15457,"Tucked away near the buzz of Times Square and Broadway, this casual eatery is a haven for taco enthusiasts seeking both convenience and affordability. Despite the common queue, service is brisk, ensuring a short wait time. At roughly $4 per taco, patrons enjoy a personalized experience; after ordering, you'll hand your receipt to a chef who'll custom-craft your taco with a choice of tortilla, fresh toppings like avocado and salsa, among others. The standout here has to be the pork – impeccably juicy and packed with flavor. Whether you're looking for a quick snack or a full meal, these tacos hit the spot with their perfect portion size.",1
16560,"After eagerly anticipating a visit, I finally crossed this restaurant off my list. Arriving with two friends at 5 pm, the place was already bustling. Despite a brief wait and a sudden rush of patrons from the patio due to rain, we were seated relatively quickly. The complimentary cornbread was a delightful start, striking the perfect balance of sweetness – so much so that I requested seconds.

Our orders included the Smothered Chicken entree, accompanied by baked mac & cheese and pickled beets, as well as Fried Chicken and a side of ribs with mac & cheese and mashed potatoes. All dishes were quite delectable, and the portions so generous that we needed to-go boxes.

The bright spots of the experience were the amazing food, the quick service despite the crowd, the clean and welcoming ambiance, the availability of patio seating, WiFi, and the convenience of a 2-minute walk from the bus stop with a dedicated kitchen dining area for solo diners. On the downside, I found our server to lack attentiveness, and the restrooms could have been maintained better.

In summary, the restaurant truly is a gem with fantastic culinary offerings but has room for improvement in service and facility cleanliness.",1
3353,"Another Indian buffet I wholeheartedly give five stars to without being able to name a single thing I ate. Three of us came just as they were opening (actually a tiny bit earlier) this past week for their lunch buffet. I got the mango lassi at the recommendation of my coworker. Basically a delicious mango smoothie. It was very yogurty, sweet and thick. I probably wouldn't get it again because it was so heavy, but my friend said he likes to get it when he is eating spicy food.  As for the buffet, there's only about 8 or so trays, but everything was fantastic. I know it is the most basic and beginner of all the Indian foods, but the chicken tikka masala was incredible. So buttery and flavorful and sweet. I had to stop myself from getting a second plate of just that. Just like the other Indian buffets I've been to, the waiters come to your table with certain sides aside from the trays. This one was an amazing chicken leg. I'm not a fan of spice, and this was a bit spicy, but I still ate every bit of it. The naan was buttery and hot and so good to dip in the sauces. They put a plate of deep fried baby corn on the table as well that was new to me, but obviously incredible (big surprise).  Can't wait to come back.",0
15343,"Title: Delightful Group Lunch at Fusion Eatery

My colleagues and I, a party of approximately 20, decided to try this restaurant for a lunch outing, and it was a decision well-made. To ease the ordering process, we submitted our meal requests the day prior, which streamlined our dining experience beautifully. Contrary to expectations, the restaurant wasn’t overly crowded at peak lunchtime, and the service we received was both attentive and prompt.

The standout aspect was the unanimous satisfaction with the cuisine among all of us. I ventured into new culinary territory with the bulgogi burrito, a Korean take on the Mexican staple. It was scrumptious, with just the right portion size, and came accompanied by a side of fries. This place has earned my recommendation, and I eagerly anticipate our next visit.",1
139,"I recently visited a charming little eatery that truly understands the art of sandwich-making. Their offerings are a celebration of simplicity done extraordinarily well. Each sandwich boasted perfectly melted cheese hugged by toast generously slathered with butter, and served piping hot. It's a delightful reminder of how precious the simple pleasures in life can be when crafted with care.

While they offered some flexibility with sandwich ingredients, it's worth noting that the Mac & Cheese was less accommodating to substitutions—likely due to batch preparation. However, gluten-free options are thoughtfully provided for both sandwiches and Mac & Cheese, catering to diverse dietary needs.

The drink selection was pleasantly varied, with a good mix of soft and other beverages to wash down your meal. This spot has quickly become my go-to for comfort food that satisfies without the usual guilt—definitely a step above your standard pizza night. Can't wait for my next visit!",1
14673,"I absolutely love this gem of a place for dim sum! With both excellent quality and prices, it's hard to beat. Their 50% off deal on dim sum from 3-5 pm is a steal. My Saturday afternoon visit at 2:30 pm was a breeze with immediate seating. The shrimp dumplings, pork and thousand-year egg congee, and steam pork ribs were all top-notch, a solid 5/5. The pork taro and cilantro dumpling didn't quite hit the mark for me, garnering a 3/5, but the egg yolk buns were delightful with a 4/5 rating. Plus, they offer a 20% discount on all dim sum items as a promotion for being the new kid on the block. If you're in the mood for some delectable dim sum and don't fancy the long wait at Tim Ho Wan, this is your go-to spot.",1
18413,"This bar remains a highlight every time I'm in the vicinity. An unforgettable first impression was made when their talented female chef emerged to express gratitude for our food compliments. The standard was set high from that moment, and they've consistently delivered exceptional food, drinks, and service. The vibe during happy hour is relaxed, and their brunch is not to be missed. Although seating can be limited due to the cozy space, it adds to the ambiance. Don't leave without trying the nachos – highly recommended!",1
11800,"What a special experience. Wanted to take my good friend out to dinner for his birthday and was recommended to this spot by someone I know from Uptown. It was just 3 of us on a Sunday evening. We were promptly seated outside on a nice sunny July evening. When I tell you this was the best service I ever received. This guy went above and beyond and I wish I could remember his name. Very personable, accommodating and made dinner even more enjoyable than it already was.We were told the portion sizes were huge and they told no lies. Started the table with garlic bread which was amazing with a crispy crunch. Watch yourself though, gotta save room for the main course. Me and my friend who has a huge appetite split the special for the day which included multiple pastas. Each bite got better and better. And at the end we still had plenty of leftovers. Never have I seen so much good food all served on one plate. The birthday boy who is vegan got a vegetable pasta that I also got a taste of. Delicious vodka sauce. The server brought out an entire separate vegan menu that was much appreciated!At the end they brought out a small dessert with candles and sang happy birthday to my homie. 10/10 highly recommend. No complaints here. This place possesses the versatility to make it suitable for any occasion. Oh one more thing, they got huge drinks! Just one will give you a nice buzz!",0
1827,"I came here at 6 pm on a Friday evening. The place was lively but not overly crowded and we were seated right away.It was still happy hour so that was good! I had the lavender Collins cocktail and I think it's lovely if you are into lavender as a flavor. Besides the lavender syrup, fresh lavender was sprinkled into the drink too, which I felt was a nice flourish.We had the guacamole and chips which I think was okay but also forgettable and I don't recommend it especially. I think I would have liked it with more flavor like lime or more vegetables mixed in or more of a spicy kick. The chips were nice though in terms of the crunchiness and they were fresh. They also gave pico de gallo, but again that was too bland (needed jalapeño). We had the fried chili shrimp which was amazing. It was spicy, breaded, sweet, thickly coated. Many flavors seemed to blend together in a harmonious way. The cheese balls were amazing. I highly recommend them. They were very filling too. I even packed two of them. They were coated in a creamy sauce (the sauce was to die for and we used it as dip for the chips). They had a unique flavor combination and at one point I even felt there was a sprinkle of orange flavor to it, which was quite nuanced and delicate. It was also a surprising twist. Based on the creaminess of the cheese balls, I would love to come back for the kimchi pasta!",0
18537,"Empellon Taqueria is one of three creative Mexican restaurants by chef/owner Alex Stupak. Stupak is actually a pastry chef (Alinea and wd-50), so his approach is a bit unique. Always creative and always flavorful. The hallmark at all his restaurants are great tequila/mezcal-based cocktails, amazing quesos and unique tacos. The pastrami tacos alone are worth the trip to the West Village. The colorful atmosphere adds to the experience.",0
1799,"My go to restaurant for udon. Their udon is literally perfect and the texture is the right amount of chewiness. Came with a party of four on a Wednesday evening and had to wait around 45 min. I ordered the curry chicken udon which came out pretty fast. The soup was piping hot and flavorful and came with onions, spinach and chicken. Service was attentive and the interior has a nice aesthetic. They serve you frozen grapes at the end, except the ones we received were defrosting and soggy.",0
326,"China Blue offers an ideal setting for friends keen on sharing a variety of dishes, although the varying quality across the menu means it's best to choose wisely. Our table particularly enjoyed the garlic pickles, which outshone the vast array of pork dishes we sampled. Despite the impressive pork selection, including soup dumplings, pan fried buns, and Beijing style pancakes, few stood out enough to warrant a repeat order.

The fish fillets in a unique sauce were a highlight, hinting that exploring beyond pork may be worthwhile. On a less positive note, the restaurant's signage is obscured when the door is open, causing some confusion upon arrival. Additionally, the discrepancy between the advertised premium bourbon and the well bourbon actually served in a $15 cocktail was disappointing. China Blue serves as a reminder that while variety is the spice of life, not all spices are created equal.",1

19498,"Title: A Midtown Gem: Culinary Delight Meets Serenity

I recently discovered a tranquil oasis amid Midtown's bustle, where the dining experience transcends the ordinary. Our 7pm arrival on a bustling Saturday revealed a jovial atmosphere, complemented by an exquisite wine selection that promised a memorable evening.

The service shone from start to finish, a seamless orchestration that elevated our night. The culinary journey commenced with succulent fried calamari and the ingenious pairing of prosciutto-wrapped burrata. The mains—a decadent seafood risotto and a veal scallopine bathed in a rich mushroom marsala—were crafted to perfection. Even the complimentary bread, olives, and oil felt like a thoughtful prelude to the feast that followed.

It's not just the flavors that will beckon us back but the ambiance, a harmonious blend of warmth and refinement. Gratitude to Chef Paolo for creating an experience that leaves diners yearning for their next visit. A return to this serene enclave is not a matter of if, but when. Grazie mille, indeed.",1

14044,"Title: Taboonette: A Mediterranean Delight!

As a response to my Mediterranean cravings, I turned to Yelp and stumbled upon Taboonette. I eagerly ordered the Israeli breakfast on pita for $6.50, anticipating a modest serving but craving extra protein, I added a side of tender, perfectly shredded pulled pork for $5, and a zesty side of Shugg, a spicy pepper sauce, for just $2.

My order arrived at lightning speed, a delightful surprise. The pita was an absolute winner: crunchy, packed with flavor, and free from the sogginess that often plagues such dishes. The pulled pork complemented the meal with its tender texture, and the Shugg provided a necessary kick of acidity that made each bite an experience to remember.

Thanks to Yelp, Taboonette is no longer a hidden gem for me. Its combination of flavor, affordability, and quick service guarantees it's now on my weekly dining roster. Highly recommended for anyone in search of an authentic, satisfying Mediterranean meal!",1
17779,"The Cali salad was good! I enjoyed all the ingredients except for goat cheese but couldn't find a way to exclude it in the Ritual ordering app. I wish the chicken weren't so dry though.

We also had the jamon supplement. It was outrageous.The cheese course was amazing and a wonderful conclusion to the meal. Dessert was also outstanding.The wines were also amazing. We had champaign that started off like typical champaign but the finish was more like a glass of burgundy. Totally delicious.  The space is beautiful and open.

1387,"I recently dined at a highly recommended restaurant, excited to try it after my sister's glowing reviews. My experience was overwhelmingly positive, although I must note that lunch options were somewhat limited, earning the restaurant 4 stars from me. Patrons should also be aware that lunchtime payments are cash only.

I opted for the salmon teriyaki salad bowl, accompanied by a piping hot miso soup that did not disappoint. The salmon itself was a highlight — tender, crispy, and exquisitely buttery, perfectly complemented by a zesty wasabi dressing that really brought the salad to life. A shrimp side salad with celery was included, which, while tasty, was unfortunately a bit wilted.

Despite this minor hiccup, the quality of the main dish convinces me to return, next time aiming to explore the dinner offerings.",1
10624,"Title: Delightful Service with a Side of Confusion

I recently dined at a charming restaurant where the service shone as the highlight of my experience. The waitstaff were exceptionally friendly and accommodating, which set a pleasant tone for the meal.

For my entrée, I selected the classic meatballs and was not disappointed. They were flavorful and well-prepared, a true testament to the kitchen's capabilities. My husband's choice of veggie meatballs, despite containing butternut squash and sweet potato (not my favorites), took me by surprise with their deliciousness, and his sides of mashed potatoes and roasted garlic were equally commendable.

Unfortunately, the meal hit a snag when my Big Italian salad arrived. It was missing several advertised ingredients such as pepperoni and artichokes, or they were chopped so finely they were nearly undetectable amidst the unexpected addition of parmesan cheese, which was not mentioned on the menu. After questioning the server, it appeared some ingredients were indeed present but not as prominent as I had expected. A posted picture online elicited varied opinions from viewers about the invisibility of said ingredients.

However, a delightful pro tip for future visitors: grab a window seat for a serene dog-watching session, a stark and welcome contrast to the bustling crowds of Times Square.

Update as of 3/12/2020: Post-visit, the manager Ryan reached out and clarified the salad's contents, naming pepperoncini and grana cheese as menu-listed ingredients, shattering my initial confusion. His attentive response and dedication to customer satisfaction have prompted me to revise my review favorably. Other restaurants should take note of such exemplary service.",1

If you've ever had Filipino food, you'll know it essentially falls into a few food groups: pork, rice, and fried. Jeepney is no different but they do it well. We had the lumpiang shanghai and happy hour crispy chicken skins for starters. Both were very enjoyable and delicious. For entrees, we shared the sisig tacos and pork bicole express with garlic rice. Again, just plain delicious. The only thing that I found a bit off was the fact that we were asked if we had reservations twice and greeted twice by two different people. It seemed a bit disorganized to me. That said, place is affordable, delicious, and an overall good time.",0
12702,"Title: Mixed Feelings On Birthday Celebration at [Restaurant Name]

Last night I celebrated my birthday at [Restaurant Name] with a group of 14 friends, indulging in a three-course prix fixe dinner with a couple of drinks each. The turkey meatballs and calamari were delightful, and my steak entree was both well-prepared and aesthetically pleasing, although just okay in taste. 

Unfortunately, the consensus within our group was that the drinks didn't hit the mark. Additionally, the portion sizes left something to be desired, as we found ourselves seeking more food elsewhere after our meal.

A significant hiccup occurred with our reservation. Initially booked for 20, only 14 of us dined, yet we were charged for the full party. Our exceptional waiter, Jose, promptly addressed this with the manager, Jade. However, Jade's insistence on charging us for no-shows, citing a policy that was miscommunicated via email, left us frustrated. Despite this, kudos to Jose for his remarkable service; he was a highlight in our evening.

The ambiance at [Restaurant Name] is certainly beautiful, but the billing issue cast a shadow over the experience. Future diners should be wary of the reservation policies and speak with staff like Jose to ensure clarity. Regrettably, this experience has deterred me from returning, despite the initial appeal of the restaurant.",1
11791,"I recently dined at this charming restaurant and found it to be a delightful experience overall. The highlights of my meal were the appetizers, with the veggie dumplings and scallion pancakes standing out for their flavor and quality. Although I was slightly less impressed with my entrée, the eggplant in garlic sauce—the dish was a tad too oily for my taste—the sauce itself was exceptional, rich, and flavorful, served with a healthy serving of brown rice.

One area that could use improvement is the service. While friendly, it lacked efficiency, particularly when it came to getting our bill, which took longer than expected. Despite this hiccup, the restaurant's ambiance is undeniably sweet and inviting, and the food is generally delicious. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for good eats in a cozy setting.",1
10008,"I had this for take out. ordered via Yelp and pick it up for lunch. had the Pad Thai lunch special with Po Pia Thod (Fried Spring Roll) as the appetizer of choice. I was happy of how convenient the ordering process was and food was ready to be picked up on time. Service seemed great too as the waiter was friendly, attentive, and helpful when I came to pick up mine. So we were on for a great start. But I was so disappointed with the food. The spring roll was not bad, but does not particularly stand out. Taste like a tasty spring roll from supermarket / random deli instead of authentic Thai restaurant if you get what I mean. As in it's not bad but you would expect something more from a Thai restaurant. The pad thai though was just bland. I mean it was perhaps the most bland pad thai I've ever had. Noodle texture was somewhere between mushy and sticky too. I finished the whole thing anyway but I will highly doubt to come back :( I'm so sad to hve to give such review because I really like the vibe at first",0
10395,"Stopped by for a year-end lunch and I had a great experience here.My date hadn't told me that she's taking me here so I was wearing ski sweater so the valet guys gave me a black jacket to change to. I had to give her a look, haha. So GENTS - WEAR YOUR SUIT JACKET. You could get away with nice knit sweaters, button-down shirts or anything considered formal though. The ambiance was classy though it's not the chic/modern many may be accustomed to. It's dim lantern lighting, a fresh vase of flowers type of place. I was impressed that they had warming tables where impeccably dressed waiters cutting up appetizers and deboning fish before bringing the food to the guests.Onto food, - Duo of Jumbo Lump Crab Meat and Chilled Oysters ($30, app): This was delectable. Extremely fresh, briny oysters came with real cocktail sauce and mustard-mayo both of which brought out the flavor without overpowering, and the crab meat was super fresh and tasty. Worth it.- Tenderloins of Beef, Potato Cake, Fried Onion Rings ($35, ent): Meat was cooked perfectly in beef jus and was so satisfying chewing. There was a piece of roasted sundried tomato that added so much flavor along the potato and crispy onion rings that I really felt every items of this dish worked together to create a wonderful flavor bonanza in my mouth! Well done! - Jumbo Lump Crab Cake with Grilled Corn ($28, ent): Normally opposed to crab cakes, my date just ate this up without any complaints! Not oily or overly bready, this was one of the best crab cakes I've had sans port-side crabcake joints in Boston. Laughed at the ""grilled corn"" (see below) though. - Lemon Tart with Raspeberries ($16, desrt): This was a great finish to the more ""creamy/fried"" dishes. Pastry was a bit hard so it broke as I cut it but tasty otherwise. I am not a frequent French diner so I might have been surprised more than regulars at their small portions. I literally laughed when I saw the ""onion rings"" on the beef which were literally two very thin fried onion rings. Even funnier was the ""grilled corn"" that came with the crab cakes because they were literally bits of corn kernels decorating 5 corners of this dish! (See pic) I'm not saying this to criticize, but for the diners, esp. American ones, to have the right expectations. That said, we were curiously full so it wasn't an issue. Also, having these small(er) portions made us appreciate every bite much more and see the thoughts put behind each dish by the chef. To be honest, that's the way food should be everywhere. Only in America ... (let me stop there, haha)Definitely not for a weekly dinner, but this place will deliver the total dining experience. Highly recommended!",0
2941,"Title: A Hidden Gem Attached to A Hotel

I recently dined at an adjoining restaurant within a hotel and was pleasantly surprised by the experience. Despite our lunchtime visit from 12:30 to 1:30 p.m. on a Thursday, the place was pretty empty, which made for a quiet and relaxed meal.

I opted for the bun-less mushroom sandwich - a healthier twist that did not disappoint, although a touch more feta and balsamic would have elevated it further. My client chose the TGA burger and was thoroughly impressed with its taste and quality. We both savored the sweet potato fries that accompanied our meals – they were a delightful addition that we thoroughly enjoyed.

The restaurant boasts a large bar area with ample seating, ideal for those who might be looking to unwind with a drink. The service was decent; given that there was only one bartender/server managing the floor, he did an admirable job attending to our needs.

For those in the vicinity, I'd recommend stopping by this cozy spot. It's well worth the visit for a casual yet satisfying dining experience.",1
3563,"Title: A Slice Above the Rest at Prince Street Pizza

If you find yourself wandering through SoHo with a pizza craving, Prince Street Pizza is a renowned spot you shouldn’t miss. Its fame was evident as my friends and I joined a manageable queue spurred on by the inviting aroma and the gallery of celebrity photos adorning the walls.

We sampled the margherita and cheese slices—undeniably a notch above the ubiquitous dollar slice joints. At around $4 per piece, the price reflects the quality: fresh, high-grade ingredients, a homemade touch, and a perfectly crisp crust that sings cheesy bliss.

Be warned, the cozy shop isn't built for dining in, and the popularity of the place means you'll likely rub elbows with a crowd. Our advice: take your slices to-go and perch on some nearby steps to enjoy your SoHo slice experience.

While I reserve the term ""must-try"" for the crème de la crème of New York's endless food scene, Prince Street Pizza stands out as a worthy visit for those in the area with time—and appetite—to spare.",1
14100,"Ordered Teriyaki Salmon for lunch- firstly i was disappointed by their package of food: the container was paper-made not very good in containing hot food and they all look like weird shapes and the juices were spilled out everywhere when delivered. For this, I would highly suggest the restaurant changes their food packages because it really doesnt look appetizing.As for the food itself, it doesnt impress me in anyway (maybe because I was first unimpressed by the appearance of food package when delivered). The ratio of glaze to salmon was a bit too much so it was really sweet and the salmon was also quite dry. The salad was pretty fresh though. The dumplings taste decent but because of the heat, it wasnt as crispy as it should be either.Overall, it's just an okay place.",0
16228,"Tucked away just blocks from the bustling St. Marks Place and a stone's throw from the popular Ippudo, this gem brings a slice of Japanese innovation to the heart of the city. The restaurant’s concept is brilliantly simple yet delightful – choose your preferred cut of steak (I had the robust ribeye while my friend opted for the leaner sirloin) and specify the weight to satisfy your appetite. They’ll cook it to your exact liking and serve it alongside two hearty sides. When it arrives, still sizzling on a hot plate, you're invited to add your choice of flavorful sauces and carve your perfect bite. The steak, though not aged, is succulent and a carnivore's dream. This spot is a must-visit for steak enthusiasts looking for a tailored experience in a personalized, no-frills manner.",1

As a Thai food enthusiast, I opted for the drunken noodles with shrimp served under the lunch special, paired with a salad. The dish was delicious and featured an innovative touch with fried kale on top, an enjoyable departure from the traditional version. A minor drawback was that the spice level wasn't customizable as they didn't inquire. Additionally, the fresh shrimp spring rolls with peanut dressing were a delight. Overall, a commendable spot for a Thai cuisine fix.",1

They cook everything at the bar and pretty much everyone who works there seem to be Italian (authenticity?).   Prices are not the most affordable, especially for the serving sizes. I'm not saying I've left hungry but a twenty plus dollar plate of pasta in only sauce could be more generous. Service is good, the food is better and the atmosphere is very welcoming so don't rush through your dish, relax and enjoy for a while, at least that's what I do :)",0
13005,"Tucked away in the West Village, with a second location in LIC, Corner Bistro serves up the quintessential New York ""dive bar burger"" experience that locals swear by. The Bistro Burger is a no-frills delight, elevating 8 ounces of juicy beef with classic American cheese and perfectly crispy bacon. Served unpretentiously on a paper plate, it's a comfort classic capable of turning any day around. And with a price tag of just $12.75, it offers an oasis of value in the city's pricey dining scene. Forget the extravagant toppings found elsewhere; the Bistro Burger sticks to what it knows best and excels because of it.",1
111,"Tucked away on the first floor of the Parker Hotel, NORMA'S serves up a breakfast experience that's hard to beat. The interior design and ambiance immediately set a welcoming tone, matched only by the friendliness of the staff.

My visit commenced with a well-prepared cappuccino, accompanied by a delightful complimentary smoothie shot—a nice touch. The main event was the traditional Eggs Benedict, which did not disappoint. The hollandaise sauce had a unique flavor that elevated the dish beyond the ordinary. On the side, the maple bacon was a standout, cooked to perfection with just the right balance of sweetness and crispness.

In summary, NORMA'S hits all the right notes for a top-notch breakfast. A definite must-visit for hotel guests and passersby alike.",1
18715,"I loved the decor of this place. The place had a happy hour running till 10pm on Saturday. The cosmo that the bartender served was the cheapest one on the menu that I ordered but I loved it! The bartender made them spot on and he made sure that it was done right every time he served it to me. I had to order like 5 more before the happy hour was up, it was that good! This place got very busy and the music was pumping after 10:30pm with the live DJ. It was great to have a large group meet up and they had lots of seating. Bottle service for parties as well. I will totally recommend people to come out and check this place out.",0
14498,"Title: A Brunch to Remember at on

I recently popped back into on for brunch, inspired by fond memories from a previous Yelp event. I'm thrilled to report that the quality hasn't waned in the slightest. The food continues to be outstanding, with every dish arriving cooked to sheer perfection. The server greeted us with open arms, enhancing an already delightful experience.

The standout for me and my companions was the shared induction truffle mushroom egg soufflé – a true fusion of flavors that you simply must try. However, the star of the menu remains the chicken dish with glass noodles. The juices and sauces are absorbed by the noodles creating a mouth-watering symphony of taste that I can’t praise enough.

If you haven't yet, make plans to visit on for brunch. It's an absolute must!",1
16013,"By Chloe offers a charming and convenient lunch spot that stands out for its ease of finding a seat in a busy area. As someone who typically doesn’t opt for vegan fare, I found the food to be satisfactory, but not a replacement for traditional offerings. The Mac had an unexpected spicy element that didn't quite align with my preference for classic Mac and cheese. While the air-fried fries were enjoyable, especially when dipped in aioli sauce, they tended to cool off rather quickly. The highlight of the meal was definitely the lemon scone – a delightful treat. In summary, the visit was decent, but I’m inclined to try different dishes on any potential return.",1
11757,"Title: A Thai Gem in the Heart of Flatiron – Thai Villa

After hearing countless praises and being tantalized by its presence on my Yelp feed, I finally embarked on my culinary journey to Thai Villa, a Thai gem nestled in the bustling Flatiron District. With the hype setting high expectations, the restaurant did not disappoint.

Opting for a Sunday lunch to avoid the notorious wait times (that can exceed an hour on no-reservation evenings), my colleague and I were seated immediately in the beautifully adorned space at opening time. The dreamy decor, with its lavish wooden features and golden accents, exuded elegance and invited admiration.

As a newcomer to Thai cuisine, the menu guidance provided by our server was much appreciated. The decision to delve into the ""privileged"" section of specialty entrees was a leap towards authenticity I was eager to take. We commenced with the Mieng Kum – deceptively simple lettuce cups that burst with complexity when tasted in unison, setting a high bar for what was to come.

My choice of Goong Ma Kham (shrimp with tamarind sauce) was an absolute triumph. The plate featured generously sized shrimp bathed in a beautifully balanced sauce that married well with the accompanying jasmine rice, each bite a testament to the harmonious blend of flavors Thai Villa so expertly achieves.

Service throughout our visit was impeccable, with a welcoming atmosphere and well-timed presentation of dishes.

In conclusion, Thai Villa stands as a beacon of Thai authenticity, capturing both the palate and the eye. It's a resounding yes from me, and I'm already looking forward to my next visit to further explore the culinary delights that Thai Villa has to offer.",1
2247,"Came here for dinner with friends for the holidays...been here before and recommended it. Yes, a bit on the pricier side for Italian food.  Great service and food. Décor of the restaurant is nice and the atmosphere.We had the burrata w/ prosciutto appetizert was delicious! one of the best that I have had. complimentary bread was good.Also ordered the salmon with roasted cauliflower - delicious as well. Ravioli di manzo (short ribs) - was okay...needed a little more flavor to it.Didn't get to have dessert this time but there were a couple of options may try another time.",0
10885,"I recently visited a local eatery renowned for its tacos, and I must say, the experience exceeded my expectations. The restaurant offers an impressive selection of gluten-free, vegetarian, and vegan options, catering to a variety of dietary needs without compromising on flavor.

The food is of outstanding quality, and what's more, it's offered at very reasonable prices. Each bite was a testament to the care and authenticity put into the cooking.

Service was another high point – attentive and friendly, making our dining experience smooth and enjoyable.

And for a quirky side note, you absolutely must check out the restroom – the wallpaper is unexpectedly cool. It’s not often you find a Yelp review praising bathroom decor, but this place deserves it!

Overall, a must-visit spot for taco lovers and those who appreciate thoughtful service and a bit of whimsy.",1
20406,"Although the line was pretty long it went quicker than I expected. I tried the cactus, pork and chicken taco. Without knowing what all they put into the taco, I opted for everything expect for cilantro. The pork taco had an EXTRA kick of spice so ask them to hold the spice if you can't take spicy foods like myself. The chicken taco had great flavor and was even better with a squeezed lime. I wasn't a big fan of the cactus taco, I'd rather stick to meat. I also ordered a Tamarindo juice which wasn't too sweet. Next time I'm looking forward to trying their beef taco. Seats are limited near Los Tacos, most people just stand around and it can get pretty congested. I would advice you to go downstairs to get a seat and avoid the crowd.",0
15691,"Wow. Just wow. Everything in this restaurant is amazing except the prices. It's on an expensive side. The service is excellent, food - literally every dish is great and decorative. And at the end, they give you a complimentary yogurt  dessert with rose water. Probably, one of the most delicious desserts I've ever had in NYC",0
15641,"I visited the restaurant for a team lunch on a Friday at 1 pm, and despite a reservation, the half-empty venue hinted at what was to come. The establishment is known and loved by some colleagues, but my experience was lackluster, possibly due to our large group of 13 impacting service and food quality.

The ambiance is very casual, with simple decor and a sizable bar appropriate for groups. Unfortunately, service fell short. Our waitress was kind but struggled to keep up with our demands, resulting in prolonged wait times and staggered food arrival. The bus boy also lacked finesse, contributing to a disorderly experience.

The food was underwhelming, with a limited American menu that didn't justify the high prices. The calamari and chickpea fritters were unexceptional, the deviled eggs and lamb meatballs were disappointing, and the salads were basic. The day's special, jumbo shrimp in sweet batter, was the meal's lone standout. My skirt steak was mediocre, especially compared to the much-praised burgers that my peers enjoyed. Sides like truffle fries were average, but the fingerling potatoes were a highlight.

Desserts were a mixed bag, with the French vanilla cheesecake falling flat, while the tiny cannolis and warm apple brown betty were pleasing. The flourless chocolate cake, as recommended by our waitress, was rich and balanced by the vanilla ice cream.

In conclusion, given the better options available in the area, I wouldn't return or recommend this restaurant.",1
18481,"Title: A Gem Beyond Chinatown – Excellent Dumpling House

Review:
In the realm of dim sum delights, Excellent Dumpling House stands as a culinary cornerstone that does more than justice to its bold moniker. My three-year patronage attests to the consistently sublime experiences that secure its spot as my preferred dim sum sanctuary outside Chinatown.

The menu's highlight is, without doubt, their Pork Soup Dumplings – a slightly pricier choice but one that rewards the palate with its delicate skin and flavorful, ginger-infused broth. It's an irresistible indulgence that calls for multiples when dining with friends.

Equally tempting are their Scallion Pancakes, striking the perfect balance between flakiness and crunch without succumbing to greasiness. At just $3.90, it's an affordable slice of heaven. Then there's the Chinese Broccoli, an embodiment of simplicity and freshness that's hard to come by in Manhattan, offering a generous portion that somewhat justifies the steep $14 tag.

Admittedly, prices tilt towards the higher end for takeout, and the narrow delivery radius is a quibble. Despite this, the allure of their heavenly spread beckons for dine-in experiences. While I waver between a 4-star and a 5-star rating, my frequent returns are a testament to its excellence. A broader delivery reach would seal the fifth star. For now, Excellent Dumpling House remains an esteemed 4-star haven for dim sum aficionados.",1
10771,"The short: good food, very kind service, but don't recommend coming on a hot summer day. The longer: this place is super tiny and charming. There are a bunch of very small tables pushed within inches of one another. It's crowded - it's clearly a popular spot (and they have a sister restaurant around the corner). We came on a weekday night for dinner. A bunch of people entered the restaurant right after us. It took us a bit to get menus and water. The water we received was warm. We asked for ice or cooler water. Even the bottled water we were going to pay for was lukewarm at best. They ended up bringing us cups of ice, which we appreciated. We had arancini and octopus appetizers to start, and then ordered a pasta dish to share. The middle of the arancini were cold (ironic given the struggle we'd had getting cold water). The octopus was very good. We shared the cavatelli. We appreciated that they split the dish in half for us, but the dish was average at best. I would absolutely not rush back here.",0
13653,Great casual lunch spot or quick dinner spot in midtown. Perfectly cooked Pork Tonkatsu. Crisp breading. Not greasy at all. Super tender pork cooked perfectly. Moist but not undercooked. There are two pork options. Berkshire Pork and regular pork. The Berkshire is thicker but both are delicious. Great service. It's almost always packed but they are super efficient. They get you your food very quickly but don't rush you to finish. Great timing. Even the rice and shredded lettuce are really good here!Great spot!,0
17412,"Absolutely deserving of a five-star rating, this pizzeria is a must-visit gem for anyone passing through the tri-state area. Stepping inside, you're immediately transported to a classic Italian eatery that exudes charm. Despite the line, it's efficient and completely worth the wait. I indulged in their classic Margherita pizza, and frankly, it's all I needed to be convinced that this place is truly special.",1
12223,"Visited Uncle Boone's on a Saturday night at 9:30 PM and were promptly seated at the bar. Despite generally disliking bar dining, the immediate seating was a plus. Unfortunately, the service was a letdown; one bartender was distractingly loud and another accidentally spilled beer on me, which was quite unpleasant.

However, the food redeemed the evening. The deep-fried pig ears with fish sauce were an absolute delight and stood out as the star of the night. The bone marrow paired with bread was decent, and while the crispy noodle salad with cauliflower was particularly enjoyed by my partner, I found it to be a pleasant mix of sour and sweet. The pig jowl curry, though, was lackluster and the most disappointing dish, offering an unremarkable taste and paling in comparison to the others.

To drink, the Baa Baa Bo Bo cocktail—a spicy Margarita with a chili sugar rim—was expertly crafted and thoroughly enjoyable. Despite the service hiccups, the standout dishes and exceptional cocktail made for an overall satisfying dining experience.",1
1839,"Title: Pre-Theater Delight at [Restaurant Name]

My pre-theater dining experience at [Restaurant Name] was nothing short of fantastic. The evening began elegantly with a round of wine and prosecco, setting a high note for what was to come. Fresh oysters and zesty ceviche followed, offering a refreshing start to the meal. The entrées raised the bar further; the spaghetti with calamari was a savory revelation, and the John Dory perched atop a bed of broccoli rabe was cooked to perfection. As expected, the desserts at [Restaurant Name] stole the show - the creamy panna cotta and tangy lemon meringue parfait were both memorable finales. Complementing the exemplary cuisine, the attentive staff ensured a seamless dining experience within the restaurant's visually charming decor. An evening well spent and highly recommended for pre-theater indulgence.",1
1912,"I agree with other reviewers who noted the meals here are expensive for the portion sizes you get. And if you get the 2 for $20 special, note that you get two half portions for $20 - not two whole meals. We had to ask the waitress for clarification several times to decipher this. Being hungry, we decided to order a la carte, each ordering separate full sized entrees - and the food was delicious. I had the fried fish (about $16) and my friend had seafood soup (real name of the dish, I cant recall). I was less than thrilled with my side order of steamed veggies (not pictured) with coconut but only because I didn't know what to expect and they were bland, except for the sweet potato.As for overall service, I was greeted and seated promptly. All questions regarding menu and pricing options were answered and we received our food in a reasonable amount of time. Portions are somewhat smallish, but I was satisfied.Seating is bench/ communal style and the vibe is very casual. On a Monday night around 7pm, there was no wait for seating. I could easily see going back to this restaurant.",0
18423,"How can you not like this place?! A cheap local bar & restaurant with outdoor space on the roof. Happy hour is until 7pm and they have food/drink deals Monday's through Wednesday. Monday night wings (4pm to 10pm) 1/2 price wings and tenders. $4 draft beer. Taco Tuesdays (4pm to 10pm) $2 off tacos, $5 frozen with taco purchase (taco original price ranges from $7 to $16 without the discount depending on whether you order 2 or 3 and what kind). Wednesday is burger night where you can get a free draft with a purchase of a burger. I like to come here for their frozen especially when the warmer weather hits so I can enjoy my margarita with a gf in the sun! Close to Columbia University and a local favorite spot!",0
14058,"The fish dumplings were very good. The veggie version was not as plump and tasted quite plain. Main dish: pig knuckles with red peppers were dry.Starters: spicy watery chicken was all right.

16942,"grabbed the chicken souvlaki pita for a quick lunch on the go. they were very quick in taking order and delivering the food, which was what I need. the taste was pretty on point too. succulent chicken, tasty yoghurt sauce, good consistency of pita bread - however the size was so tiny compared to the price that I have to be disappointed. if only they're bigger i'd definitely give higher points",0
13569,"After a busy afternoon by the pool and with a wedding preparation looming, we sought a swift bite at Antico Noe, nestled in the food court. Limited options at the time funneled us towards a salami panini, which, priced at around $12, tread closely to what you might expect to dish out in Midtown — not outrageous, yet not a steal either. The panini itself was generously laden with meat, though it was somewhat overshadowed by an excessively greasy exterior that dampened the overall experience.",1
13881,"Title: Delicious Brunch Marred by Lackluster Service - 3 Stars

I was tempted to award five stars after my brunch experience at this establishment, all thanks to the mouthwatering dishes, particularly the Malawach which still lingers in my memory hours later, and my husband's praise for the Moroccan Benedict. The decor inside caught my eye with its unique charm, setting a great scene for what I hoped would be a perfect dining experience.

However, the service dampened our enthusiasm. Our server’s inattentiveness was stark; we were left unattended throughout our meal, with only brief appearances for order-taking. Observing a neighboring patron's repeated and unfulfilled requests for a simple coffee refill and a tall chair for his child only solidified our disappointment.

In conclusion, while the food may beckon me back with its allure, it is with the hope that the service will rise to meet the standard set by the cuisine.",1
12804,"Stumbled upon this place last year just to enjoy drinks and haven't been back. Decided to try it again with a friend since one of our favorite places not too far was closed. I remember our first time trying damn near every margarita on the menu, lol. Took things a bit easy this time. One of my favorite cuisines is Mexican so any chance I get, I attempt to try it. The margaritas here are refreshing! If you're looking for an extreme buzz, this isn't the place lol. I prefer refreshing occasionally. Of course I had to grab my fave, cucumber jalapeño. It was tasty but not the best I ever had. The pear was very good. 10/10 recommend.Now to be honest I had low expectations for the food so we went with tacos. To our surprise...they were delicious. First time having fish tempura tacos and boyyyyy were they tasty. The Brussels sprouts one *inserts drool face* lol. Btw, we went for happy hour so the margaritas were $9 and the tacos were $5 each. $5 for a taco to me still isn't happy hour price but they were good. We sat at the bar service was very bar friendly no complaints there.",0
2770,"3.5 ratingSooo the waffles were really good. I'm talking love at first bite. It was so good that I didn't want to share with nobody! My waffle was buttery, cakey and had just the right amount of sugar. Then it was the chicken and that was just meh!Amy Ruth's is a soul food place located in the heart of Harlem. It's known for their many different pairings of waffle creations such as catfish and waffles, waffles and steak, waffles with fried shrimp, you name it they got it! I also love how the meals are named after great African Americans such as Al Sharpton, Gabrielle Union and Barack Obama. When we arrived around 12:30pm, I had my heart set on ordering an entree however we were told that the chef was still in the process of closing out his breakfast so I had to settle for the chicken and waffles on their breakfast menu.Once again their waffles- super yummy!! however the chicken was not great it wasn't bad but it wasn't standard soul food chicken. I was expecting the chicken to have the right amount of season and the crispity crunch instead I got plain basic fried chicken. Overall service was pretty fast, prices were reasonable and our waiter was friendly and personable!",0
16422,"Title: Great Value for Quick Eats

If you're on the hunt for a quick and hearty bite without breaking the bank, this no-frills pizza spot is your go-to. Remember to swing by the ATM first because this is a cash-only establishment. For a mere $4, you're treated to a generous slice of thin crust pizza that promises to satisfy your hunger. 

I sampled the Pepperoni and Mozzarella slices, which were decent, albeit not the best I've tasted. The trade-off, however, is the unbeatable price-to-portion ratio, which makes the pizza more than worth it. Service here is impressively swift -- the line moves quickly, and the pizza is served piping hot, straight from the oven.

Seating is sparse, so be prepared to join the crowd munching on paper plate-held slices outside. The pizza could have done with a bit more cheese and the Pepperoni was somewhat on the bland side, but a sprinkle of garlic powder and parmesan from the counter did the trick in ramping up the flavor. Whether it's a quick lunch or a casual dinner, this spot delivers on speed and value.",1
10868,"Title: Delicious Dumplings and More

My recent visit to this spot left me pleasantly satisfied. The dumplings, though not exactly life-changing, were solid contenders in the flavor department. With a reasonable price point, this place is definitely worth a try—I'd happily rate it 4 stars out of 5.

We opted for a trio of fried dumplings but there was a mix-up, and we ended up with two servings of pork & chive instead of one and one of the pork & cabbage. Hence, I can't comment on the latter, but the chicken & basil dumplings were surprisingly the standout for me—and I’m usually a pork aficionado!

The duck noodle soup was another highlight, brimming with taste, while my friend's shrimp dumpling soup didn't disappoint either. If you're in the area and craving cozy comfort food, this is a spot to consider.",1
15790,"Quality has gone down in the past few years. I ordered the Pad Thai again, but this time, I asked if they could make it spicy. Apparently to them, this just means to add extra salt/fish sauce. I was only able to eat half before my tongue started to get numb from all the sodium, and I didn't want it to fall off. I paid $18 (including tax and tip) for some Bad Thai. On the flip side, my colleague ordered the chow fun and said it was bland AF. Guess they saved all the salt for my dish.Wei West was the go-to for team outtings since it is close to the office and can usually seat large groups (I say usually because this past time we went, our group of ten was seated by the sushi bar, even though we made reservations ahead of time). Kind of defeats the whole purpose of a team lunch. Will be looking for a new spot next time.",0

21127,"Excellent restaurant in Little Italy! On a nice sunny day, you can enjoy the views inside or outside of pedestrians and bodega shopping around the Chinatown and LI neighborhood.As mentioned, they serve complimentary bread (wood fired, fresh, and delicious). For lunch, I had the lasagna ($20), which came in a simmering metal bowl. It was a great combination of meaty and cheesy, and a nice portion size to boot (pun intended).I'd definitely come back here for the kind service and great food. Look forward to trying a few other options (pro tip- ask for the lunch specials not on the menu).",0

Seated comfortably at the bar, I found myself quite pleased with both my meal and drinks. Although the burger I ordered leaned towards the saltier side for my taste, it wouldn't deter me from trying other options on their diverse menu in future visits. A special shout-out is deserved for their outstanding hot sauce—it's a must-try! Overall, I left the restaurant feeling very satisfied and would recommend it to others looking for a pleasant dining experience.",1

We splurged on the crab cake appetizer, which came with a $5 surcharge, but it was absolutely worth it.

All in all, a fantastic dining experience that I'd highly recommend.",1
10978,"The popular Korean dakgalbi restaurant chain, HCC has finally arrived! I was there on a Wednesday night around 6:30pm. The line was very long. I checked in with the host and put my name down for two people. They use Yelp waitlist but you cannot do it on yelp yourself, you can only do it at the restaurant with the host. The restaurant is on a second floor, besides Abiko. We waited 1.5 hour for the table. They have many dakgalbi flavours but you have to start with a minimum of 2 order for each flavour.  We got the kimchi cheese with medium spicy. If you cannot handle spicy, I'd suggest getting the mild spicy. Medium spicy was spicy but acceptable. A little more than that would be too spicy for me. Kimchi cheese comes with stir fry chicken, kimchi, onions, yam tempura, rice cake, and cheese. We also ordered ramen and fish roe fried rice on the side. The waitress mixed the ramen with the chicken and kimchi on the plate, finished with dried seaweed. When we finished half of the plate, the waitress came back with fish roe fried rice (mixture of rice, kimchi, and fish roe). We also ordered makgoli. Everything was so good! Would come back again! Be prepared for the wait though!",0
20359,"Title: Lively Ambiance, Average Fare

My dining experience on a recent Friday night was a tale of two stories. The atmosphere at the restaurant was absolutely electric—a live band had everyone tapping their feet, and some guests were even dancing between the tables, lending a celebratory vibe to the evening.

The band truly stole the show with their impressive performance; unfortunately, I can't say the same about the food. The chicken entrée and ceviche were just passable, and when considering the price tag, they were a letdown. The cocktail also failed to leave a memorable impression.

On a brighter note, the service shone through. The staff were attentive and prompt, ensuring our basics needs were met despite the bustling environment.

To sum up, if you're after a vivacious night out with live music, this spot might hit the right note. But if it's culinary excellence you're after, you may want to look elsewhere.",1
11619,"I recently had the pleasure of dining at a charming Greek restaurant that boasts a wonderful atmosphere, earning a solid 4 out of 5 across the board for overall experience, decor, service, and food. The interior is delightfully quaint, whisking you away to the breezy isles of Santorini with its cute and authentic touches.

The menu is a treasure trove of Greek classics. The lamb chops, available in various sizes, are perfectly grilled with a simple yet delicious blend of olive oil and herbs. The Greek salad is a refreshing mix of crisp cucumbers, ripe tomatoes, sharp onions, and creamy feta cheese. The standout for me was the charred octopus—two generous legs for a reasonable $18, showcasing both value and flavor.

Each dish is thoughtfully served with warm, fluffy pita, enhancing the authentic Greek dining experience. This spot has firmly established itself as my go-to for Greek cuisine, offering satisfying portions and quality food at prices that are truly fair.",1
193,"I have eaten at other Mana Sushi locations and ordered delivery but this was my first time at this location. First impression, the dining space is much larger than the other restaurant, with plenty of seating available for large parties. The dining space is clean and well organized. I wasn't a fan of the tiny bathroom but you're here to eat so it's forgivable. We made it early enough that it wasn't too busy. Our waitress was friendly and got us started with a pitcher of sangria while we browsed the menu. I stuck with my favorite, Chicken Teriyaki bento box. It comes with a side salad, rice and four sushi rolls served with your main dish. Is worth the price and filling. I will say the music is more lively at the other location I have visited. It defiantly helps to liven the place up. Above all, the food was good and I left happy. I would recommend this spot for group gatherings, good sangria and delicious sushi rolls. We will be back!",0
12479,"Very expensive for a dim sum type restaurant. The mushroom xlb was interesting but difficult to eat. I didn't really care for the truffle shrimp dumplings, though my bf was a fan. The pork buns also seemed undercooked... I'm used to a nice sweet glaze on top too, but it just tasted like uncooked dough. Overall, the food was very nicely presented, but just ok taste wise for me.

They serve sushi in the beginning, sashimi, vegetables,  dessert. We were impressed in the beginning because their sushi was so goood despite of tiny pieces/size (compare to other sushi places in nyc), but we were not happy at the end as they served food totally opposite way. They should serve vegetables (If they really need to serve vegetables in their course -_-), sashimi, sushi and dessert. We asked our waiter what the strategy was to serve in this way and he said it cleans our palates as we move along to the lighter dishes... hmmm. I dont know about that.2. I am not paying $185 to eat vegetables.. They have 3 different veggie courses in their tasting menu - mushroom, cauliflower and sweet potato with toasted bread. Even if they are organic, super fresh or whatnot, I was not expecting to have vegetables in our course, especially when they charge for $185 for tasting menu. I am here to eat sushi, not vegetables..3. menu clearly said we will be serving 18 courses, but we only got 17 food courses (6 sushi, 1 foie gras, 3 vegetables, 5 sashimi, 1 wagyu and 1 dessert - as you can see in my pictures). I wonder if they count 1 pairing sake drink we received as one of their tasting menu, then this place is totally a scam. sake doesnt count as food. also sake did not taste good at all. It smelled like soy sauce.. also missing shrimp in omakase? hmmm... 4. We ended up spending $600, 2 x 18 courses, 4 drinks, tax and tips.. but we weren't full at all.. We had to go to different restaurant because we were so hungry and spent more money there.5. They should definitely reduce their price based on what they serve here. I get that they serve A5 wagyu, etc.. but still.. $185 is way too high. maybe $100-125 is fair. What a disappointment we had on Friday night. I will email the restaurant manager/owner to see why we were only served 17 food courses. I have been to Sushi Nakazawa many many times (which also means I do not mind spending $$$ on expensive sushi), but I wouldn't come back to this restaurant!",0
20553,"Title: A Delightful Happy Hour Find

I recently visited this charming spot for a friend's birthday celebration and was pleasantly surprised by our experience. We arrived at 5pm on a Tuesday, which was perfect timing for Happy Hour, and were quickly served with refreshing pitchers of beer for our group of four.

As a soba enthusiast, I couldn't resist ordering the cold soba with beef toppings. The soba noodles were notably fresh, giving off a healthy vibe without compromising on taste. The accompanying sauce was well-balanced, not too salty—a relief for anyone who dreads the post-meal thirst.

My friends enjoyed their choices of additional soba, tempura, and udon. Despite the tempura being slightly oily, it was within the expected range for fried dishes. Service was prompt, allowing us to satisfy our appetites without a prolonged wait.

Overall, the combination of tasty soba and hearty beef toppings left a lasting impression. This is definitely a place worth coming back to, and I find myself wishing it were closer to my workplace for those lunchtime cravings. Highly recommended for a casual, delicious dining experience!",1
18330,"Title: A Flavorful Feast at Manting – A Dry Pot Delight

Last Tuesday, my three friends and I ventured into Manting around 7 pm and were immediately struck by the bustling atmosphere. Luckily, our reservation ensured we were seated promptly despite the full house.

Manting charms with its casual, café-like vibe. The create-your-own dry pot experience is particularly engaging – just like building your own sandwich at Subway, which allows for tailored meal options and an up-close look at the fresh ingredients.

The service was top-notch; the servers were exceptionally friendly and knowledgeable, ready to offer suggestions and guide us through the menu based on our spice preferences.

Our dining highlights included the dry pot – a flavor bomb, hands down the best I've ever had, with perfectly cooked meat that melded with the spices and pepper. Another standout was the diced chicken, a crunchy and spicy delight with a tangy vinaigrette kick – unmissable!

For something slightly less intense, the vegetable malatang was our go-to, served with a moderately spicy broth that danced on the tongue, accompanied by fresh veggies and tender rice noodles.

The only slight letdown was the shredded potato, which was plentiful but lacked the expected spice punch. Still, it was a decent enough dish.

In summary, Manting is a gem worth exploring, especially for the dry pot and diced chicken. A visit here promises a memorable meal that will leave your taste buds singing with joy!",1
3672,"Title: A Cozy Culinary Gem in East Village

Review:
Stepping into this East Village treasure, I was immediately charmed by the warmth of its cozy, casual ambiance that beckoned from both outside and within. The menu, though visually daunting with its myriad of food photos, piqued my interest with promises of flavorful adventures.

Among the standout dishes were the delightfully crunchy fried squid legs and the rich, fatty salmon belly, which though lightly seasoned, proved utterly satisfying. The seaweed-topped fried rice was a symphony of diverse ingredients, while the thinly sliced cow tongue surpassed my usual encounters with the delicacy. And the eggplant? My friend hit the nail on the head describing it as ""very clean"".

Our experience was further sweetened—quite literally—by the novel treat of making our own cotton candy with the provided sugar, a whimsical touch that added to the evening's enjoyment.

Taste-wise, I'd rate this place between a 4 and 4.5. Its atmosphere easily earns a 5 for sheer comfort and appeal. The presentation of the dishes was a solid 4, while service was commendable at a 3.5. All in all, this spot earns a well-deserved 4.5. Would certainly recommend for a fun and tasty outing.",1
1926,"One of my new favorite omakase place. The chef and waitresses were really friendly. They have the option of 12 pieces, 15 pieces and 16 pieces. Highly recommend the 16 pieces omakase, it's really worth it! You get a lot of uni and truffles (if you like them) otherwise you can do the 12 or 15 pieces. Every piece of sushi actually stood out to me because of its own uniqueness in taste and presentation. I've been to few Michelin places and a lot of pieces tasted similar in my opinion but at Sushi Ishikawa, I was able to recall how each piece taste at the end of my meal. If you want to try something different from the traditional omakase, definitely give this place a shot! I do recommend making a reservation in advance to sit at the bar.",0
10818,Buttery and beautiful lobster rolls! I've had them before at a different location and they're just as good. The staff weren't warm and welcoming and it was hard to find seating in the busy food hall. Try a different location if you're wanting to sit and eat your meal there.,0
2357,"Title: A Mixed Grill Experience at Pit Master

Rating: 3.5 out of 5 stars

My visit to Pit Master left me with a mixed plate of opinions. I dove into the signature $32 plate that promised a meat-lover's dream: beef brisket, pork rib, sausage, chicken, and a couple of sides to boot.

The standout was undeniably the jalapeno sausage – a must-order item. It packed a juicy, flavor-filled punch that did not disappoint. However, the beef brisket, which came with the option of moist or lean, failed to live up to the 'moist' promise. It lacked the tender, fall-apart quality one craves in a good brisket.

The pork ribs showcased good seasoning, with the fattier ends delivering the succulent taste I was after. Yet, the rest of the rib was merely average at best. As for the chicken, it was nothing out of the ordinary – just your standard fare.

The unexpected hero of the meal was the mac and cheese. It was creamy, cheesy, and exactly what you'd hope for in this classic side – a definite must-try.

In summary, while not all the meats hit the mark, the highs were indeed high – especially with the jalapeno sausage and the indulgent mac and cheese.",1
20238,"Title: A Surprise Ramen Delight Next to Friedman's

Upon an unexpected 45-minute wait at Friedman's for brunch, my companion and I stumbled upon a ramen spot next door and decided to give it a try. What a pleasant surprise it turned out to be! We were quickly seated in a cozy booth and handed a customizable order sheet for our ramen—a novel touch that added to the experience.

The service was efficient, and the call button on our table ensured our orders were promptly taken. Intrigued by the unique offerings, we couldn't resist trying the matcha beer, which proved to be a refreshing accompaniment to the meal.

The ramens arrived swiftly and did not disappoint; the harmony of the flavorful broth and perfectly cooked noodles was delightful. Plus, the option for a complimentary noodle refill was much appreciated—I happily indulged, given the tastiness of the ramen and some leftover broth.

The final bill for two bowls of ramen and a beer came to just over $50. It's worth noting that tipping is included in the price, and no takeout containers are offered, which speaks to the restaurant's dine-in experience focus.

Certainly, this was a unique and thoroughly satisfying ramen encounter—one that warrants a return visit.",1
12538,"Impeccable sums up my dining experiences at Per Se. My 5 star ratings are few and reserved for memorable, eventful, and lofty dining experiences. My encounters with Per Se have alway ended with a) would I return b) was it worth it c) is there room for improvement. Both a and b are a definite ""YES"" and c I really needed to stretch expectations to identify any flaws. So c ended up as ""not really"". Every visit has been worth the hefty price tag. The food is imaginative, artistically plated, and delightful to your palate. Service is top notch and the dining area, spacious. It may resemble a feeling of being on a cruise ship to nowhere (which I didn't mind). Bon appétit!",0
11460,"Title: A Delightful Brunch Experience at [Restaurant Name]

I recently visited [Restaurant Name] for brunch with reservations at opening time, and it was a wise decision. The place quickly filled up, so reservations are a must. The service was remarkable; the staff was exceptionally attentive, with our waiters ensuring our water glasses were never empty. A complimentary selection of flavored pastries, resembling petit cake balls, was a pleasant surprise and absolutely delicious.

For the main course, I opted for the bacon cheeseburger, which delightfully came with an ample amount of bacon. It was cooked to my exact preference and did not disappoint, although the accompanying fries were rather standard. The latte I ordered was a great beginning to the meal, both in taste and size.

The ambiance of [Restaurant Name] deserves a mention too. It’s super cool, with clean, well-designed interiors extending even to the bathrooms. Overall, this place is a total win for a satisfying brunch in a stylish setting.",1
15654,"Tucked away and easily missed, this delightful gem was a serendipitous find right across from our hotel. The highlight of our experience was undoubtedly the soup dumplings, which were nothing short of perfection. Equally impressive were the handcrafted noodles, made by an artisanal chef visible through the dining room window, adding a touch of culinary theatre to our meal. Generous portions left us more than satisfied, yet with pangs of regret as we couldn't take our leftovers for our imminent flight. A visit that ended on a high note of deliciousness tinged with sadness – a testament to the quality of the food.",1
19794,"Love love love this Thai spot!!! I found it randomly one day on Yelp, searching for a new lunch spot before a show or dinner after a show! The food is just like the name -- authentic & delicious! I've tried a couple of items but all in all my absolute favourites from here include the Pad Thai, the pineapple fried rice & ESPECCCIIIAALLLLLLLYYYYY the Massaman curry. It's absolutely phenomenal and I love it with the tofu and the rice soaks up all the juices! Yum yum yum ! Just wish it had some more veggies in it like the Green Curry does. I will come by soon for their lunch. They have a sister restaurant next door for noodles I've yet to try. Next time!!!!",0
19378,"Title: ""Craving More from Mama's Too - A Pizza Gem on the Upper West Side""

After my third visit to Mama's Too, I can confidently say this Upper West Side pizzeria is a must-try for any pizza aficionado. Each slice offers the perfect harmony of a crispy exterior, coupled with just the right amount of gooey cheese and savory pepperoni – an indulgence that's consistently satisfying, even when enjoyed via delivery.

While other reviews may point to service hiccups, my experience has been solely about the pizza's excellence, which has never failed to impress. I'm already looking forward to my next slice and would urge anyone in the area to give Mama's Too a shot. Their pizza quality is indisputably top-notch, making any service shortcomings a secondary concern. Trust me, your taste buds will thank you.",1
17423,"The food is a awesome!! The ratio of the tortilla and the meat were perfect. The sauce added another perfect kick to it. Note that this place had no seats nor a restroom for public use. The line was like a constantly wave, but it would get super long. They even prepared a queue outside the store. The servers were very nice. The environment here was like a fiesta. We would have given this place a five stars if there's a restroom.",0
13739,"Title: A Veggie Delight at Fig & Olive

I recently dined at Fig & Olive, conveniently located just across from the Omni Hotel, and it was a fantastic choice for a vegetarian meal. The bellman's recommendation was spot on!

Seating was swift thanks to a quick check on Yelp for wait times, and we landed a cozy spot upstairs with plush cushioning and a serene ambience. Though the name of my dish escapes me, the vegetarian salad featuring quinoa, figs, and an array of fresh ingredients was nothing short of delicious. My friend equally enjoyed their meal.

Service was impressively speedy, and I must give a special shout-out to the rosemary bread—it's a 'must-indulge'! Fig & Olive has certainly earned a repeat visit from me.",1
11920,"This dim sum place is definitely worth going to. Much better than Jing fong in my opinion. Food was good. The dim sum itself were pretty good. Personally my favourite are the cha shu (pork) buns, but they were not that great... The other standard dim sum items were good though.The wait time wasn't very long despite all the people who were waiting ahead of us. The yelp waitlist app works and allowed us to get on the line queue as we were close by. The place itself I thought was clean (in chinatown standards). And if you're expecting a quiet dim sum place, you're looking for the wrong thing.",0
17987,"I recently had the pleasure of dining at this charming restaurant and couldn't be more delighted with the experience. The ambient lighting inside created a warm and inviting atmosphere, perfect for a cozy date night. The service was top-notch, with attentive staff that made the meal all the more enjoyable. A standout feature was the platter of diverse, flavorful dips complementing the complimentary bread - a simple yet delightful touch. The quality of the food didn't disappoint; it was both delicious and well-presented. I'm looking forward to returning to this delightful spot in the future. Highly recommended for anyone seeking a great meal in a lovely setting.",1
17579,"Came in for breakfast and there was nobody in the front room where the host stand is.  We walked to the back and were told to seat ourselves.  I feel like a sign in the front room would be helpful.  There was loud music playing that didn't really appeal to all audiences.  I ordered The New Yorker, which was a bagel and lox essentially.  At $19, I was prepared to eat the most expensive bagel I've ever had in my life.  It's Manhattan and it was our last meal before heading home, so I didn't stress over it too much.  However, when I was served the bagel, it was hard as a rock.  I managed to eat a quarter of it because I didn't want to be that girl sending food back, but ultimately I had to say something because I just could not pay $19 for a bagel that was barely edible.  I'm embarrassed for the restaurant that they even served it to me.  They have 4.5 stars on Yelp so I expected them to hold themselves to a higher standard.  I was prepared to give the restaurant a 2-star review after the bagel and seeing a lip print on a ""clean"" glass, but because they apologized and took the bagel off my bill, I'll give them 3 stars.  My boyfriend's breakfast sandwich wasn't as bad, but it wasn't anything spectacular either.  The only redeeming thing we were served was the rosemary potatoes.",0

2100,"Had the most fantastic experience here. This place is one of my favorite omakase spots and it's actually pretty worth it. It came with several appetizers, 15 pieces, a hand roll, a soup, and a macaron along with a cup of green tea. Each piece was delicious. The chef was very friendly! We ordered sake as well and we got to choose our own sake cups which I found out were handpicked by the chef when he goes back to Japan. The prettiest sake cups that I wish I could purchase!!",0
1075,"Nestled in the heart of Chelsea, the restaurant impresses with its expansive floor-to-ceiling windows that promise a bright, inviting atmosphere for brunch. Unfortunately, the fare doesn't live up to the vibrant setting or New York City's culinary standards. My shakshuka experience was particularly disappointing, eclipsing poor renditions I've had across three states. The dish, an unappetizing pool of oil with scant flavor, consisted mainly of tomato chunks aimlessly floating in a greasy red sea with a token sprinkle of chickpeas. Witnessing the preparation did little to salvage the experience, as the kitchen's generous use of oil and scarcity of other ingredients were all too visible. On a positive note, the service was both attentive and friendly, but sadly, that alone isn't enough to redeem the underwhelming meal.",1
1209,"Title: A Brunch Delight at Bubby's

Bubby's is a brunch haven, even on a dreary rainy day when the crowds are proof of its popularity. Be prepared for a wait, but rest assured, it's worth every minute. 

Their Cold Pressed Green Juice, priced at $7, is the epitome of refreshment – an absolute must-try. Complementing the juice, the coffee stands out with its robust flavor, perfect for kick-starting the day.

As for the main course, the fried chicken and pancakes are a match made in heaven. The chicken is succulently juicy with a batter that's beyond compare, while the pancakes are the epitome of fluffy goodness. Fair warning: the portions are generous enough to potentially require a shareable strategy, even for those with a hearty appetite.

My husband's choice, the eggs Benedict with Canadian bacon and homestyle potatoes, was quite the contender too, but the chicken and pancakes reigned supreme. 

Bubby's proves to be a masterclass in brunch cuisine. Whether it's the ambiance, the juice, the coffee, or the delectable food, this place ticks all the right boxes.",1

But the hostess was very polite and made the wait feel like nothing. I think the next time I visit, I will l be doing their omakase menu. We sat next to the bar and I was green with envy; everything looked delicious.",0
2980,"Title: A Delightful Pit-Stop for Snacks and Sips

I popped into this charming eatery for a casual bite while my kids enjoyed a party nearby. The visit, around 3:45pm, was perfectly timed to beat the rush, with an abundance of tables to choose from. The staff promptly seated us and were more than happy to accommodate a special request for an espresso martini not listed on their menu—a choice I didn't regret and would happily repeat.

The food followed suit in quality; both the calamari rings and fries met the mark with their commendable crispiness. A glass of white wine complemented the selection well, contributing to a relaxed snacking experience.

The ambiance added to the appeal, with decor that charmingly whisks you away to a bygone era. While time constraints limited my exploration of the menu, the experience was enough to ensure I'll be returning for a more extended visit soon.",1
13846,"I like this spot a lot. It's very Italian. Every staff speaks Italian here haha. It's a cozy small restaurant with great vibe.We ordered two appetizers, cheese with ham and Sicilian rice balls. Both were really good. For the main course, I got spaghetti with clams. I have never had this taste before. Must be Sicilian specialty. It was not heavy at all and well cooked. Desserts were great. We had 3 kinds, cannoli, tiramisu, and chocolate cake. All of those were delicious. Cannoli has 3 per order and each is small. Great for sharing. Portion for dessert is big. A table can share.Service was awesome. Our waiters were very friendly and welcoming. It's also very cheap here. The only thing was that the restaurant is way too small and it's very crowded.Overall, this is a great place for the price.

18882,"I recently visited this restaurant with a group of friends, and we were all thoroughly impressed by the culinary experience. To start, the burrata and beet salad were exceptionally fresh, setting a high standard for the meal to come. Their wine list was quite extensive, offering excellent pairings for our meal.

We indulged in a variety of mains – sweetbreads, lamb ragu, spaghetti, fish, and pappardelle – and each dish was met with unanimous praise for its excellence in flavor and preparation. It was everyone's first visit, and the satisfaction around the table was palpable.

This restaurant has certainly earned a return visit from me, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for delicious food in a welcoming atmosphere.",1
15253,"Love this spot! You see the cook right in the front barking out orders and there's cozy seating in the back. A small menu but everything is tasty. We got the oxtail soup which was so good - honestly could drink the broth alone all day. Also got the dan dan noods which are really spicy!! This dish is made differently everywhere - it's so tasty and peanutty but I was drinking mad water. They bring dishes out as they're ready, so the only part that was less than ideal is I got my dish maybe 10-15 min later than my friend",0
14005,"Title: Green Bites Galore: A Mixed Vegan Experience

My visit to Green Bites Galore was a journey of highs and lows. On the upside, the fully vegan menu is a true delight for plant-based patrons, and the ample seating means no awkward waiting for a table. The kitchen deserves applause for their speed, as dishes arrived promptly after ordering. Additionally, the staff's passion for veganism shone through, adding a personal touch to the dining experience.

However, the culinary execution was a bit of a rollercoaster. While some appetizers were enjoyable, others seemed to be lackluster, with a heavy reliance on frying what appeared to be frozen items. An overuse of sauces seemed like a tactic to disguise the food's true quality.

Service-wise, one notable hiccup was our eager waiter who whisked away plates and essential condiments before we were quite finished, disrupting what could have been a more relaxed meal.

In summary, Green Bites Galore hits some right notes for a quick vegan bite, especially if you're in a rush, but there's room for improvement in both the kitchen and on the floor.",1
3579,"Title: A Long Overdue Praise for a Filipino Brunch Gem

Despite it being nearly two years since my visit, this Filipino brunch spot in the East Village has left a lasting impression on me. My girlfriends and I walked in close to the end of brunch service, and while our server seemed a bit rushed initially, he warmed up and turned out to be very accommodating – especially with our cocktail requests. We savored both the kalamansi and mango mimosas, which were delightful.

While my friend's mussels were underwhelming and the side of fries disappointingly limp and seemingly fried in stale oil, our overall meal was enjoyable. Another friend had the Chola burger, a substantial offering that she found very satisfying. I opted for the Longsilog, which was a tasty choice. Although I haven't been back since, I'm looking forward to a return trip. Next time, I plan to experience their dinner offerings and, without a doubt, their desserts.",1
15194,"I recently had the pleasure of dining at a restaurant where I indulged in their bacon and eggs for $30, and I must say, it was unquestionably worth every penny. The space is absolutely stunning, creating an inviting atmosphere. The food? Simply perfect. What stood out was the impeccable balance of professionalism and warmth in the service, making the experience all the more enjoyable.

The attention to detail was evident in every aspect of the meal. The coffee was robust and flavorful—a great companion to the meal. As for the star of the show: the eggs were served hot, cooked to perfection. Accompanying them, the bread could not have been fresher, toasted right on the spot, adding a delightful crunch to each bite.

The avocado added a creamy, ripe texture that complemented the other components of the dish beautifully. And let's not forget the sublime bacon—thick, with the perfect blend of sweet and salty notes, and just crisp enough to satisfy that quintessential bacon craving.

For two people, the meal came to $80 with the tip included. Given the quality of the food and the overall experience, it was as good a meal as I've ever had. If you're on the fence about paying a premium for a classic breakfast staple, take my word for it: this restaurant takes bacon and eggs to a whole new level.",1
12840,"Title: A Letdown of Nostalgic Proportions

I revisited a once-beloved spot for dim sum, only to be met with a profound sense of disappointment. The magic I remembered from my younger years was absent; the dishes were uniformly bland, a mere shadow of their former glory. Each bite was a reminder that what once was, was no more.

The chicken feet were not only served cold but also had the stale taste of neglect. Similarly, the shrimp encased in rice paper suffered from the chill of indifference. A repeat order of pork ribs did arrive with some semblance of warmth, but the lack of juiciness left the dish languishing in mediocrity.

Yes, I arrived at opening time on a Thursday, expecting perhaps not perfection but at least effort. The least they could do was serve their fare at an appropriate temperature. Instead, I was left with the feeling of being short-changed, my one dim sum experience in NYC now tainted with regret.",1
15793,"Have been wanting to try this location based on the reviews and recommendations by friends. However, was disappointed by the food itself. Pho that came out wasn't really hot, the proportion of soup to noodle was 30% soup to 70% noodles. Due to the soup not being hot, the noodles weren't as chewy, and the beef wasn't really cooked. If visit, recommend trying the spring rolls (chicken and shrimp), dipping sauce is very thick (do not recommend using). The springs rolls by themselves is delicious!!!",0
12661,"What a solid lunch experience today. We did all the ""known for"" dishes, and I've now been indoctrinated to this establishment. Service is pro.

Empanadas that I can get at a food truck, three for $23?!?!  But yea, they were good too. Completely dry, not oily, super hot temp, flavors perfect, dough did its job. The raw fluke... flavors required me to close my eyes and feel the texture and taste in my mouth. The citrus oil was good enough to drink. As for the arroz con pollo, the crisp stole the show. I'm guessing they used par-cooked rice, it separated perfectly and the chicken was firm and soft in all the right places. Fantastic lunch spot, and I'll be back.",0
17329,Felidia is a high end Italian restaurant with high end service with jazzed up Italian fare. We had the restaurant week 3 course prix fixe. The food was delicious.

It did not disappoint. The Manzo was also good. It's a rather simple dish but delicious. Also try the salmon. Not bad. The service was is of a high end restaurant with your every need looked after.

16815,"While the dining experience was passable, the value for the $185 price tag didn't quite align with expectations.

However, several standout items did grace the menu, notably the delicate Kumamoto oyster, succulent fresh water eel, silky scallop, earthy mushroom, rich Hokkaido Miyakzaki A5, and decadent foie gras. These highlights managed to add a level of sophistication to the meal, but couldn't fully compensate for the shortcomings.",1
15309,"Good food and there was no wait when we went on Saturday lunch time. There are about 40 cubes that you can sit and enjoy your noodle. They have short menu items, but overall consistent good taste. Its about twice of price compared to in Japan, maybe I was spoiled since I got to try it couple times in Japan in different cities. Overall good place for lunch. They have special now till 3/2020, complementary extra noodles that is if you are still hungry after eating nice portion noodle. They have water machine, if you just want to get water for drink with food. No tipping as it's one of rule. I would recommend for experience, if you like experience to sit in cubes and have noodle come from front of you and you don't get to see servers face. They have app that you can collect points, but point system is some what impossible to get to (they should do like every 10, you get free noodle).",0
19332,"I recently dined at a local hotspot on a bustling Friday night, thankfully snagging a table with a 5:30 PM reservation. Arriving early proved wise as the place swiftly reached capacity. Our table feasted on a delightful array of dishes, from savory large chicken wings split between soy garlic and fiery spice, to a flavorful shrimp scallion pancake, comforting kimchi fried rice, and tender bulgogi adorned with caramelized onions. Surprisingly, a simple side salad stole the show, its earthy beets, ripe baby tomatoes, and crisp mixed greens harmoniously dressed in a sweet vinaigrette that delivered an unexpectedly divine gastronomic experience.

The vibrant atmosphere complemented the excellent cuisine, with the wait staff showcasing genuine kindness throughout our visit. My satisfaction was complete, and I would eagerly return when next in the neighborhood.",1
17374,"Title: A Scrumptious Sojourn at Scampi NYC

If you're ever scrolling through foodie pages on Instagram and stumble upon the Mafaldini Scampi from Scampi NYC, do yourself a favor and double-tap. Better yet, go there. This seemingly simple shrimp-and-butter noodle dish transcends its humble appearance with a complexity that is both nostalgic and gourmet.

As a child, I was enchanted by the buttered pasta samples at Costco—Scampi NYC's signature dish evokes that same joy but elevates it to new heights. Their Mafaldini Scampi, with its ribbon-like noodles, luxuriates in a rich crustacean stock, zesty lemon, and white wine that enliven the butter-based sauce. It is topped with breadcrumbs for a subtle crunch that makes every bite a culinary revelation.

The menu has more to tantalize your taste buds; the tuna tartare, for example, is a triumph of freshness and acidity, ideal for pairing with the scampi for a meal that sings.

Although a post-workout appetite limited my sampling, the modern vibe and warm staff ensured a delightful dining experience. Scampi NYC is not just a meal; it's a gastronomic journey worth relishing. Kudos to the team—I'm already looking forward to my next visit!",1
12077,"Title: Cozy Chinese Cuisine with a Side of Seasonal Endurance

If you're on the hunt for a decently priced Chinese meal that won't leave your taste buds feeling like they've taken a dip in the Dead Sea, this might be your spot. Noteworthy is their shrimp toast - a delicacy not often found in similar establishments - which proves to be a delight without overwhelming your palate with salt.

However, be prepared to dine with the seasons as your uninvited guests. In the throes of winter, you might find yourself dining with your coat still buttoned, as the restaurant’s heating seems to be on an extended vacation. Summertime offers a slightly better scenario, with no air conditioning, but it's a step up from the zero breeze of a stuffy office break room.

In short, this Chinese joint is worth a visit for the food and prices, but maybe eat here in the spring or fall for maximum comfort.",1

2816,"Title: Exquisite Lunch at Jean-Georges' Culinary Haven

Review:

From the moment I stepped into the flagship restaurant of the renowned Chef Jean-Georges, I knew I was in for an exceptional dining experience. The sophisticated ambiance was heightened by the bright, airy dining room with its lofty ceilings.

I opted for the 4-course tasting menu, which commenced with an umami-rich clear broth that perfectly primed my palate. The bread selection was a testament to quality, served with sublime butter. My first course was the signature Yellowfin Tuna Nest, delicately paired with avocado and soy dressing—a fusion of simplicity and finesse.

My colleague's corn ravioli, a choice from their vegetarian offerings, was a dish that resonated with pure corn essence, and I consider it the highlight of the meal in terms of flavor.

The peekytoe crab dumplings that followed were nothing short of spectacular, especially when the aromatic broth was poured, tempting me to savor every last drop. The Japanese Snapper's spice-crusted skin concealed the moist, tender flesh beneath, complemented by a medley of mushrooms and vegetables.

Dessert was a visually stunning array of ice creams, sorbets, and ganaches, each a delightful burst of flavor. A surprise addition to our meal was the chocolate cake recommended by the sommelier—a deliciously gooey and indulgent finale.

The service at Jean-Georges was as refined as the food. Our server was adept at matching the mood of our table with lively and attentive care while offering a more subdued approach to neighboring diners.

Though the price point is steep, the value is evident in the caliber of the cuisine and the personalized attention. This is not just a meal; it's a culinary journey. I am already looking forward to my next visit to this gastronomic treasure.

16552,"Title: A Delightful First for Filipino Cuisine

I experienced Filipino cuisine for the first time at this vibrant spot during their Sunday brunch, and it was a revelation. The energy was palpable with fantastic music and a bustling crowd, all complemented by an impressive open kitchen. Seated at the bar without delay, I was treated to an up-close culinary show. The lychee mimosa was a refreshing choice, while the sizzling sisig was a flavor-packed introduction to Filipino delights. Next visit, I'm bringing friends to indulge in the bottomless mimosas!",1
13603,"My husband and I came here spontaneously on a Friday night, without prior plans and without a reservation. We were able to be seated immediately, and were given copies of the menu and water immediately. I hadn't previously heard any good things about this restaurant, but I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt.We ordered, and our food was served in around 20-30 minutes. My husband had pork vermicelli, while I had the catfish vermicelli. Neither one was outstanding, but they weren't terrible either. I left feeling full, but was disappointed with the quality of the food, and wouldn't come back.",0
14546,"I was fascinared by the fact that they had Mexican and Korean food and the same time, since that combination never came to my mind before, and I was excited by that. I asked one of the servers what was the most popular thing people usually order and he gave me the suggestions of the chicken bowl.I ordered a purple rice bowl with some grilled chicken, vegetables with some japchae, kimchi, and bean sprouts. The combination was mediocre and honestly it was very average, not tasty it at all. The chicken did not go well with the purple rice. My opinion is partial because I am not Korean nor Mexican. I can only speak from my experience.",0
12923,"Title: A Delightful Dining Experience at [Restaurant Name]

My recent visit to [Restaurant Name] was an utter delight with stellar food and exceptional customer service. Upon arrival, we were immediately seated, a pleasant surprise given the bustling nature of the restaurant. 

We kicked off our culinary journey with a selection of empanadas, each bursting with flavor and cooked to perfection. The attentive service was noteworthy; our waiter consistently kept our drinks topped up, reinforcing the restaurant's commitment to customer care. Even the manager made rounds to ensure our dining experience was nothing short of perfect.

The highlight of the meal was the Cuban sandwich, which was packed with authentic flavors and masterfully prepared. But the true star of the show was the tres leches cake. It was an exquisite dessert that I can only describe as a slice of heaven—every bite better than the last.

In summary, [Restaurant Name] delivers on all fronts, promising both gastronomical pleasure and top-notch service. It's a must-visit for anyone looking for an enjoyable meal in a welcoming atmosphere.",1
18722,"I popped into Toloache for brunch and found the ambience charming with its lovely interior. Despite the quiet atmosphere due to few patrons, the service was attentive and pleasant. While the drinks lacked strength, the chicken quesadilla was a standout – simple yet exceptionally prepared and perhaps one of the best I've ever enjoyed. I would suggest making a stop at Toloache for the quesadillas alone; they're definitely worth the trip!",1
2725,"My friend took me here for the Christmas special omakase. It's in the heart of Flatiron and I loved the ambience. The sushi bar is pretty big and classy. The Christmas special came with two appetizers, a glass of wine or sake, 14 pieces of nigiri, one piece roll and dessert for $120/pp. For appetizers, we had the oyster tartar and monkfish liver. When I first tried monkfish at a different restaurant, I was grossed out. TEISUI's monkfish was surprisingly delicious. If you're wondering how the texture is, it tastes like pate. For the nigiri, the fish was so fresh and each piece was made with much detail. Some of my favorites were the scallop, super fatty tuna, wagyu with uni and Japanese barracuda. One thing I would change is the rice. It looked like it had a lot of flavor but it didn't taste that way. I also thought the roll would be a handroll because I saw some people next to us get that but that is probably part of the regular omakase menu. Either way, the one piece roll had yellowtail and salmon with uni and black caviar, which, believe me was heaven. The service here was so quick and efficient that I almost wished the chef slowed down to explain each piece. Overall, I really enjoyed my experience here and would deff recommend. Plus, the roasted green tea ice cream with matcha mochi is a must-try if you still have room for dessert!",0
18557,"Not as good as the UES location, but still fast and delicious.Used a mealpal to get a Bali bowl. Super good flavor and surprising spice. I wish I had asked for a little extra curry sauce. Just make sure you mix up the bowl before you eat.",0
2093,"Momosan is what classic ramen should be. Flavorful but not salty, pork slices soft and succulent, soft boiled egg (see Totto review), and all ingredients supporting a hearty meal that satisfies the tummy. Compared to Noodle Bar (see Momofuku review), although you could taste the tare, there's not a biting saltiness the keeps you from downing the broth with joy. Service is a little slow and not meticulous compared to those staffed by first gen Japanese, but getting a good bowl of ramen that's not too expensive ($12 for regular) can overcome the slight. In three days, three ramen shops, I give the victory to the Iron Chef!",0
16318,"This restaurant is located in the heart of East Harlem and it's absolutely lovely. The ambiance is cozy and has an authentic Italian vibe down to the music. I had a strawberry mojito that reminded me of a margarita but it was made with wine. It was light and refreshing. I started off with the crab cakes which had a mildly spicy chipotle sauce. It was great. I ordered the short rib ravioli entree (10 piece)  and it was well seasoned and distinctive. I enjoyed my entree very much. The waiter was both enthusiastic and endearing. He never fails with his suggestions. The entire wait staff is wonderful. I've been here a few times and I've never been disappointed with my entrees, however, recently they added a large tv, which I feel takes away from the charming ambiance.",0
20318,"This is my favorite place to grab margaritas ($14) for a classic; ($15) for flavored (blood orange, jalapeno cucumber, pomegranate, and guava). I've been to this place multiple times, and you should not need a reservation unless you have a large party. Besides the beautiful margaritas, we ordered the guacamole classic ($14), their guacamole isn't the best I've ever had but is still okay. For an entree we ordered the nachos ($13), which is plenty for an entree or shared appetizer. We also got the Shrimp Quesadilla ($17), which comes with a scoop of guacamole on top. This place is an excellent spot to grab a drink after work or class with friends",0
18224,"Title: A Spicy Thai Delight at Somtum Der – A Solid Four-Star Experience

After a long day of travel and city exploration, my quest for soul-warming larb led me to Somtum Der, a casual Thai eatery that surpassed expectations without any unnecessary fanfare. The restaurant's cute décor and wait staff's coordinated outfits offered a charming experience without falling into the gimmicky trap that some chain restaurants do.

The early dinner timing meant we beat the rush, but by the time we finished, the place was bustling – a good sign in my book. The Larb Moo was the star of the evening, packed with heat and flavor, just as we hoped. Accompanying our main dish were the coconut marinated beef skewers, nothing short of spectacular. Paired with a glass of wine and a beer, the meal hit all the right notes, even with modest portion sizes, which frankly, I appreciate.

As with any restaurant experience, there were a couple of hiccups. My beer arrived sans glass, and a request was needed for a frosted mug, which should have been offered given they were ready to go. The sticky rice, which we declined, found its way to our table anyway – though it did complement the larb quite nicely.

Despite these minor oversights, Somtum Der has won my vote for a potential return visit. It's a great little spot that could reach new heights with a tighter ship. I'll give them another shot, but with the competitive dining scene in NYC, they'll want to ensure they maintain their edge.

20399,"Title: A Surprising Find on a Busy Saturday Night

I'm finally getting around to writing this review after a spontaneous dining adventure led my friends and I to this hidden gem on a packed Saturday night in New York. Usually, you'd need a reservation to dodge the wait times, but fortune favored us when we stumbled upon this place.

The ambiance might not scream traditional Japanese, but the menu begs to differ. I enjoyed a steaming bowl of Nabeyaki udon that was a harmony of umami broth, perfectly chewy noodles, crisp tempura, and fresh vegetables. My friends sampled an array of dishes from pork katsu curry rice and ramen to sushi and a salmon appetizer. Each dish exceeded our expectations without trying too hard.

While the food was unexpectedly good, providing a decent dinner at a fair price, the service was admittedly sluggish. The waitstaff were slow to take our order and the kitchen wasn't exactly swift. Still, the experience was satisfactory overall.

Although I wouldn't call it a culinary revelation, it was by no means a disappointment. A spot worth noting for those evenings when you find yourself without a reservation and with an appetite for Japanese cuisine.",1
10238,"Title: Majestic Setting, Mediocre Cuisine at Grand Central Gem

Nestled within the historic grandeur of Grand Central Station, this restaurant wows with its stunning decor and breathtaking architecture. The experience of just sitting and absorbing the ambiance is a treat in itself. Arriving at 8:30 PM, our party found the restaurant preparing to close, which was a bit surprising. A policy requiring all guests to be present before seating felt strict, yet once we were seated, the service proved speedy and attentive.

Our table enjoyed a bevy of drinks and an oyster platter that did not disappoint, with each variety offering a unique taste profile to savor. However, the main courses—swordfish and seabass, each over $30—did not live up to the same standard. The dishes, limited to a small portion of steamed fish accompanied by a sparse array of vegetables, lacked the expected burst of flavors and seemed scant for the steep price. With hardly any seasoning to speak of, the lemon provided became our main source of flavor.

In conclusion, while the setting is impressive, the culinary experience falls short, especially considering the price. The seafood aficionado within me says the oysters are worth a try, but I'd steer clear of the fish mains unless you're content with style over substance.",1
20987,"Came here for dinner in a group of 3 on a Wednesday evening at 9:15 pm. The place was pretty packed and we got the last available table.Pros:1. Great ambiance! Love the flowers and the chandeliers!! Makes the place very pretty! 2. Happy hour martinis for $6!3. The food was very delicious. Cons:1. Service was average. 2. Portion size was smaller than expected. Need 1.5 entree per person. Recommendations:Spicy pad kee mao: Very flavorful. Lives up to the ""spicy"" in the name. Puff: More on the sweeter end (likely due to the sweet potato). Not a big fan of sweet appetizers. Spicy basil fried rice: Very flavorful, good feel of the spices and basil. If you are someone like me who likes less vegetables in their rice/noodles, you will love the food here!",0
15757,"On a recent rainy day, my team and I found comfort in the offerings of Real Kung Fu, a cozy spot where dumplings seemed like the perfect remedy for the weather. The restaurant lived up to our cravings, serving truly delicious food that warmed and filled us.

We indulged in an array of dumplings, complementing them with hearty noodles and ramen. The standout for me was the soup dumplings; their savory filling encased in delicate wrappers was a taste to remember. While the meat dumplings had a more robust flavor compared to the veggie options, they were notably heavier – something to consider depending on your appetite.

Portion sizes at Real Kung Fu are generous, to say the least. An order of soup dumplings was ample to satisfy my hunger. Anyone visiting should keep this in mind – your eyes may be bigger than your stomach. All in all, it's a place I'd recommend to anyone in search of a filling, comforting meal.",1

1506,"Title: Mixed Feelings at Shabu Garden in K-Town

My venture into K-Town's burgeoning hot pot scene led me to Shabu Garden, where my anticipation was met with a touch of disappointment. The service started on a confusing note when our voucher restrictions were not clearly communicated, ultimately resulting in us being unable to use the promised check-in promotion. This experience left me questioning the integrity of their Yelp reviews, which seem influenced by discounts for positive feedback.

The hot pot experience itself was a shadow of what I've relished at a favorite spot, Spring Shabu. While Shabu Garden follows the commendable strategy of offering unlimited vegetables and carbs with paid meat options, both their selection and quality fell short. The meat, in particular, didn't match up to that of other establishments.

In terms of their menu, the restaurant would benefit from incorporating traditional touches like sesame paste to enhance the flavor profile, not to mention a sweet note—perhaps ice cream—to round off the meal.

While I'm pleased to have another hot pot venue in Midtown, Shabu Garden wouldn't be at the top of my recommendations list for those in search of this delectable cuisine.",1
19964,"BCD Tofu house is a great place to chill with friends or if you're craving soondubu or tofu stew. During peak hours, you'll definitely have to wait and they generally seat you when your entire party is present. I ordered the mild dumpling soondubu. A whole small fried fish was given first to each person at the table. The whole fish is edible including the head and it's good. What fried food isn't good?! Then banchan or side dishes were placed on the table. I really liked everything except for the pickles, but I'm not a pickle person. The kimchee was the perfect amount of spicy and sour. There was a savory root vegetable marinated in soy sauce or something that was really good and addicting. When my soondubu arrived, I cracked an egg into it and moved the egg to the bottom of my bowl so it cooked. I enjoyed the tofu and the stew, however, I didn't really like the dumplings. The dumplings did not really taste like anything. There were also beef strips in the stew and they were really tough and hard to chew. Overall, I do like BCD because it is comfort food and it's a good place to warm up in the winter. Definitely worth a try.",0
12627,"Tucked away with a basement-style entrance, this small cash-only gem requires a keen eye to spot—and a bit of patience on weekends due to its popularity. Once seated, the experience is nothing short of amazing. The menu offers fairly priced, delicious fare perfect for sharing. Standouts include the duck fried rice and crispy honey beef, while the General Tso's chicken, despite an abundance of vegetables, remains a tasty choice. Complimentary crispy noodles kick start the meal, and the egg drop soup and chicken wings are generous in portion and flavor. Despite a packed house, dishes arrived swiftly—with less than a 20-minute wait. Exceptional food quality, prompt service, and reasonable prices make for an experience worth repeating.",1
12100,Me and my buddy first official slice of genuine NYC pizza and did not disappoint. It was actually my favorite slice I had on my entire visit to NYC. johns at Times Square was second.

18678,"Title: A Dim Sum Haven in the Heart of Times Square

Review:
Finding authentic dim sum in Manhattan can be a challenge, but this gem located steps away from Times Square breaks the mold with its exceptional offerings. Unlike the typical haunts in Flushing, this establishment serves up freshly made dim sum that tantalizes the taste buds with every bite.

The service here stands out from the crowd, offering a kind and attentive touch that is often a rarity at traditional dim sum spots. An added bonus for those braving the New York chill is the cozy, boxed-in area provided for guests to comfortably wait for their tables.

Once seated, the ambience takes you by surprise. The romantic setting, complete with crisp white tablecloths, elevates the dim sum dining experience to a new level of sophistication.

A standout was the Chui Chow hot chili oil - a perfect accompaniment to the dim sum, served alongside soy and duck sauce. It adds just the right amount of kick to each dish, leaving you uttering 'Yum!' after every mouthful.

In summary, this restaurant is a must-visit for dim sum aficionados and novices alike, who are looking for quality fare with a dash of elegance right in the bustle of Times Square.",1
14122,"Nestled on the ground floor of Food Gallery 32 in Koreatown, Jian Bing Man could be a hit-or-miss depending on your previous encounters with this classic Chinese street food. If you're new to jian bing, the offerings here might leave you satisfied, providing a decent introduction to the dish's signature style. However, for those who have savored the authentic, roadside jian bing in China, like myself, the fare here may disappoint.

The restaurant boasts a selection of items, but its namesake jian bing is the star. Keep in mind they have a strict policy on credit card payments, so make sure your order meets the $10 minimum or carry cash to avoid any hiccups.

Service speed is another area where Jian Bing Man falls short; the preparation lacked the quick, efficient pace that is hallmark of street-side jian bing stalls. While the aesthetics of the dish were reminiscent of my Chinese mornings, the flavors didn't follow suit. Opting for the signature jian bing with spicy savory soybean sauce, I found it lacking in the robust flavors of sauce, green onion, and cilantro – all essential for that authentic taste kick.

Although Jian Bing Man didn't live up to my memories, its convenient location in Manhattan might tempt me to give it another chance in hopes of an improved experience. In summary, Jian Bing Man might be worth a try for newcomers to the dish, but for those seeking to recapture the essence of their jian bing experience in China, this spot may not hit the mark.",1
10830,"We stumbled upon here when Hometown hot pot was too long of a wait and I'm so glad we did! We ordered the hot and spicy fish noodle soup (not on the menu but one of their specials), the braised beef noodle soup, two of the duck jian bing(special also), a mango basil tea and chrysanthemum tea. The jian bing was so good! They added something thinly fried in the crepe which gave it so much more texture and the contrast crisp was really satisfying. The fish noodle soup is soooo good. They give you a good amount of fish and the spice of the broth is very flavorful. Would definitely recommend this place!",0
2349,"Title: A New York City Gem for Seafood Lovers

My recent visit to an NYC seafood restaurant, spurred by an enticing Groupon deal, turned out to be an absolute delight. The highlight of our meal was the two dozen East Coast blue point oysters—each one tasting of the ocean's essence. 

Venturing into new territory, we tried the ""Take Me Home"" martinis, a novel twist on the classic with a fusion of house tequila, mango nectar, and zesty lime. It was quite the revelation that tequila and martinis could dance so well together. 

Our appetites were further indulged with the Asian Fried Oysters, a dish that impressed us both with its perfect crunch and harmonious mix of seaweed salad, wasabi mayo, and house-pickled veggies. 

As for the main course, I sampled the quinoa and couscous accompanying my husband's crispy salmon filet and found it to be quite tasty. My husband expressed nothing but satisfaction with his choice. 

Throughout our dining experience, Miguel, our attentive server who shared our Philippine roots, ensured we were well looked after. I can't recommend this restaurant enough for anyone in search of delectable seafood and creative cocktails in the heart of New York City.",1
17693,"Sugarfish is EVERYTHING! Being a native Los Angelian I'm def biased but seriously if you like sushi or if you're new to sushi this place caters to any and all sushi eaters. There's a variety of set menus pre fixe style called the ""trust me's"" and there's also a la carte options and specials. Service is great and gratuity is included which makes life just a little easier when dining out. If you love sushi, like sushi, or wanna try sushi sugarfish is your spot.",0

The drinks, crafted by the talented bartender Stacy, were nothing short of phenomenal, setting the stage for the remarkable meal that followed. 

The food was extraordinary, each bite a testament to the kitchen's culinary prowess. As for hospitality, the customer service was impeccable. Our server, William, went above and beyond, embodying the very essence of friendly, attentive, and welcoming service. 

The ambiance of the restaurant hit all the right notes, creating the perfect setting for a memorable dining experience. I'm already looking forward to my next visit, with plans to indulge in their weekend brunch. If excellent food, fantastic drinks, and top-notch service are what you seek, this is the place to be.

I will absolutely be coming back on my next visit!",0
208,"Title: A Slice of Heaven on Prince Street

As a dyed-in-the-wool New Yorker, it took an outsider's tip to uncover the treasure of Prince Street Pizza, but since then, it's become my regular haunt. This joint is a must-visit for any pepperoni pizza aficionado; their famous pepperoni square is nothing short of sublime. Imagine a chunky, yet impeccably crispy cornerstone of pepperoni-laden goodness, with each mini roni expertly toasted until it forms a deliciously crispy cup to hold the perfect amount of grease. Here, the crust strikes an ideal balance—robust but yielding that oh-so desired crunch complemented by a tender interior.

Though my pizza palate has yet to wander from the tried and true pepperoni square, my repeated visits testify to its consistent allure. Patience is a small price to pay for such a delicacy—I'd stand in line for a good half-hour for these slices. And believe me, in a city buzzing with options, that's saying a lot.",1

I also indulged in some noodles that were so appetizing I couldn't pause to snap a photo. Alongside the excellent food, the service was commendable. I wholeheartedly recommend this spot to anyone looking for a satisfying bite in the Big Apple.",1
10906,"I recently visited this local eatery with high hopes for their much-talked-about dumplings, fried pork buns, chives buns, and sesame pancake. While the dumplings fell short of their neighbors’ culinary delights, the pork buns lacked the succulent juiciness one would expect, and the chives buns were disappointingly dry, with no soft, flavorful filling to compensate.

However, the sesame pancake was an unexpected star, elevating the entire experience with its light, crunchy texture and appealing hint of salt. This dish alone is worth the visit and combined with noodles from next door, it would make for a perfect meal.

In conclusion, if you're stopping by for the exceptional sesame pancake, you're in for a treat. Otherwise, the experience might not live up to expectations. My rating for the restaurant stands at 4 stars, contingent on the sesame pancake's performance.",1

This place has quickly ascended to the top of my brunch favorites list!",1
13964,"This pizza place is truly the savior of ravenous late night hunger in Penn Station. They always have a long line of drunk people (myself included sometimes) but there's about 20 guys behind the counter and the line moves quick. They have an enormous selection to choose from and I have tried a great deal however I must say, their eggplant pizza is BOMB AF. It's actually the best eggplant pizza I have ever had, and I've had it while sober too so it's not tipsy tastebuds swaying my vote. The slices aren't cheap tho, 2 slices are a little over $10 by itself. They also sell bottled soft drinks, beer on tap and some calzones, hot pretzels and rolls. The employees are quick and for the most part polite and efficient. They actually have plenty of seating for those who aren't taking this to eat on the train. I wouldn't advise a female who's by herself to eat alone there tho, I had a few incidents where a random drunk guy would come and harass me. One time I had to ask the Spanish guys behind the counter to tell this drunk loser to leave and they saved me with no hesitation. Another time a crackhead bum came and grabbed my water bottle, the employees gave me another one with no issues at all. Now I just take my slice on the run. Rose's is a Penn Station staple, no late night train ride home would be complete without a stop here!",0

12284,"Title: Mixed Feelings at Gaby's Brunch

My friends and I had a somewhat underwhelming experience at Gaby's during restaurant week for Sunday brunch. Admittedly, it felt a bit foolish once we realized their regular $26 brunch deal included free coffee, which the restaurant week offer did not – a detail we overlooked in our laziness to find another spot.

Service was pleasant, though not particularly swift. The restaurant was far from crowded, yet simple requests like bringing lemons for our water were met with a 10-minute delay. Those in a hurry might want to take note of the leisurely pace between courses.

The winter salad appetizer was the star of the meal – a delightful mix of textures and flavors, with macadamia nuts, mild goat cheese, perfectly grilled endive, and the acidity of dried tomatoes. It was so good, I'd prefer it as an entrée. The duck Bolognese, however, was merely passable and lacked the option for freshly ground pepper, an oversight on my part for not requesting it.

The major letdown, however, was the misinformed response regarding service animals when we called ahead. The staff requested documentation for our service dog, displaying a lack of training and awareness of the laws regarding service animals. To avoid the potential for a denied service, we chose not to bring the dog, but this incident left a sour note on our experience.

Due to these factors, especially the issue with the service dog, Gaby's earns a 3-star rating from me. With the abundance of dining options in NYC, a return visit seems unlikely.",1
15030,"It's been awhile since I've been to Jane, and it'll be awhile before I go back. Today was a great reminder why I stopped coming. It's just blah. Jane is one of those places that have been here at least 20 years that I can remember, and they bank on being Jane. They don't really do much to improve or change things up. Jane simply cruises on its glory days and its reputation as a must brunch spot. But, why?First things first. The service at Jane is excellent. The staff is awesome. They're sometime a little slow. But, the servers are on the top of their game. And well they should be. With the prices and tabs here, they're guaranteed to bank nice tips from being good at what they do. I have no complaints about that. That said ... if you were to take down the sign in front and put up the word diner, and added a few less perfect looking servers with aprons on, it would hands down pass for a regular diner. There's nothing special about the decor. It's dated, and probably hasn't been made over since they opened. Go downstairs to the powder room, and the lower level dining area looks like something you'd expect at a Ramada Inn or one of those places that offer a community continental breakfast. I had the burger. Jayson and Michael had eggs Benedict, and one of us, who wasn't me ordered French toast as well. It was tasty. We loved our food. Now, none of us drink anything stronger than sparkling water and cappuccinos. Yet, somehow, without any alcohol, our breakfast for three came out to $148, without tip. None of minded, per se. But, I keep wondering for what. This easily could have been a burger and Benedict at Cafeteria or any number of overrated, over populated and still quasi-trendy places So, great service, and good food, at extremely overrated prices with no real justification.  I'd happily pay triple that for something innovative and interesting, or at least made with ingredients you couldn't find at Whole Foods or Jefferson Market. It's just ... It's just this. Jane is the place you go to for brunch when you're too lazy to make the effort to look for some place more 2019, not so much 2009, or you've Googled ""brunch places NYC"" and end up here because some magazine editors still keep this once fabulous eatery on their list.",0

The by-the-glass wine list is short and sweet, and most of it is in happy hour. I had a nice rosato, but there's something for all. No liquor outside of Aperol for spritzes.Fit dinner I had their daily soup which was a chicken minestrone filled with lots of beautiful vegetables. It's a giant bowl so beware! After, I had a pizza that started with a B that netted me fennel sausage and broccoli rabe - pizzas are a perfect size for a hungry single or a shared bite between 2-3.

It's funny that I have spent about half of my adult life dining at L'Express for breakfast, brunch, lunch, dinner, and post-drunk feedings at 1am, 2am, 3am, you get the picture.I would classify this L'Express as a classy diner, mainly because it is open 24/7. In all of the years that I've dined here, I can honestly say that I've never had a problem with the service or the food. I will be honest and say that I have not tried too many things, outside of croque madames and beef tartare, on the menu, but I have never been disappointed with those items. Well . . . back in the day, the croque madames were served with two sunny-side up eggs instead of one (I'm just being nitpicky). In addition to food, L'Express has a very wide array of wines, beers, and special cocktails so there is a little bit of something for everyone. All in all, if you want a low key meal, easy meal in the Union Square/Gramercy area, this is the place for you.",0
20782,"Sup Crab is where trendiness and value collide, nestled in the bustling crossroads of LES/Chinatown. This seafood haven boasts an extensive menu, with delights ranging from the fiery chili blue crab to an array of temptations such as crawfish, shrimp, and even snails. Not to be overlooked, the Szechuan offerings like chicken chili or Dan dan noodles satisfy those craving land-based fare.

Appetizers like spicy crispy rock shrimp set the stage, but don't be fooled by labels—the ""appetizers"" such as spicy popcorn chicken and cauliflower pork are hearty enough to pass for entrees. For the main course, the lamb chops are a hit, but it's the crawfish over rice that steals the spotlight with its rich sauce, perfectly accompanying the tender seafood and veggies, topped with a fried egg.

The popcorn chicken, with its home-style breading punctuated by peppers, and the surprisingly satisfying cauliflower pork stand out with their robust flavors. Service is as delightful as the music selection, adding to the overall enjoyable atmosphere.

Sup Crab is an exceptional pick, notably when dining with a crowd—the family-style servings are ideal for sharing. A trip here comes highly recommended for an experience that tantalizes the taste buds without emptying the wallet.",1
16211,"Decent Chinese food! Must give the rating to justify the items I tried today, which are recommended. The Garlic fried pork chop as the entree and the dessert - fried rice cake. The pork chop is tender and soft, tasty. The rice cake is soft, tasty. Hmm, I am out of words to describe, you need to try yourself to understand what did I mean. I didn't try their other branch at 6th ave, different menu, and I would say I like this one better? Will come back for more items.",0
18610,"After a spontaneous detour before our train journey home, our detour to this little gem of a restaurant was a decision well-rewarded. It's crystal clear why this spot maintains its five-star ratings. The service we received was nothing short of wonderful, and it's apparent that the kitchen prioritizes freshness, sourcing ingredients from impressive, far-off locales. 

Patience is a virtue here, as the preparation takes time, but the resulting dishes are undeniably worth the wait. We savored the Newyorkese Piada, a flavorsome marvel where every ingredient, particularly the onions, melded in harmonious delight. We also indulged in the Toscana Piadizza, where the peppery arugula and tangy sauce perfectly complemented the delicate prosciutto.

To top it off, the introduction to their customer loyalty program was the cherry on top, hinting at many future visits — a card I anticipate filling up with ease. A true culinary highlight that made our extra steps before our train ride home utterly worthwhile.",1
15466,"Title: Hearty Portions and Authentic Flavors at Midday

I ventured into the restaurant on Monday at the peak of the lunch rush around 12:15 PM and found myself amidst a small queue of patrons eagerly waiting to be seated. After a brief 20-minute wait, our party was ushered to a table where a delightful culinary experience awaited us.

We indulged in the marinade beef and pork with chive rice noodle roll—a dish generous with meats and equally large in portion. Despite the price tag, the size and quality justified the cost. The Lai wan style assorted congee, along with the sliced pork, liver, and kidney congee, presented a comforting blend of flavors that did not disappoint. The pork liver was notably tender and a standout highlight of the meal.

Although the fish skin and sweet cruller had sold out earlier, a substitute of dough sticks proved to be a harmonious accompaniment to the congee, enhancing the overall dining experience.

We capped off our meal with the classic HK style milk tea, which was perfectly brewed and provided a soothing finish to our hearty meal.

In summary, despite a wait and a few items being unavailable, the abundance and authenticity of the food made for a satisfying lunchtime visit.",1
13710,"It seems I discovered Chef's Club too late, at the tail-end of their glory days. I was here three times for their Paul Liebrandt residency, and I was here three times for their Terrance Brennan residency. During those visits, I noticed not just a continual decline in service quality, but also a very high turnover rate of the servers. One visit, I ordered a drink, after waiting at least 30 minutes, I asked about it, they disappeared for a few minutes then came back and slammed it down and barked ON THE HOUSE as if I had done something wrong. Another visit, I ordered a drink, after waiting at least 45 minutes, I asked about it, they disappeared for a few minutes then came back and slammed it down and barked PLEASE ENJOY YOUR FREE DRINK LIKE THE LAST VISIT WHEN YOU ALSO GOT A FREE DRINK IT'S ON US I HOPE YOU ENJOY IT BECAUSE IT'S FREE, as if I had done something wrong. Speaking of slamming things down angrily, that is precisely what happened when (during my third visit to Terrance Brennan's residency) I was served a medium-well Duck Breast, and when I said it was overcooked for my liking (when everyone else, including my dining companion, received theirs medium-rare) they yanked it away and quickly replaced it (SMASH) with a beautifully cooked one. Apparently the very high turnover of chefs and also of waitstaff leads to an atmosphere of abject anonymity? I took a few months off Chef's Club, hoping the air would clear, but apparently the exact opposite occurred. Sometimes, rather than peaceful resolution, downtime can lead to malignant festering. Within seconds of their announcing an upcoming residency for Osteria Delle Tre Panche (TRUFFLES TRUFFLES TRUFFLES), I made a reservation, there's absolutely no way I would miss this. So, a few weeks later, when confirming my reservation, they tell me, somehow, someone had already reserved the seat I requested (hard to believe, but whatever), and that parties of 1 or 2 were restricted to 90 minutes while parties of 3 or more were restricted to 120 minutes -- which to me is not only offensively unequivocal, but, frankly, abusively taking advantage. $30 for a first course of Mozzarella, $50 for a second course of Ravioli, $20 for a side dish of Mashed Potatoes, $60 for a third course of Beef Filet, and $20 for a fourth course of Cheesecake --  that's $180 before tax and tip (excluding alcohol), so $230 with tax and tip, and more than $400 (per person) for premium wine pairing (including tax and tip). Yet they confine meal durations to 90 minutes for what should be a glorious once in a lifetime special event? How do they expect me to enjoy a meal of four courses and four drinks within 90 minutes (for parties of 1 or 2), when it takes them 45 minutes just to bring one drink? Sadly, it seems they have outgrown their original concept and are, sadly, resorting to blatantly-exploitive money-grubbing tactics.",0
2365,"Title: A Visually Stunning Experience with Mixed Culinary Impressions

Upon entering the restaurant, I was immediately struck by the stunning ambiance and decor that alone merit a five-star rating. The interior was both beautiful and inviting, making it a place worth visiting on aesthetic grounds alone.

For my meal, I chose the chicken pad krapraw, anticipating an exceptional experience as suggested by the establishment's glowing reviews. Unfortunately, the dish failed to leave a lasting impression. It was decent but lacked the distinctiveness I had hoped for.

In contrast, my companions thoroughly enjoyed their meals, suggesting that the kitchen's prowess might extend to other items on the menu. Based on their satisfaction and the restaurant's enchanting atmosphere, I am inclined to return and explore more of what the menu has to offer.",1

The service is excellent and the place is conveniently located. I was a little disappointed with my corn tempura.  I am comparing it with my favorite which I have ordered 3 times each visit in Ginza.  I was looking forward to it but although the presentation here was better, the oil ruined the taste of my clean fresh taste of corn tempura I was looking forward to.  I did not want to complain there and then.I had the fried chicken wings.  Those had good clean flavor.  No oily taste.I was happy to be able to compare the uni from Japan and the uni from California.  This is why I ordered both.  I can only try to compare them side by side here in New York.I plan to go back again.",0
18153,"I recently dined at this charming spot for a weekday lunch and was thoroughly impressed with both the food and service. The Warm Pistachio Crusted Goat Cheese Ball was a delightful surprise, especially for someone who isn't typically fond of goat cheese. It's a must-try dish that has won over even a skeptic like me.

We also indulged in the Salade d'artichauts, one topped with perfectly cooked chicken and the other with flavorful smoked salmon. Both salads exceeded expectations - they were exceptionally tasty and raised the bar for what one could anticipate from a salad.

To complement our meal, we opted for wine flights, which were thoughtfully paired with our selections. The overall experience was delightful, and I would highly recommend this restaurant for anyone looking for a scrumptious lunch with attentive service.",1

Looking to satisfy my sushi cravings with a twist, I stumbled upon Chikarashi while searching for ""good poke near me"" on Google. The cozy space of this eatery comfortably accommodates about 4-5 diners, making it a gem more suited to delivery or pickup.

I opted for the Goma Shoya Tuna with ginger, and it did not disappoint. The fish was impeccably fresh, and the blend of flavors tantalized my palate, leaving me very pleased with my selection. Although the price point is a bit steep, it's what one might expect from a New York eatery. Overall, Chikarashi delivers a delightful poke experience worth trying for those who appreciate quality and taste.",1

We indulged in an array of dishes including the minced lamb samosas, the spicy chicken 65 appetizer, butter masala, lamb korma, a meat sizzler platter, chicken biryani, garlic naan, and garlic paratha. 

The standout for me was the lamb korma, which was exceptionally flavorful and rich, coupled with the garlic paratha that was generously stuffed, leaving a lasting impression and a garlicky souvenir. While the prices are a touch above average, the food quality justifies the cost.

The service matched the high standard of the food; it was both swift and cordial. While the menu has much to offer, I'm tempted to return to face the phaal challenge. Whether you're a spice veteran or just looking for quality Indian cuisine, this spot is worth the visit.",1
1544,Best Chinese food in Manhattan. The soup dumplings are amazing. This midtown location accepts cards and reservations which is great because the China Town location is cash only and first come first serve and always packed.

18950,"What a fun and unique dining experience only found in Japan and at this location in the US!I went with some family friends to Zauo, and had so much fun catching our dinner! The process is quite complicated, but the servers are kind and patient and walk you through everything. We were first sat down with our waters, and given ""fishing licenses"" to wear around our necks. After deciding from our menus which dishes we wanted, the servers guide us to the respective tanks (either upstairs or downstairs), and gives the designated fisher a poncho and fishing rod. The flounder / flat-type fish upstairs were much easier to catch - I just hooked one up in 30 seconds. In contrast, we waited about 15 minutes before we managed to even lure a salmon or bass in! After catching the fish and taking pictures, the servers take the fish into the kitchen, where it is then prepared in whatever option you order. There's also an option for chef's choice that our server offered where they choose for us, so that could also be the best bet for indecisive eaters like me that want to try it all!We ended up fishing a fluke and a striped bass, and had the fluke and bass prepared as half-and-half orders: a hotpot-like soup base with raw and thin slices of fluke, salt-grilled, steamed, and made into tempura. Everything tasted delicious, and after we finished those off, we also ordered the Tako Kara-Age (fried octopus), Agedashi Go Tofu, Salmon Mazemen (salmon sashimi over ramen noodles), Torotaku Roll (fatty tuna with pickled radish roll), Shrimp Tempura Roll, Kanpachi Gomadare Ae (amberjack with sesame sauce), Lobster Roll, and Zauo Signature Roll, all pictured down below. For dessert, we had the Matcha Tira""MASU"" and a red bean-based ice cream with rice cakes. Everything tasted fantastic and exquisite, but the dishes themselves weren't extremely filling for the five of us in our party because of the small portion sizes. Overall, the concept was super fun, and the experience was one I will never forget. A drawback to the dishes was probably that everything here is extremely expensive, and it's uncertain that the kitchen truly prepares the entirety of the fishes we caught because it felt like there was little food in proportion that came from them. I would probably come back given that it's a really unique dining experience, but for a special occasion or to treat somebody out, which I'm thankful to my family friends for doing!",0
299,"Title: Disappointing Dining Experience

I recently visited a local eatery with high hopes for a cozy dinner experience, drawn in by the promise of their much-touted Arepa Chips. While the chips did live up to their reputation and are indeed a dish worth trying, that's where the positives ended.

The service was lackluster and disorganized at best. My fiancé and I were left waiting for an excessive 45 minutes for our meals, witnessing several parties who arrived after us receiving their orders with frustrating promptness.

Once our food finally arrived, the atmosphere did little to enhance our experience. A small and cramped dining space contributed to an uncomfortable meal, complete with a persistently barking dog and a seating arrangement so tight we were privy to the full conversation of the couple next to us.

Requests for the check further extended our stay, adding another 20 minutes of unnecessary delay to the evening. Additionally, the lack of a drink menu necessitated a game of 20 questions with the staff to determine our options.

In summary, unless you're visiting solely for the Arepa Chips on a quiet weekday, this restaurant may not be worth the hassle—especially during the busy weekends. It's unfortunate to report, but I find myself unable to recommend this establishment based on our experience.",1
18391,"Title: A Hidden Gem for Dumpling Lovers - Little Tong Review

If you're a dumpling enthusiast like myself, Little Tong is a must-visit! This quaint little nook charmed us the moment we entered. Our server swept us off our feet with her warmth and had us settled in no time.

The menu - an ode to uniqueness - tempted us with its descriptions. We couldn't resist the grandma's chicken mixian and the Chinese broccoli salad. A complimentary starter of shrimp dressed in a mysterious pesto alongside wood ear mushrooms set a high bar, delighting us with its flavors.

The broccoli salad, with its crunchy garlic chips and zesty citrus soy, was a revelation. Then came the mixian, a dish so artfully presented with edible flowers, it was almost a shame to disturb its beauty. Thankfully, we did, because the broth, reminiscent of the most comforting chicken soup, and perfectly al dente noodles, were gastronomic joy.

Little Tong earned my hearty recommendation, and I can assure you, it won't be our last visit. Hats off to Little Tong for an exceptional experience!",1

18727,"Title: A Letdown at a Beloved Pizza Spot

Having been regulars at this pizzeria for years, my expectations were set high based on numerous positive experiences. However, our latest visit was a stark letdown. The service hit a sour note right from the start, with a waiter who couldn't seem less interested in attending to us. This inattentiveness might have been somewhat forgivable had the food been up to par, but, regrettably, it wasn't.

We ordered our customary dishes – the crowlers and the Emily pizza – but both arrived lukewarm, a puzzling outcome considering the lengthy wait time. To make matters worse, the pizza was served uncut, and it lacked its usual moisture, coming off as uncharacteristically dry.

It's painful to write this about a place that's topped our list for so long, but this visit was truly disappointing. As much as it saddens me, I find myself questioning when, or if, we'll decide to return.",1
2307,"I recently dined at a charming spot that caught my eye with its aesthetically pleasing dish presentations. One of the items I tried was the creamy corn, which, albeit beautifully presented, was heavier on mayonnaise than I would have preferred.

18049,"Title: Au Cheval NYC: A Windy City Gem Lands in the Big Apple

My latest culinary adventure took me to the new kid on the block in NYC's burger scene: Au Cheval. This Chicago transplant has nestled itself among the likes of corner bistro legends, and let me tell you, it holds its own. 

From the moment I stepped in, the vibe was electric—think great ambiance, just the right volume of background tunes, and service that couldn't be faulted. The staff were attentive and knowledgeable, ready to dive into detail on any query.

What you're really here for, though, is the burger. Opt for the single stack, but don't be fooled; you’re getting two patties of meaty perfection. It’s juicy, flavorful, and cooked to a T. The mustard aioli and chopped red onion add just the right zing, but feel free to ask for tomato and lettuce. You won't need ketchup, and while you can top it with bacon or egg, the burger stands proud without them. (Though, personally, the egg was a tad salty and the bacon didn't bring much to the party.)

Don't miss out on their coffee—it's robust and wakes you up the right way. If you're in the mood for something with more kick, the Bloody Mary is a masterpiece, accompanied by a thoughtful beer back.

And yes, do try the bone marrow. Served with buttered brioche toast, it's a rich and indulgent counterpart that's not to be overlooked.

Verdict: Au Cheval is a welcome addition to NYC's burger joints and has quickly become a top contender in my book. Cheers to Chicago for this export—I'm already planning my next visit.",1
16513,"Excellent place to grab a bite for under $13. The burritos are about $12 - they're huge as well as extremely filling and really healthy.

1636,"Title: Charming Ambiance, Mixed Dining Experience

My sister and I visited this restaurant on Valentine's Day, drawn in by its romantic appeal. The decor, with its inviting glass windows and elegant chairs, set a lovely stage for our meal. However, the tables felt cramped for the amount of food we ordered, leading to some awkward plate-shuffling by the staff, who were also a bit delayed in offering to check our coats.

The vegan options and fresh hot bread were a definite plus, and the wine selection didn't disappoint. I did find myself missing Hendrick's gin from the spirits list, though. We started with a decent hummus and enjoyable eggplant appetizers. My main dish, an okra creation, unfortunately, struck a sour note with its excessive acidity. A redeeming end to the meal was the Turkish coffee – an absolute delight.

Service was commendable, earning four stars, but the dishes were hit-or-miss. While the ambiance was enjoyable, I can't say I found it a strong value overall considering the price point. It's a charming spot for a first date, but I likely won't return.",1
17869,"I recently visited a spot that truly deserves praise for their culinary creativity – a restaurant that serves ravioli vodka sauce pizza, and let me tell you, it's a masterpiece. The pizza crust here strikes the perfect balance of toasting, offering a solid foundation for the real star of the show: cheese-stuffed ravioli atop the pizza, bathing in a vodka sauce that's flavorful without being overly salty. What's more, if late-night cravings strike, this place has your back – it's open until 4 AM. The ambiance adds to the experience with its warm, cozy lighting making the seating more than just decent. As someone who typically steers clear of carbs, this indulgent dish has earned its place as my occasional go-to treat.",1

Our staples include the irresistibly stuffed masala dosa and the savory uthappam, often paired with appetizers like fluffy idly or crispy medhu vada. Each dish arrives with a side of perfectly spiced sambar and chutneys, flavorful yet not overly spicy. The extensive menu leaves us eager for the next visit, as there's always something new to try.

16845,"Title: A Shanghai Surprise That Delights

I was recently treated to a culinary gem that completely exceeded my expectations. Every aspect of this restaurant, from the attentive service to the remarkable array of Shanghai specialties, left me eager for a return visit.

The menu is a vibrant showcase of unique flavors, including their standout soups — one served traditionally in a bowl and another ingeniously encased within a dumpling. The creativity didn't stop there; the shrimp dumplings, tinted with squid ink, were a revelation to the palate.

The entree featured noodles, also infused with squid ink, marking my first foray into this ingredient. The result was an emphatic triumph of taste that has me reminiscing and craving more.

Dessert was unfamiliar territory, challenging our taste buds, but served as a clear reminder of the diversity in Shanghai cuisine.

This eatery is a must-visit for anyone seeking an extraordinary dining experience. I'm counting down the days until I can relish their flavors once more.",1
17988,"Title: A Buzzing Brunch Spot in Inwood

I recently visited a trending brunch location in Inwood with friends and enjoyed a relaxed Saturday brunch. The process of reserving a table was straightforward and didn't require any deposit, which was a plus.

Upon arrival, there's a $5 mandatory coat check, a slight inconvenience price-wise, but the friendly security made up for it with their guidance to our table on the second floor. Note there didn't seem to be elevator access, which could be a challenge for some guests.

The brunch venue boasts excellent natural lighting, thanks to the ample windows, and the decor contributes to a welcoming atmosphere. Our culinary journey included several dishes, with the standout being the calamari and mangu croquettes. The Chimi burger packed a flavorful punch, though the over-toasted bread was a letdown.

The drink selection consisted of standard mimosas accompanied by small carafes that serve about three glasses each. I'm curious to return for their signature cocktails. At $60 per person, including tax and gratuity, the price reflects the overall quality and experience.

The DJ effectively bridged the generational gap, playing early 2000s hits and transitioning to newer tracks, aligning perfectly with our group's age range.

For those in search of a lively group brunch setting with tasty food and a nostalgic soundtrack, I'd confidently recommend this Inwood gem.",1
20016,"GET THE GELATO. Tough deciding between 3-4 stars but gave it the benefit of the doubt because the gelato/cannolis were that good. Wait times between pizzas were long (30 minutes between each, ordered 2 pizzas), prices are expensive, and took 20-30 minutes to be seated for a reservation. Pizzas are definitely good, crust is doughy and delicious and ingredients are fresh but there's definitely equally as good places with less of a waitwith better prices. But damn, gelato was really good.",0
20641,"Upon my friend's recommendation, I ventured to an Eastern European restaurant with a hint of trepidation about finding dishes akin to my grandmother's pigs' feet gelatin. Thankfully, that fear was unfounded. I cannot stress enough: skip the gelatin.

The potato pancakes stole the show, transcending the ordinary breakfast hashbrowns to a blissful level of deliciousness. So good, in fact, I'd entertain the notion of a pancake-centric diet—at least within the confines of this gem.

Make sure to bring patience as a dining companion, though. A 20-minute wait for a table melded into a rather leisurely service, particularly when it came to receiving coffee—a misstep for the caffeine-dependent.

Brunch here is a decisive affair, with a no-substitution policy that demands commitment. I opted for the corned beef dumplings, a dish that delivered on flavor but didn't reach the euphoric heights of the pancakes, perhaps due to a potato mix. A notable absence was the sour cream, which I suspect was a minor oversight.

With an expansive menu and the luxury of being open 24/7, there's ample opportunity for future culinary exploration. And I plan to do just that.",1
16492,"I recently visited a bustling Japanese eatery that left a lasting impression. Despite the cozy seating and lively atmosphere, the stellar quality of food and wallet-friendly prices more than made up for any minor inconveniences. The no-tipping policy was a pleasant bonus.

The sukiyaki I savored was a highlight, showcasing an impressive presentation not often seen in such a high-energy kitchen. For starters, the chicken karaage was a crave-worthy choice, and the communal soybeans added a nice touch for casual snacking.

Service was efficient, although it required a proactive approach to catch a server's attention for additional orders or the check—a minor hiccup that some diners might find irksome.

My meal concluded with a matcha ice cream, which was decent, though slightly on the icy side. A smart detail was the chilled bowl, ensuring the dessert stayed perfectly cold until the last spoonful.

All things considered, I found the dining experience to be of exceptional value and I am eagerly looking forward to my next visit.",1
17733,"Title: Disappointing Experience at Mediocre Italian Eatery

I had high hopes for my dining experience based on the rave reviews I had read online, but I was met with disappointment. The service left much to be desired, with an incident involving our waiter improperly ""rounding"" our bill and pocketing the change without consent. This act of assuming a tip felt quite dishonest and directly impacted my view of the restaurant, leading to a 2-star rating.

As for the food, the spaghetti chitarra with ragu, priced at $15, was underwhelming and lacked the promised homemade touch. I didn't perceive any of the craftsmanship that typically comes with handcrafted pasta dishes. Similarly, the spinach pappardelle was overwhelming, smothered in an excessive cream sauce that detracted from the dish's potential and again did not seem homemade.

Overall, the combination of mediocre food that didn't live up to the advertising and questionable service practices means I cannot recommend this restaurant.",1
14810,"Title: A Stellar Brunch Experience with a Twist

I recently revisited a neighborhood gem from my 20s and was thrilled with the experience. The brunch offerings were extensive and delightful. Though I'm usually not one for margaritas, this place served up an exceptional, potent twist on the classic that was hard to resist and a pleasant surprise for a city brunch spot.

My husband enjoyed a hearty burger while I savored the perfectly cooked skirt steak accompanied by sunny side up eggs and sweet potato hash browns. Both dishes were cooked to perfection. We're already looking forward to our next visit to try the guacamole and tacos. And who knows, perhaps we'll get lucky and they'll have brought back the iconic Greg's Red Devil drink from the past. Can't wait to return!",1
16433,"College Gameday did me a favor 2 years ago by having their show in Times Square. They let me know that there is a restaurant/bar where Alabama alumni gather to watch Alabama games.  That place is The Ainsworth on 26th.When I entered, the first employee gave me a Roll Tide since I was wearing a Bama hat.  Now that's service I love! HahaI love the decor because there are approximately 35 TVs throughout the restaurant. This would be an excellent spot for me or any Alabama fan to watch any sporting event.  The hostess did say that the wildest time in the restaurant is when an Alabama football game is on haha.As for food, I chose the Mac and Cheese burger with a side of Ainsworth sauce.  The burger came with fries.  First of all, the mac and cheese was phenomenal! It was definitely homemade and I am guessing was made with cheddar cheese.  It was simply some of the best I have had.  That was one of the main reasons I chose the Mac and Cheese burger so I could end up with 2 sides instead of 1.  The burger was loaded with mac and cheese and had a fried mac and cheese patty.  It was also massive! I couldn't attack it without removing the patty. I enjoyed the Ainsworth sauce as it is a type of mayo-ketchup mix.  My burger was cooked the way I like it and had a fresh, chargrilled taste to it.However, the fries were disappointing. I hate to say but they were McDonald's fries.  They were hot, fresh, and crisp though.  I would expect better fries from a place like The Ainsworth. You could upgrade your fries to I think Garlic Parmesan. I would recommend me that unless you enjoy fast foos fries.I love the fact that they gave me a whole glass bottle of water.The Ainsworth does have steaks and other entrees.  They were just a little bit out of my budget.  But if you are looking for a place to watch sports with phenomenal mac and cheese and a solid burger, try The Ainsworth. And make sure you come on Alabama gameday and yell ""Roll Tide""!",0
1734,"Title: A Slice of Heaven in NYC

Review:

One word to describe my recent experience at this gem of a pizzeria: AMAZING. Despite a daunting queue, the wait was absolutely justified. I indulged in a slice of Sicilian-style pepperoni that was perfectly crispy, salty, and supported by a deliciously thick crust. The daily special, possibly named Goldstein, was an equally delectable cheesy delight.

A minor gripe is the limited seating—just a couple of tables outside and a standing shelf that's a tad too close to the oven's heat for comfort. Nevertheless, the pizza is simply explosive in flavor. In my books, it's probably the best pizza I've savored on this side of the Atlantic. I'm eagerly looking forward to my next NYC visit for another round!",1
15588,"This place is a diamond in the rough first heard about them after dining at BBQ's and finding out they are affiliated so that's a plus and both establishments have not dissatisfied me.  The wait staff was friendly, ambiance is definitely Irish Pub on a grand scale,  the food great, dessert awesome and Happy Hour though only until 7 is worth rushing out of work for! Can't wait til they open outside again to have a delicious meal from them  try it you won't be dissatisfied and if they are delivering order in",0
15626,"I had a delightful weekday lunch at this small, cozy restaurant that exudes a welcoming bar-like atmosphere. Seated immediately upon arrival, the establishment offered a tempting lunch special that included an appetizer, a choice of Thai iced coffee/tea or bottled water, and a main entree. I had the pleasure of trying the Cashew sauce and Ginger sauce entrees, both of which were fresh, flavorful, and thoroughly satisfying. The service was prompt with friendly, smiling faces contributing to the pleasant dining experience. Overall, it was a good meal that left me content and looking forward to returning.",1

16056,"Recently, I had the opportunity to visit a charming French bakery before heading to the theater, and I must say, it was quite a delightful experience. The decor of the place was refreshingly clean and offered a spaciousness that is a rarity in Manhattan.

The menu was straightforward, focusing on classic French bakery items, aromatic coffee, and a selection of sandwiches crafted with freshly baked bread that added a touch of authenticity. While the organization of the bakery was unconventional, featuring a line to a cashier without a clear menu to order from, it did add to the unique character of the place, though it may be slightly confusing for first-timers.

The coffee deserves a special mention—it was excellent and certainly a highlight that comes highly recommended. As for the cost, it was slightly upscale, but keeping in mind the location, it seemed justifiable.

In summary, if you're looking for a taste of France in the heart of New York and don't mind paying a little extra for the experience, this bakery is worth a stop.",1

If you're looking for a dining experience in New York City that consistently impresses, look no further. This gem of a restaurant is a favorite of mine for good reason.

10176,"Celebrating a friend's birthday at this vibrant Mexican restaurant turned out to be a fantastic choice, thanks to its bright and upbeat ambiance. With our large group, we skipped the hassle of a reservation on a weeknight and dove straight into the festivity with a pitcher of margarita – a decent deal despite the limited flavor options.

We nibbled on a tasty, though slightly small, serving of classic guacamole, quickly requiring a second round of chips. The main event was an assortment of tacos; my choice of Baja fish tacos did not disappoint, and the general consensus around the table was one of satisfaction.

The birthday celebration was sweetened with a delightful ice cream sundae, complete with all the classic toppings and indulgent brownie bites. This lively spot proved its worth, offering good food, enjoyable drinks, and a great atmosphere suitable for large groups. Definitely recommended!",1
1360,Great healthy eats if you want something quick. I got several of my meal pal orders and enjoyed it. There were broccolini with lemon potatoes and a roasted chicken. It looks like there are other healthy options and fresh ingredients.,0
20307,"Title: Disappointing Experience at a Classic Eatery

My visit to this restaurant left much to be desired both in atmosphere and food/service, with an overall rating of 2.5/5. Upon entry, I was met with a nostalgic ambiance, which quickly lost its charm due to the dire need for renovations. The unsettling, creaky floors detracted further from the experience.

Service-wise, the staff was alarmingly slow. Patiently awaiting basics like coffee and water refills became an unintended test of my patience. Culinary-wise, the chicken in their signature chicken and waffles dish was parched and bland, failing to live up to the expectations of a soul food establishment. Moreover, the steep prices were unjustifiable, given the subpar quality and service. In summary, this restaurant could benefit greatly from some refurbishment and a sharper focus on food quality and customer service.",1
1963,"So many words come to mind when I think about my meal at Salinas. From the minute you step inside, you are greeted by a smiling face and beautiful imported Ecuadorian roses. The restaurant is thoughtfully laid out with a hallway near the entrance, which decreased foot traffic and noise and gives diners near the front of the restaurant a better experience.We were seated in the back dining room, which was perfectly intimate. Seated along the wall in the dimly light dining room, I noticed there were small lights directly over our table shining directly in front of each diner, to aid in reading of the menu and to see our food in all its glory. The attention to detail here is, as you can probably already guess, phenomenal.Service was equally delightful. All the waitstaff were professional and friendly, attentive but not overbearing. At one point, I got up from my table to use the restroom. A gentleman who might've been the manager asked if he could help with anything, and then walked me all the way there (in the front hallway). Seriously, the staff here treat you like royalty.Now on to the food and drink. We had a few cocktails, the La Lupita and the El Club Del Desayuno, both of which were refreshing and mixed well. For food, we had 6 tapas; my favorites were the scallop and steak skewer (a special menu item) and a lamb shank dish served in a martini glass with a side of fried wonton skin. The serrano ham, machego cheese, and mussels special were also really tasty. Ironically, the very popular popcorn-crusted octopus dish didn't wow me; I found the sauce to be too salty and the popcorn didn't do anything for me. And finally, the Fideos Negros (squid ink vermicelli) was nice and creamy, but stained your lips and teeth.All in all, I absolutely adored Salinas, and will definitely be back for another delightful meal!",0
16002,"The restaurant is located in the basement and I passed by it a few times before realizing it was downstairs. I ordered two chicken tacos ($3.75 each) for lunch (but, really three would have been more satisfying). The small but, the cute restaurant was empty when I came to pick up my order. However, the server was very nice. I love that the tacos came with huge chunks of meat and was flavorful but, a bit dry (especially when you bit into a big chunk of meat -- also be careful of bones. One taco, had a piece). They did offer hot sauces when I came to pick up - mild, medium, and hot (habanero sauce, very similar to Dos Toros ""hot"" sauce option). I chose ""hot"" which gave it a kick but, it was still a bit dry. I would also like to point out that because the tacos had a ton of filling (which I love) they should really double up on the tortilla because it got so soggy and when I lifted the taco up, it broke apart. Thankfully, they included a fork so I can pick up everything. I will definitely try to come during their brunch (all you can eat + all you can drink) or happy hour (3 tacos and drink for $14) because they have really reasonable deals.",0
19416,"La familia y yo or yo y familia (I have a new Espanol app hahaha) had meatballs, fresh salad and pizza. I'm not a lover of Italian food but their food was very delicious! My apologies, this is another occasion where I'm not allowed to take pics of my food because of the family rule. They're saying they cannot take me anywhere or some chit like that. Who are these people? I think folks who don't yelp OR take pics of their food should be ""rewarded"" with a straight-jacket 24 hr experience.

I can't remember the name of the drink I got but it has Prosecco and amaretto and was so so so delicious. The staff was so nice and welcoming! They were so friendly, which you hear the New York stereotypes so we were extremely pleased. We sat by the window and it was a wonderful people watching spot.",0

13812,"My friend and I came here on a cold winter night. The restaurant is very spacious and cleaner than other Vietnamese restaurants that I've been to in the city. The decor is cute. The menu is packed with options. The employees are attentive and friendly. This definitely seems to be a family-run restaurant. While the pho may be on the higher end price wise, there was definitely a fresher taste and better portion size in terms of vermicelli - compared to the pho in other restaurants. I ordered #91. Pho Saigon (original) and he ordered #94. Pho Tai Nam. In my bowl, I felt the meat components was less than I expected in terms of portions. Maybe, add more meat. The broth was incredibly fresh and clear which is not something that occurs often. When I added the jalapenos into my soup, it made my soup very spicy, which just shows how clean the broth was. If it was overpowered by MSG, then the jalapenos would not have had an effect. Would I come back? Definitely. Very great pho.",0
12745,"Yum! I live right around the block from this place and after passing it almost daily for my work commute I finally decided to give it a try. And oh man am I happy that I did. These gnocchis may have been the most delicious gnocchi I've ever had. Not too dense or gummy, perfectly soft. Just amazing pillow-y goodness, soft enough to rest your head on. And the sauces! My date and I had the tricolor gnocchi for 2... and it's impossible to decide which sauce I loved the most. The pesto was flavorful without being over powering, and the tomato sauce had a bright fresh flavor to it. We also shared the Mista salad - perfect amount of dressing and goat cheese. And the tartufo for dessert, which I've never had before and reminded me of a giant bon bon. Also, split a bottle of the house red, which the owner informed us changes every month (as if you need another reason to come back). Seriously salivating while writing this review. I guess if you don't like gnocchi don't come here, but what kind of life are you leading if you don't love potato pillow explosions in your mouth?",0
11182,"My dad and I came to Hometown Dumpling and had a great time! It was surprisingly busy for a weekday lunch, but the owner of the restaurant was greeting everyone and walking around talking to and helping all of the diners along with the waiter. The owner told us that their home recipes were from her grandmother!We started with a generous portion of complimentary japchae noodles with vegetables. Then, we ordered a beef bibimbap and the shrimp dumplings lunch specials. As she and the waiter were bringing out our dishes, the owner asked us whether we were planning on sharing (which we were), and she brought out new dishes for us to use.The bibimbap came as a large bowl of beef with vegetables (bean sprouts, mushrooms, sliced carrots, some sort of spiralized vegetable, beef, fresh cucumbers, cucumber salad, and spinach) and a sunny-side-up egg with gochujang and a bowl of rice for each of us on the side. The dumplings were served with potatoes and a salad and came with soy sauce, and then furthermore, we received cucumber salad, kimchi, pickled cabbage. It was a really nice spread of refreshing food that was tasty but not too heavy--perfect for a hot day! (Next time, I might get the shrimp dumplings steamed rather than fried because the filling is flavorful enough that they probably don't need an oil-fried exterior to be delicious.) The portions were so generous that we wound up taking a bunch of food home, and our waiter packaged everything up separately and neatly for us.We actually came to Hometown Dumpling to scope it out as a potential place to get food to bring to my grandparents, and it definitely passed the test. I would recommend this place for a tasty, (reasonably) healthy meal--just come hungry or be prepared to save leftovers! :)",0
13950,"Stopped in today and sat at the counter. It was busy, and customers just kept showing up. My girlfriend and I ordered a green tea lemonade and a large bowl of raw beef pho. (Not as appetizing sounding as ""rare steak,"" but same concept.)The pho here is fashioned after the northern Vietnamese style (think Hanoi). Supposedly, Just Pho is the only restaurant in Manhattan specializing in this particular regional cuisine. The broth is different from southern Vietnamese pho, and the noodles are wider. That's about as far as my knowledge extends. Service was fast. Soon, my girlfriend and I were taking turns slurping noodles and chewing through delicious, tender beef. We requested extra cilantro: power move. Typically, I don't add anything extra to my pho broth, but today I tried some of the spicy pho sauce, and it was sooo gooooood. They're offering 25% off for opening month, so visit ASAP! Location is on West 31st Street by 8th Avenue, across from Penn Station. Convenient for people traveling through the area or working/living nearby. If you're a fan of northern Vietnamese pho, don't wait.",0
16749,"Title: A Yakitori Gem Worthy of All 5's

My experience at this new yakitori spot was nothing short of exceptional, earning a well-deserved 5 out of 5 across the board for food, value, service, and décor. I ventured in at 7:30 pm and was fortunate to land the last two bar seats, giving us a front-row show to the culinary spectacle.

The ambiance struck a perfect balance of beauty and tranquility, contributing to the overall zen vibe. Watching dishes like yakitori and yakisoba noodles being expertly prepared before our eyes was not only entertaining but gave us great ideas for future visits.

Our server, Scott, was the epitome of kindness and efficiency. My boyfriend and I delved into a feast of various yakitori, from teba wing to pork jowl and enoki wrapped in pork belly, along with perfectly grilled vegetables and flavorful yakisoba that rivaled my experiences in Japan.

Every dish was a hit, cooked to perfection with impeccable seasoning that highlighted the fresh, high-quality ingredients. It's hard to pick favorites, but the enoki wrapped in pork belly and the thigh with yuzukosho were standouts.

I wholeheartedly recommend this spot for a date night, and I am already planning a return visit to explore more of their menu. If you're a fan of authentic yakitori and exceptional service, this place is a must-try.",1
20739,"6/5 for the MIGHTY SAUCE. whatever they put in that is so so so flavorful and probably the most flavorful ""Cajun/garlic/lemon"" mash up I've ever tried. Highly recommend getting medium or spicy--the spicy makes ur lips tingle but well worth the flavor. I usually never eat corn but I ate it because I didn't have anything else to scoop the sauce with.Aside from that, seafood was great! I only wish the shrimp (headless) was taken off the fire sooner-a bit overcooked but honestly didn't mind cause the sauce was that good.We werent going to order any appetizers but they recommended their bang bang shrimp and I can see why! If you're going to get any apps be sure to get those. They had the perfect crispy texture.This place gives you gloves (yes!!), wipes (yes!!!) and a bib :)",0
19228,"I recently dined at this delightful eatery and was thoroughly impressed by the experience. I opted for fried pierogis, straying from the traditional boiled preparation, and they didn't disappoint – crispy on the outside and utterly delicious. A serving of six proved to be surprisingly satisfying, leaving me feeling comfortably full. The place does draw a crowd, so a brief wait is possible, but the ample seating ensures that you'll be dining in no time. Overall, a fun and tasty spot that's well worth a visit!",1
2161,"This is my second visit to Creamline, and it was an great one! Though I can't speak to their food, it seems as though the rest of the customers were enjoying it! I had their two cookies milkshake-- it was very, very good. The milkshake itself is light and airy, in a way. It had nice chunks of Oreo cookies, rather than just blended crumbles. The customer service has improved since my last visit a few months ago, which speaks to the quality of business run here. This is a company that is willing to listen to its patrons and provide delicious food/drink with a great environment. I was told that the milk used for the milk and whipped cream is locally farm sourced, which is great to hear! Thank you Creamline.",0
20887,"Nestled in the bustling streets of Brooklyn, I've given this local pizzeria a handful of chances, drawn by sheer proximity rather than culinary quest. On my last jaunt a couple of nights back, I opted for the grandma slice—a decent $4 venture. The crust, carrying a peculiar translucence, lends an almost chewy texture that sets it apart. Not quite the epitome of my pizza palate, it's definitely above average—think higher than Artichoke but shy of reaching the upper crust of my pizza hierarchy. If convenience calls or a pizza whim strikes, this spot will suffice to satisfy the craving.",1
11013,"Farm to Burger! With a name like that you have to try one of their beef entrees.I came on a random Sunday afternoon in January and was just one of a few tables at the time. The service was good, the food was better. I had their Mac and Cheese offering (very filling) and their steak entree. The steak was made perfectly. Very juicy (medium) seasoned well. It was accompanied by roasted vegetables and an au jus. For 31, I think it was a fair price for quality meat in the heart of Hell's Kitchen.I didn't get a chance to try any of their cocktails, but I certainly want to go back and try one of their boozy milkshakes (thanks Pulp Fiction). The place makes for a nice date night or quiet get together. The only negative is that getting to the bathroom requires some work.

17333,"Title: A Gem for Curry Lovers in Ktown: Abiko

Abiko quickly climbed to the top of my Ktown favorites list for its irresistible curry dishes. A word to the wise—arrive before peak hours as they only seat complete parties and the place fills up fast.

The thoughtful design includes a tray under each table, conveniently housing utensils and napkins, making everything you need readily accessible without vying for a waiter's attention.

The menu shines with a variety of luscious curry offerings, both with noodles and rice, plus a plethora of customizable toppings to enhance your meal. Standouts for me are the scrumptious fried chicken donburi and the perfectly balanced curry udon with a side of crispy fried pork cutlet. The curry sauce is a standout, offering customizable spice levels (although a word of caution: level 2 spice is plenty hot for most).

Fair pricing for the quality and location make Abiko an easy recommendation for anyone seeking a filling and flavorful meal in Ktown.",1

12128,"Title: Serene Lunch Spot with Quality Eats

On a tranquil Tuesday, we ventured into a delightful restaurant on the hotel's first floor. Welcomed by high ceilings and charming decor, the place offered an unexpectedly peaceful dining experience, with hardly any other patrons besides us. This, coupled with speedy service, makes it an ideal spot for a lunch meeting.

While the recent menu change has axed the Kobe beef burger, a former favorite, the restaurant still serves up a commendable burger experience. I opted for ""The Box,"" a well-priced lunch combo at $19, plus a $3 upcharge for a larger 8oz patty, accompanied by a choice of soup or salad and fries. The ""New York"" burger, though it fell short of extraordinary, was a solid choice with its juicy patty and generous bacon. The clam chowder was a highlight, rich in flavor and brimming with tender clam pieces.

Regrettably, I missed the chance to try their boozy milkshake, but it's a perfect excuse to return. If you’re in search of a quiet and quick lunch option, this place is definitely worth the recommendation.",1
20941,This was quite an experience!   I was here many years ago and had no memory of my last visit.  First the food.  I had the Roumanian steak. It was ok.

16670,"I recently visited a local restaurant during lunch and was surprised to find it empty, despite the fantastic experience my family and I had. We opted for the lunch combo box, priced at an affordable $12, which I found to be exceptional value. The box was generously filled with a variety of items, including rice, delectable dumplings, a California roll, soup or salad, and a choice of meat - my chicken katsu was notably crunchy yet tender.

Not only did the California roll seem freshly made, but it was also a full portion, not the mere two or three pieces one might expect. The combo was so substantial that I was nearly unable to finish it, which speaks volumes about the quantity and quality provided for the price.

The restaurant's ambiance added to the enjoyment, with an interior that exuded a relaxing atmosphere. Plus, its location is quite pleasant, situated across from a delightful candy shop, perfect for a sweet treat post-meal. My experience was so positive that I am certain of my return to this hidden gem.",1
17613,"Title: A Pleasurable Italian Feast with Room for Improvement

My recent visit to this Italian gem was a delightful experience. The service was impeccable, deserving of the highest praise, and the food certainly did not disappoint, with a solid A rating.

While the pizza didn't quite hit the mark for me, leaning towards a thicker crust rather than the traditional Neapolitan style I anticipated, it might simply be their unique take on the dish. This was a minor hiccup in authenticity but not enough to overshadow the culinary journey.

The pasta dishes were the stars of the main course, cooked to perfection and bursting with flavor. As for the dessert, both the crème brûlée and the brownie with ice cream were sublime, not to be missed.

On the downside, our request for bread was met with a disappointingly stale offering. However, the bruschetta came with bread that was impeccable in its freshness and taste. The artichoke appetizer was a standout, despite the slight challenge it posed to our dining etiquette.

The drink selection won us over with their homemade sangria and an array of well-crafted cocktails, including a notable Manhattan and a refreshing limoncello-based concoction.

It's worth mentioning that the restaurant's approach to attracting patrons felt a touch desperate, with someone outside trying to lure customers in. This practice hardly seems necessary given the overall quality of the dining experience.

In conclusion, this Italian spot is a solid choice for anyone in the area seeking a safe bet for a delightful meal. With just a bit of fine-tuning, they could easily transform from good to extraordinary.",1
3261,"Title: A Friday Evening at the Open-Air Eatery: Hits and Misses

I recently dined at this restaurant on a mild Friday evening at 6pm, walking into a surprisingly uncrowded space. The open seating area was particularly inviting, promising a delightful dining experience on pleasant weather days.

To my delight, the establishment offered a generous happy hour deal: with every beer purchased, we received a complimentary skewer. The spicy cumin chicken and lemongrass pork skewers were the highlights of the night, bursting with flavor and leaving a lasting impression.

The dishes arrived in succession, and my palate embarked on a journey of varied tastes. At the forefront was the Beef Pad See Ew, which presented a harmonious blend of spices and the coveted 'wok hei' — though I found myself wishing for more tender slices of beef.

The Thai wings, served spicy, were a delectable treat with their perfectly crisp skin and succulent meat. However, be warned: the heat is not for the faint-hearted. Those preferring a milder kick should opt for the classic sauce.

As we delved further into the menu, the Oyster Pancake fell flat, relying heavily on its accompanying sauce for flavor. Following closely behind was the Crispy Pork Belly, an overly oily dish that bordered on an uncanny resemblance to Chicharrón, much to my dismay.

The most disappointing dish of the evening was, regrettably, the Ribeye Steak. A laborious chew through a tough cut, accompanied by an unfitting dipping sauce and an unfortunately hard and non-sticky 'sticky rice,' left me less than impressed.

In conclusion, whilst the happy hour specials would tempt me to return, the entrees I sampled were predominantly a letdown. A mixed bag of an experience, this restaurant shines in its ambiance and select offerings but has room to improve in culinary execution.",1

Making my way to the heart of Korea Town, my expectations were set high thanks to the local buzz surrounding this second-floor eatery, known for its late-night hours catering to post-show diners. Arriving at the convenient time of 9:45 PM, I anticipated a warm welcome; instead, I encountered an initial lack of attention requiring a bit of effort on my part to flag down the staff.

Once recognized, a friendly hostess promptly seated us within five minutes, and a server was quick to suggest drinks before taking our order. The food, however, was somewhat disappointing—modest banchan and a decent selection of meats were served alongside unique grills, yet the overall taste didn't quite hit the mark.

Service was the low point of the evening, marred by a noticeable delay, especially when it came to the simple request for a side of rice, which took multiple attempts and the completion of an entree before it was finally served. Our server's lack of engagement and soft-spoken demeanor only contributed to the disconnect, although the bussers did provide a friendly counterbalance.

Unfortunately, despite its potential and convenience, I find myself disinclined to return.",1

The freshness of the oyster and shrimp was commendable, and the variety of four sauces offered a welcome opportunity for customization. However, the Uni Pasta failed to impress as the sauce was disappointingly watery, detracting from what could have been a delightful dish.

2330,"Title: Missed the Mark in Washington Heights

My experience at this Dominican restaurant left much to be desired. As someone with Dominican roots, I was disheartened to find that the traditional dishes I know and love lacked authenticity in flavor. The mofongos were disappointingly dry and bland, and the sancocho didn't fare much better. 

On the positive side, the portions were generous, and they didn't hesitate to serve a whole avocado as a side – a nice touch. However, with the abundance of Dominican eateries in Washington Heights, this place does not stand out. The decision not to serve mangu past 11am is baffling, and the inflexible meal combinations that led to excessive food and cost were frustrating. Pricing felt steep, shelling out $75 for three without indulging in beverages.

Moreover, the service was lackluster, which did nothing to enhance our dining experience. Overall, this establishment could do with a revisit of what makes Dominican cuisine so vibrant and inviting. I'd reluctantly rate it a 3.5 if I could, but it's a hesitant endorsement at best.",1
13622,"If there ever was a culinary temptation worthy of scriptural warning, this restaurant embodies it. With a menu that makes even the most stoic foodie's mouth water in envy, it's a place where the commandment against coveting is put to the test. From the sublime dim sum dumplings to the irresistible scallion pancakes, every dish is a revelation of flavor. And while I've yet to savor the spring rolls, there's no doubt in my mind that a return visit is non-negotiable. This eatery isn't just recommended; it's a must-visit for anyone who cherishes exceptional cuisine.",1
18058,"Title: Uneven Service, but Tasty Food at Local Favorite

I recently revisited a restaurant I hadn't been to in some time, eager to see if the dinner experience held up to my fond memories. Opting for the Bibimbap dinner combo and a side of seafood tofu soup, I was looking forward to a warming, satisfying meal.

While the food remained as delicious as I remembered, the service unfortunately did not match up. Banchan, the traditional spread of Korean side dishes, typically arrives shortly after ordering, whetting the appetite and setting the stage for the main course. However, this time around, the service stumbled as our banchan was tardily served alongside our main dishes, contrary to the prompt service at neighboring tables.

The lapse in service was notable enough to mar the dining experience, overshadowing the otherwise enjoyable meal. As such, I find myself compelled to rate this visit at 2 stars. The saving grace was the quality and taste of the food, without which the rating would have plunged to a single star based solely on the service shortcomings.",1
10920,"The atmosphere at Raku is great with the nice lighting, wooden tables, and most notably, a very clean environment. I went on a Saturday night where the wait was only 5 min around 8pm, but I'd say it's safer to go early if you can to avoid any wait.As for the food, I got the fried chicken karaage and the niku udon. The karaage serves as a great appetizer, as it was still piping hot when it came out. The chicken was juicy and crisp and, just the way I like it. Squeezing some lemon juice on top and dipping it into the spicy mayo provided, the chicken sated my appetite for a bit before the main course. If you need to pick an appetizer and love fried chicken, the karaage here is easily some of the best I've had.As for the niku udon, I chose the dish, as I saw that it had rave reviews. At first glance, the dish doesn't look like much, but looks can be deceiving. The udon was actually pretty good, as the beef broth was hearty and full of umami. However, the actual dish itself felt a bit disappointing, as though there was good flavor, there didn't seem to be a lot of meat itself in the dish. The ribs were tender enough to fall off the bone and the tripe was solid, but overall, the dish didn't seem to be something special. Overall, Raku is definitely worth a try for their fried chicken and though I was a bit disappointed with their niku udon, their other selections look appetizing enough for me to give it another try when given the chance.",0

12789,"Came by on a saturday afternoon, a little late around 2 so it was pretty empty. We tried:- tagliatelle with carbonara 9/10: i really enjoyed this dish because it was exactly the level of creaminess i was looking for. The little pancetta pieces were there but not significant. Tagliatelle was also good and had a slightly undercooked taste which i love. - squid ink pasta 7/10: tho i normally love squid ink anything, this was just mediocre at best. The dish didn't really taste like anything and we ended up pooring a bunch of parmesan and pepper flakes on it to make it taste like SOMETHING. Although the food was great, the only reason i took down a star from the otherwise 4-star experience is that the service was AWFUL. And i'd like to add that i usually don't even care about service but the food took so awfully long to come out, we were on the verge of leaving. We ended up waiting over 30 minutes for our food when the restaurant wasn't even busy, nor had we ordered other things to busy ourselves with. It seemed that other people had the same issue as well, and we even saw one family leave because it took too long. I'm not sure if this is just a one time occurrence or if it is common but if is the former, they really need to hire extra staff because such a long wait is not worth it, especially when there are a plethora of other great pasta places - not to mention in that area alone.",0
19212,"Title: A Hidden Gem on the Upper East Side: Pig Heaven Review

As a resident of the Upper East Side, it's been a challenge to find authentic Chinese cuisine in the neighborhood. However, Pig Heaven has proven to be a delightful exception. Nestled just blocks away from my home, my Saturday lunch experience here, starting with a prompt seating at noon due to a well-planned reservation and a restaurant that was welcoming yet not overcrowded, set the stage for a memorable meal.

Ambience:
Pig Heaven offers a low-key and quiet atmosphere, with an intriguing pig-themed decor towards the back that adds character to the restaurant's casual vibe. It seems to attract a more mature clientele from the UES, making it a comfortable spot for a relaxed dining experience.

Menu Highlights:
The culinary journey began with the mouthwatering chili chicken (口水雞), featuring the perfect balance of Sichuan peppercorns and spice that was enthralling but not overwhelming. The addition of peanuts offered a satisfying crunch. The portion size was substantial, ensuring a hearty experience.

At the recommendation of the owner, Lisa M., we tried the spare ribs (排骨). Infused with a Cantonese twist, the ribs were a standout - succulent, tender, and enrobed in a delectable Cha siu sauce that complemented the meat's natural juices. A crispy crust added texture, making it evident why this dish is a star on their menu.

The hotpot fish (火鍋魚) erased any initial concerns of being overly oily and was a testament to the kitchen's prowess. The fish was fresh, well-balanced with cabbage, and the celery contributed a welcomed crisp. The spice level was admirable, though an option to customize it would be a welcomed addition for those who crave an extra kick.

Service:
Exceptional service accentuated our dining encounter. The wait staff was attentive and amiable, while Lisa's hospitality rendered our visit particularly enjoyable. Learning about the restaurant's history and future culinary ambitions was both enlightening and a testament to her entrepreneurial spirit.

Overall:
Pig Heaven has earned a new regular with its authentic dishes, exceptional service, and inspiring management. Whether you're from the Upper East Side or visiting the area, this restaurant is a must-try for anyone looking for genuine Chinese cuisine in an inviting setting.",1
19282,"During my weekend visit to NYC, I was eager to dine at this much-talked-about restaurant, and it didn't disappoint. Joined by two friends for lunch, I indulged in the Pork ""Zha Jiang"" Hand-Ripped Noodles, which were impeccable, not only in texture but also in the sublime taste of the Zha Jiang sauce. Additionally, the Spicy cumin lamb burger was a burst of rich flavors that left a lasting impression. The service here was just as impressive as the food—warm and hospitable. This restaurant is a must-visit for anyone craving a memorable dining experience in the city. Highly recommended!",1
288,"Eclectic menu and decor makes an interesting stop for a weeknight dinner. Place is intimate with bar seating and 3 tables along the wall with a bench filled with cute pillows. The decor ranges from TJ's succulents and homy art deco. We started with a vegan roasted butternut squash soup ($5), which came with coconut cream on top and was my favorite. The smooth texture and flavor was just right.The crab cake sliders ($14) are a bit small but tasted natural without too much sauce. Wish portions were a bit larger.The soy braised pork belly was saucy but crispy and had to be paired with rice or else would be too rich. The thai beef salad was well sautéed but a bit too spicy and slightly tough to chew for me. Overall a comfort fusion food style. Italian mascapone cheesecake is a great way to end the meal, every bite paired well with the fruits and didn't feel too rich.",0

10506,"Ordered from here for the first time tonight and overall I'm pretty pleased. I give Dough Boys Pizza a 3.5 rating but always round up instead of down on Yelp to give the business the benefit of the doubt. Ordered a plain slice ($3), Margerita ($4) and the prosciutto arugula slice ($4.50) for delivery. PROS: Love the surprise of toasted sesame seeds on the crust of the plain slice! Wasn't expecting this but the flavor is nice, nutty and adds a little something special to the slice! Margherita slice had a silky smooth flavorful tomato sauce that I really enjoyed. Delivery was also lightning fast. CONS: The San Daniele slice was actually horrific. The arugula was ruined: burned and wilted (all photos show the arugula crisp, fresh and not cooked at all). Whoever heated up this slice did so with the arugula still on it which burned it and made the little prosciutto slices into complete inedible RUBBER. The cheese on this was also rock hard/burned into the dough as per my photo of it. **Please consider removing the arugula and prosciutto before delivering it by setting it aside.** I threw the slice away after two bites.But 2/3 slices were great so hence my overall positive review.",0
3269,"Stepping into Antalia is a treat in itself, with wagon-wheeled seating adding a touch of whimsy to the welcoming ambiance. The staff, led by the commendable Sergio, couldn't be more attentive. Smiles abound, service is eager and knowledgeable, and every question about the Turkish menu is met with a detailed explanation.

Despite its lunchtime buzz, the atmosphere remains light and airy, complemented by charming off-white wooden tables. The chicken soup, reminiscent of home cooking, is a heartwarming starter, served with irresistibly soft Turkish bread. The accompanying Mezzes platter, with its standout pink sultan—a sweet beet concoction—is not to be missed.

The beef and lamb Adana, a crowd favorite, doesn't disappoint either, with its well-done, flavorful meat. Dessert brings a sweet conclusion in the form of light, fluffy baklava, perfectly paired with visually impressive Turkish tea.

Antalia offers an authentic array of Turkish and Mediterranean dishes, with a varied selection of meats, salads, and seafood. A delightful dining experience that shines in both cuisine and service.",1
2241,"I regret to say that my experience at this ramen spot was disappointing. Despite an inviting ambiance, the ramen itself fell flat. The noodles lacked any discernible taste, and the broth was notably watery, lacking the rich depth one expects from a hearty bowl of ramen. While the portions of pork were generous, the quality didn't meet expectations. To add insult to injury, the price point didn't reflect the lackluster quality of the meal, and even the tap water was unpalatable. I cannot recommend this establishment; diners in search of authentic and flavorful ramen should look elsewhere.",1
12807,"Title: Tasty Eats with Efficient Service

I recently dined at a local spot where the service stood out as both friendly and fast, ensuring a pleasant meal. The food was tasty across the board, with prices that didn't break the bank. I was also impressed by the cleanliness of the restroom facilities, which is always a good indicator of overall restaurant hygiene.

A standout dish was the samosas; they were simply delicious and are a must-try according to my palate. Additionally, the aloo cauliflower and potato dish (whose name escapes me) was very satisfying. While nothing ventured into the realm of extraordinary, everything served was solidly good.

I would recommend this restaurant to those looking for a reliably enjoyable meal in a welcoming atmosphere.",1
21086,"It's definitely a hole in the wall. And after The NY Times raves, I was hoping for perfection. But alas it's just a slice place. Not bad and certainly hit the spot. Gotta go for the pepperoni.  I like the meat and there's certainly plenty on it.",0
20188,"I think I like the menu at the Chelsea location better, but I still had a great meal here. (Also like that they give you a bread basket!)

11548,"Quality food, modern vibe, cool & cozy space ... great UWS addition!Packed at brunch time for our first visit, we were warmly welcomed and our group of 6 got a glimpse of lots of dishes.

12955,"I visited this eatery recently for a late-night bite with a friend, opting to order a pie online for pickup. Despite our pre-order, upon arrival, the pie wasn't ready, resulting in an uncomfortably long wait that seemed quite unnecessary for a simple pizza. In hindsight, a slice may have been a quicker choice. Upon finally receiving our order, we took it home, only to find the pizza, adorned with the trendy but not particularly impressive tiny pepperonis, to be decent but not exceptional. It didn't live up to the quality one expects from a Sicilian pie. Overall, the establishment seems to ride on Millennial appeal rather than culinary excellence.",1
10288,"Tucked away in KoreaTown, BARO proved to be a gem with its extensive happy hour selection that extends beyond traditional Korean fare to include comfort foods like chicken wings and mozzarella sticks. However, our culinary adventure steered us towards the main menu, where we indulged in the flavorful dupbap—a delightful twist on bibimbap featuring a medley of rice, crab, and a protein of choice (salmon for me). Each component boasted freshness, a vital aspect when it comes to seafood, especially in the heart of Manhattan. Service was notably swift and accompanied by the warmth of our waitress. The ambiance struck a perfect balance of intimacy and casualness, with dim lighting and music at just the right volume to foster easy conversation. All in all, BARO delivered on food, service, and atmosphere, making it a worthwhile visit.",1
13995,"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused many local restaurants to close shop, leaving me tired of alternating chick-fil-a and chipotle.

I was intrigued to find they have an entire page of menu items dedicated to indochinese food. I tried out the dry chili chicken and the chicken tikka masala. My girlfriend had the eggplant and yellow lentils. The chicken tikka was everything I was hoping for: warm, creamy, and aromatic. The dry chili chicken was interesting- it had the spices of an indian dish but the texture and flavor finish of takeout chinese food. My gf really enjoyed the flavor and the heartiness of the eggplant. We also got an order of samosas which had surprisingly crispy chew dough. Nom. Total came to be $60 which was quite reasonable for the quality and quantity. Looking to try a lunch special next time!",0
14659,"Title: Hit and Miss at Morton's

During a recent visit to Morton's with friends, we sampled a range of dishes from starters to dessert. Despite the well-executed presentation and generous portions, the overall experience failed to justify the upscale pricing.

The Morton salad was a simple lettuce and egg white combination that lacked innovation. Although my companion enjoyed their lobster bisque, I abstained and thus can't comment on it. The onion soup was on the saltier side for my taste.

Main courses featured salmon and filet mignon. The salmon's exterior had a promising crust and glaze, yet it seemed improperly thawed and undercooked internally. The filet mignon, ordered medium well, attained only an average status and had a slightly tougher texture than expected, not living up to the steakhouse standards.

On the upside, the side dishes of mashed potatoes, creamed spinach, and macaroni were satisfactory but not exceptional, as they are dishes easily replicated at home.

Desserts proved to be a mixed bag. The ""legendary"" hot chocolate cake stood out positively, though it was let down by accompanying ice cream that bore signs of freezer burn. The double chocolate mousse was overwhelmingly sweet, verging on the inedible after a few bites.

While the ambiance and service, especially from our server Matt, were highlights of the evening, the culinary aspect left much to be desired. In summary, Morton’s delivers an average experience at a premium price, and could benefit from a more innovative chef. The ambiance and service, however, may still make it worth a visit for some.",1
14245,"Pretty ok place.Went to Lido after stopping by Amy Ruth's, where the wait time was a bit long. There's several things to like about Lido, but ultimately nothing terribly unique.Lido looks very much like your typical hipster brunch place. They've got the usual brunch offerings, the bottomless alcohol, the bustling crowd. Decor is nice with several various seating arrangements. You've got your bar tops, high tops, booths, and tables. Seems like there's something for everyone, but if you come with a party, I'd expect to wait a while. Things are pretty close together, so you're the type that likes a bit of real estate, this won't be the place for you. Staff was friendly, even though it was exceptionally busy, and the bathrooms were impressively clean.I wasn't feeling anything fancy for brunch, so I went with the eggs, bacon, and biscuit. It's pretty standard stuff you could make at home, but fancy brunch places always have a way of elevating it. Lido did not elevate it. You'll get a healthy portion of bacon, but the eggs were your standard quick order eggs and were unseasoned. That's not too big a deal since everyone likes a different amount of salt on their eggs. The biscuit was a miss for me, being tough and crumbly. Bacon is bacon, so it's always going to be good, but again, just quick order kitchen stuff. I ordered a latte to go along with the food, which was severed closer to a cappuccino than a latte. I will say though that it tasted great, but not exactly what I ordered.If I lived in the area, I'd for sure go again to see if they do the fancy stuff better, but can't see myself returning.",0
10751,"I was just walking past this place with my girlfriend when an enthusiastic man waved at us from inside this pizza shop.  Had no plan on stopping because we already had lunch plans at the French place next door, but I figured I might as well, as my GF has never had a taste of authentic NY pizza before.  Greg, the owner, greeted us warmly.  He treated us like VIPs.  Explaining to us about how their Margherita pizza was featured on the Food Network and won all sorts of praise.  After that, I was sold.  I really try to stay away from bread but this seemed worth it.  We ordered a slice of the BBQ pizza and the Margherita pizza and agreed to share.  Both were outstanding.  Exactly what I could want from a NY pizza.  They were perfectly crispy on the bottom, but not burnt at all.  The right amount of cheese-to-sauce ratio as well.  All the ingredients tasted very fresh.  Tbh it almost tasted coal-fired it was so good, but I don't think I  saw a coal-fired oven anywhere.  I can always tell if a pizza is good by if I'm so enamored with it that I eat the crust as well.  I ended up eating everything.  My girlfriend was really happy with it too.  She said it was the best pizza she's had in her life.  Greg was even nice enough to take a photo of us two at our table.  He really made the whole thing an experience for us.  I can tell he loves what he does and is very proud of the pizza he serves, as he should be.  Very happy to have stopped in at Bleecker Street Pizza.",0
20867,"Title: Jazz Tunes Surpass the Cuisine at This Hyped Steakhouse

My anticipation was high for an evening out at this well-praised steakhouse, having been lured by glowing Yelp reviews. The night kicked off on a high note with a delightful duo jazz ensemble setting the mood in the establishment's dimly lit, cozy bar.

Upon arrival, we were promptly escorted to the upstairs dining room, which maintained the pleasant ambiance. Service was efficient, though our waiter came across as somewhat aloof. However, I appreciated his honesty when he suggested that the porterhouse for three would sufficiently satisfy our party of four — a commendable gesture.

Our culinary journey began with three starters, which, unfortunately, fell flat. The slab of bacon was passable, while both the beet salad and caprese lacked excitement. A surprise hit was the complimentary mushroom ravioli, which was a delectable treat and stood out as the highlight of the starters.

The main event, the porterhouse steak, was a letdown. Instead of a single, thick cut, we received two thinner steaks. While the meat was tender, it did not meet my expectations for a steakhouse with such a stellar reputation. Accompanying sauces were bland and failed to elevate the dish.

Side dishes were a mixed bag: the charred broccoli with garlic and chili was underwhelming, and the mac and cheese was average. On a brighter note, the sautéed mushrooms and fries, especially when savored with their steakhouse sauce, were enjoyable.

Wrapping up, with the abundance of innovative steakhouses in New York City, this experience left me without the urge for a repeat visit. Despite the charming jazz and atmosphere, the culinary experience was not memorable enough to warrant a return.",1
16297,"My husband and I stumbled upon this gem during a city stroll, courtesy of a Yelp find. The concept is straightforward yet utterly delightful: a perfect pairing of succulent burgers and lobster that can be savored steamed or boiled. The tenderness and sweetness of the lobster meat were standout features, and both it and the burgers were cooked to perfection. The service was commendable, particularly impressive given the brief 10-minute wait on a bustling Saturday evening. A must-visit for anyone with a hankering for a well-executed classic with a twist.",1

10463,"Restaurant Review:

Regrettably, our experience at this much-hyped venue left us underwhelmed and feeling the pinch on our wallets. Our party of four ventured in on a Saturday, amidst a buzz of high expectations, and ordered three touted specialties: snails in curry, crab fried rice, and khao soi.

The snails, while cooked well and paired with a bold curry possessing a hint of citrus, didn't justify their $16 price tag for six morsels strewn within a deceptively shallow wooden dish. Adding naan to sop up the scant sauce only accentuated the sting of overpricing.

The crab fried rice faced criticism for its lack of any discernible flavor and unwelcome departure from the ideal texture of fried rice, being mushy rather than fluffy. The saving grace, if any, was the sufficiency of crab meat, despite the dish requiring additional condiments to boost its palatability.

Finally, the khao soi presented a mixed experience. The curry sauce and noodles earned some praise, while an excessively dry chicken drumstick and an overload of salt soured the overall impression. Excessive thirst post-meal was a testament to the dish's imbalance.

For a Michelin-starred restaurant, the visit was a letdown, and despite the allure of its reputation, our single visit will likely remain just that—a single visit.",1
2528,"I am so glad I came across Nino's 46 while I was walking back from the Rockefeller Center to my hotel (in Times Square)! At first, I was a little frightened because of the amount of people waiting to be seated. Thankfully since I was a party of 1, it was very quick! Never thought I'd be happy to eat alone, but what do you know. I had two glasses of their cab (not sure the exact name, it's the $17 one on their menu) and it was fabulous! Bold and amazing. For my entree, I ordered the Fettuccine which had lots of seafood - 2 shrimps and 2 lobster tails. I could tell the pasta was homemade! Everything was tasteful and delicious. I ate all of it even though I was full... After all that, I still ordered the Nutella Brownie! It wasn't just a brownie, it had a delicious cookie baked in. Wonderful surprise. All in all, I highly recommend this Italian restaurant!",0
3228,"Title: Hearty Hot Pot Haven with a Few Misses

My recent visit to this hot pot restaurant left me with a smile, thanks to the succulent fatty beef and the flavorful lamb that had me reaching for seconds. The pork bone broth was a deliciously rich base for the hot pot, infusing every ingredient with depth.

I appreciated the all-you-can-eat (AYCE) options, which cater to both vegetarians and carnivores alike – a thoughtful touch for groups with diverse preferences. However, the sauce bar was lacking sacha sauce, a personal favorite, which was slightly disappointing.

While the meats were a hit, I cannot say the same for the seafood combo. The crab, in particular, was unfortunately inedible and emitted an overpowering fishy taste that diminished my enthusiasm for the meal.

In summary, this spot is worth visiting for meat lovers and veggie fans, especially for the AYCE choices. However, steer clear of the seafood combo to avoid a less than savory experience.",1
13679,"Title: A Delightful Brunch Experience

I recently visited this much-raved-about restaurant while in the area and I must say, it lived up to its glowing reviews. With an extensive and tantalizing menu, making a choice was a delightful challenge. Despite its busy Saturday brunch scene, the early afternoon timing meant that our wait was surprisingly brief.

I indulged in a well-crafted Bellini, which, while on the pricier side, was a perfect start to the meal. The breakfast skillet was the star of the show – a hearty combination of potatoes, sausage, poached eggs, and a generous sprinkle of cheese. It was a satisfying dish that hit all the right notes.

The side of biscuits was equally impressive, baked with aromatic herbs and served with a decadent honey butter that was simply irresistible. Service throughout was attentive and without fault, adding to the overall excellent dining experience.

In summary, this spot is a gem worth recommending for anyone in search of a charming brunch venue in the city. Great food, lovely drinks, and a bustling yet welcoming atmosphere – this place ticks all the boxes.",1
2353,"It's extremely busy so you need a reservation. I came on a Friday at 7 on and was able to sit at the bar. We got the chicken wings (5/5) - soooo spicy but amazing seasoning with some cumin I think (and I don't even like cumin), worth the burning mouth. We also got the salted cod rice (5/5) - perfectly seasoned with salty cod fish and some creamy dressing. Loved it!! However the green beans (1/5). Super hard and dry beans (my friends thought they were raw) with just a bunch of crunchy toppings and basically no beans. Sometimes we want veggies to actually taste the veggies and this was a bunch of breadcrumbs with poorly cooked beans. However, they were nice enough to remove it from our bill, so appreciate the service!",0
17868,"NY and pizza are pretty much synonymous, so trying to find a legit spot can be a daunting task.  Especially depending on the neighborhood you are in (NY is a big place, keep that in mind).  I never really had any go-tos when I was younger and frequented the city more often (I was always more into the toy shops, but can you blame me?).  So, for where I was, I saw Bleecker St should hopefully do the trick- and you better believe, it sure did.We were already stuffed from all the other places we had eaten (but hey, my friend told me he wanted to gain 20 lbs in a weekend, I think I was able to do that for him).  I figured though, a cheese pizza between 5 people shouldn't be too detrimental.  This place is located on a busy street with lots of angles and other restaurants.  There is a small patio (where we sat), which was great for all the people watching.  They have 2 rooms you can sit inside as well, but the weather was perfect, I mean, why not?They serve pie whole and by the slice.  They have specials, so keep an eye out for them.  I wanted the basic cheese- because hey, if you can't make a cheese pizza, then you shouldn't be allowed to make pizzas at all.When the pie was ready, I couldn't wait to bring it to the table (I waited near the cashier to bring it, while I happened to meet a very drunk girl who lived around the corner [or so she claimed]).  I took my first slice, and...Holy shit, this was hands down one of the best cheese pizzas I had ever eaten, any style.  Top 3 I have had (my other favorites include Lou Malnati's out of Chicago and O4W out of Duluth, GA).  The flavors, the crunch, and the simplicity.  I was glad everyone was getting full- that meant more slices for me.  I think they were just as impressed.I can't remember how much I paid, but it wasn't bad at all.  I mean hell, I almost took another one togo, but our night was still young and I had to save room for more journeys down the road.If you are a fan of pizza, this place is not to be missed.  The staff is very friendly as well, and they do what they can to make sure you are pleased.  I was pleased for sure, I can't wait to go back!",0

11220,"Title: A Mixed Bag of Italian Treats at the Local Market

Walking into the bustling market with an appetite for Italian, my wife and I stumbled upon this charming little stand boasting an array of goodies. Our eyes immediately caught sight of the garlic bread, which, while not a traditional offering in Italy, is a guilty pleasure that, in my opinion, only the soulless could refuse.

We were particularly intrigued by their deal on Rice Balls – three for seven dollars felt like a steal between fellow aficionados (fist bump for the brotherhood of Rice Ball lovers). We eagerly opted for the Broccoli Rabe & Sausage and the Ragu, enticed by the promise of hot, Italian balls.

However, the experience hit a bit of a snag when we discovered the sauce was an additional dollar – a minor inconvenience, but a ding to the wallet nonetheless. Moreover, the absence of utensils was a notable oversight, as one does not simply eat saucy Rice Balls without the aid of a fork.

Taste-wise, the balls were underwhelming; they lacked the punchy seasoning one would anticipate from good Italian fare. They were satisfactory but certainly left room for improvement – they need a bit more zest, a bit more life, akin to a soccer ball needing a good kick to truly come into play.

In conclusion, while the experience had its highs and lows, my final impression was that it was good, but not quite at the heights of greatness. For this Italian food lover, the balls, while nice, were a bit deflated and in need of a flavor boost.",1
3160,"Title: Consistently Satisfying with a Veggie Twist

I've dined at this restaurant several times, and it's a tried-and-true favorite, though its popularity means it's best to visit during off-peak hours given its cozy size of just eight tables. The real standout is the market side menu, boasting an impressive selection of over twenty vegetables, which encourages diners to venture beyond their usual home-cooked staples.

Opting for vegetables doesn’t feel like a sacrifice here; the lemon-grilled asparagus sprinkled with Parmesan, the depth of flavor in the roasted eggplant with cucumber and tahini, the perfectly balanced sautéed Brussels sprouts with honey Dijon, and the savory-sweet green peas with shallots and bacon all demonstrate the kitchen's prowess. Although the sautéed broccoli was underwhelming during my last visit, it was a rare hiccup in an otherwise delightful lineup.

Portions are generous – I often end up taking some home. Health-conscious guests can request dishes without butter or oil, a testament to the restaurant's flexibility.

Don't miss the grilled salmon with its perfect sear for a meaty option. And while the sidekicks like garlic mashed potatoes and mac and cheese are comforting, the mango lemonade with a splash of Prosecco, while refreshing, can be too diluted for my taste.

In summary, another gratifying meal reaffirming why this spot remains on my go-to list.",1
13829,"After discovering NY Pizza Suprema on Yelp and being enticed by the high praise it received, I can now personally vouch for its excellence. A mere 20-minute stroll from my home, it has become my go-to for an outstanding pizza experience. From my two visits, every slice has been delightful, save for the less-than-perfect eggplant topping, which was disappointingly soggy.

The standouts for sure are the Pizza Suprema and the classic Margherita — both fail-safe options that tantalize the taste buds. With an array of pizzas still left to try, I find myself eager for my next visit. At $5 to $7 per slice, the value is undeniable. If you're in the area, a stop at NY Pizza Suprema is a must. It may very well be Manhattan's finest pizza, turning simple pizza cravings into dreamy satisfaction. Hats off to NY Pizza Suprema for a truly sublime slice of the city!",1
20040,"Casa Mono gives other NYC tapas restaurants a run for their money. It's a cozy, intimate space in Gramercy with great food and wine.The tapas may not appear to be large servings, but are all pretty rich and enough to share with at least 1-2 others per plate. Our favorites were the skirt steak and meatballs. The patatas bravas did not appear as aesthetically pleasing as some others I've eaten; however, they were topped with a deliciously Smokey aioli. Plates are on the more expensive side for tapas, but the amount food was adequate. Would recommend 4-6 per two people depending how hungry you are. We ordered 6 for two of us and probably could have cut down by one, but it's always nice to try multiple dishes.",0
19258,"I recently visited a recommended spot for a lunch catch-up with an old friend, conveniently situated near her workplace. Opting for the salmon toast complemented with sunnyside up eggs, I found the dish to be both delicious and satisfying; it was thoughtfully paired with a refreshing mixed green salad, and the flavors harmonized beautifully. Despite the constraints of a typical lunch hour, the experience was commendable. To ensure a seat in this delightful establishment, I'd advise future patrons to make a reservation.",1
18899,"I love this place. I love the people that work here, the quality a d taste of the food and the pride they have in their products!! I decided to get delivery because I wanted...I Needed! Their squash cassoni. Sweet zucca, cheesy , I think pancetta? In a delicious pocket. SO GOOD! So I got it delivered. Along with tomato, bufala mozzarella, arugula, basil piadine with balsamic glaze. So...the cassoni-on point, perfect, delicious, comforting. The piadine was soggy. Full of arugula. Hardly any cheese (let's be honest-i get it for the perfect combination, but mostly for CHEESE!). The piadine was sitting in a puddle of balsamic, mozzarella, tomato juice. It was like buying into a soggy arugula and tomato piadine. Not good. Now...this is the first time I've gotten something delivered, a d maybe that combination of ingredients just does not deliver well. I cam understand that. But skimping on cheese?! That should be wr happen! I love bufala music.  I love non solo. But I want to keep believing in it and I want to be able to have faith and confidence in the fact that the delivered items will be solid and up to par too.",0
21008,"Definitely not a Vietnamese food expert, but I certainly enjoyed my time meal here. On a cold and snowy day with a little hangover, pho was my best friend. The seafood pho was reasonably priced and has very delicious broth. Lots of seafood and I chose egg noodles, very tasty! Next time I should go rice noodle, but everything was really tasty. The star of the meal was actually chicken curry with bread to dip in. This is something I had no idea about but its some chicken drumsticks on a plate of delicious curry with warm baguette to tear and dip. SO GOOD! The curry wasn't too spicy but was very, very flavorful! The chicken was really tasty as well and the bread was warm and perfect for dipping. I felt bad for management because when were just about done, a couple brought in a service dog, but didn't appear to be a legitimate claim and they didn't have any proof to back it up - really put management in an awkward position and the couple got way too defensive about it and caused a scene.",0

My latest culinary adventure took me to a Korean BBQ spot that's absolutely worth any potential wait. This establishment elevates the BBQ experience by offering an irresistible array of refillable side dishes, with the corn and cheese concoction being a personal highlight. Here, the service shines as the attentive servers expertly cook the meat for you, allowing for a relaxed and sociable dining experience.

The soju selection is limited yet satisfying, featuring just peach and grape flavors - both are delightful and complement the meal perfectly.

15545,"So good. Location: we went to the Ikinari steak at east village where I am but surprised that it's no longer stand-up steaks. There are actually seats to eat steak. Thank god!Food: had their ribeye and sirloins for our dinner with potatoes and broccoli as our side. Medium rare as our choice. It's good. Cheap and good. I just cannot image how they can cook the steak so tender and juice. When I finished half of the steak, I had the passion of ordering another round. But the portion here never cheats. I am too full to do another after the steak. Service: don't forget to tip them! The waitresses here are nice and welcoming and informative.It just made the whole experience much better at dining here Overall: food is exceptional! 4 stars",0

Finding truly delectable Mexican cuisine in NYC can be a quest, yet there's a gem that stands out for those in pursuit of a genuine taco fix.

14372,"Title: An Exquisite Lunch at a Gem of a Restaurant

My recent visit to this amazing restaurant was to reconnect with an old friend, and it was an experience that went beyond just catching up. Yes, the prices are steep, but the quality and satisfaction we received justified every penny.

Opting for lunch proved to be a wise choice, offering a slight relief on the wallet. We were immediately struck by the casually elegant ambiance - a nice setting where diners felt comfortable in casual attire.

The menu tantalized our taste buds starting off with the tuna and salmon; a dish that masterfully played with lightness and flavor complementation, enhanced by an unexpected crunch adding delightful texture. The chicken malai tikka followed, striking a perfect balance of creaminess and a spice level that invites even the spice-averse to indulge without fear.

My friend's choice, the roast lamb, was reminiscent of Peking duck in its interactive fold-your-own serving style, an enjoyable and delicious twist on tradition.

We wrapped our lunch with the makhan malai, a dessert that left us enamored with its airy lightness - a perfect sweet note to end our meal.

The only slight drawback was the restaurant's acoustics; the high ceilings did little to dampen the buzz when the place filled up. Nonetheless, this did not detract significantly from our overall great experience. This restaurant is a true culinary treasure, ideal for both special occasions and memorable lunches alike.",1
14629,"This is the second Xi'an Famous Foods location I've ever been to and this one is equally good as the one I first tried in East Village a year ago. I ordered the dry lamb noodles and it was everything I wanted. If you're not sure what to get from their expansive menu, definitely give this dish a try. If you haven't had the hand pulled noodles from Xi'an before, you're in for a treat. If you're familiar with pappardelle, then think of the noodles here as the Chinese variant. The wide noodles here are a perfect complement to the spicy oil poured all over the dish. There's no such thing as a flavorless bite as the spicy oil adheres to the noodles effortlessly. The noodles themselves are cooked perfectly al dente. Portions are large, and the dishes here run roughly around $10. Other than the limited seating, I honestly have no complaints. Xi'an is a great spot for a quick lunch or dinner.",0
1411,"I had a satisfying takeout experience from this restaurant, where my order was promptly ready in 10 minutes. While the initial price of $7 per rice roll seemed steep, the generous portion size and ample toppings offered value for money. The rice noodles impressed with their smooth, thin texture.

The beef & shrimp rice roll boasted succulent, tender beef and four sizable shrimp, though the shrimp were all placed on the top, affecting the balance of flavors with each bite. The bbq pork rice roll, on the other hand, had a more uniform distribution of meaty morsels throughout, which I appreciated. Both options were packed with taste, leaving my palate more than satisfied.

A word of caution for future patrons: this establishment operates on a cash-only basis. Nonetheless, the quality and heartiness of the meal ensure I'll be returning.",1
20931,"After months of anticipation, I finally visited this quintessential NYC brunch spot. The charm of the restaurant was undeniable, though it came with the caveat of cramped quarters. Battling the brunch-time crowds resulted in an hour-long wait, which we filled with a visit to a nearby cafe.

Upon being seated, the no-fuss and delectable food was quick to erase the inconvenience of the wait. Prices were fair, especially by New York City standards. While the delay might deter me from joining the weekend rush again, I'd consider a return during quieter hours.

For those who haven't experienced this adorable establishment, I recommend it highly for at least one visit. It lives up to the brunch hype and is a must-try in the city.",1
2091,"Petite Boucherie used to be another French spot named Dominique Bistro, where my boyfriend and I had one of our first dates.

Everything was very tasty, and while we didn't get dessert, I'd definitely try the tarte tatin next time.",0
2141,"Title: A Charming Evening at Grotta

My wife and I recently made our second visit to Grotta, drawn in by the irresistible allure of cannolis from Caffe Roma just across the street. While we often plan our evening around the post-dinner pastry delight, Grotta itself has carved out a special place in our dining routine. My wife insists that I mention the music selection, which truly sets the mood and elevates the dining experience. Coupled with the excellent service we've consistently received, Grotta makes you feel right at home.

Admittedly, I've savored better Italian cuisine elsewhere, but there's an undeniable charm to the atmosphere here that keeps us coming back. Dining at Grotta isn't just about the meal; it's about the full experience. A noteworthy tip for fellow patrons: don't miss out on visiting the restroom downstairs—it's part of the unique Grotta charm that completes the experience.",1
17601,"I recently dined at this upscale establishment during Restaurant Week 2019 and the experience was largely impressive. The petite filet was the star of the show, arriving tantalizingly on a sizzling plate, while the accompaniments of creamed spinach and mashed potatoes were satisfactory, yet not remarkable. The bread pudding dessert, however, was a delightful surprise that rounded off the meal splendidly.

Opting for the wine pairings at an additional cost of $18 proved to be a wise choice; the selection complemented the meal flawlessly. The starter salad, however, fell short of expectations and seemed unnecessary amidst the other standout dishes.

This restaurant exudes sophistication, making it a fitting venue for a date night, a romantic celebration, or any formal occasion. The presence of a dress code sign upon entry reinforces its elegant ambiance, and provides a welcome excuse to don your best attire.

In summary, although it is on the pricier side, this restaurant offers an overall delightful dining experience suitable for those special, dressy occasions.",1
14362,"Three stars here means decent bar experience. We were a little disappointed in the quality of the pub food, however.I love pub and tavern food. Murphy's Law wings were a little dry, not juicy. The Shepherd's Pie was also just ok, not the superblast cozy comfort food wow that you get at some other taverns when you order Shepherd's Pie. Bartender was extremely nice, however. Old Fashioned Cocktail was A plus. The Guinness from the tap was amazing. When you get a Guinness that has been properly managed, the taste and creaminess are unbeatable. That was the case here.Big TVs dominate the scene. So if you are looking to watch a game and have a perfect Guinness, this place fits that bill perfectly.",0
18311,"I recently had the pleasure of dining at Los Mariscos and it was nothing short of phenomenal. Despite the inevitable wait time, the experience was well worth the patience. Upon arrival, the complimentary saltines and fried corn chips, paired with an array of salsas and hot sauces, offered an enjoyable prelude to the main event.

The heart of the meal consisted of enchilado, a fiery dish brimming with perfectly cooked spicy shrimp, and some of the most delectable fish tacos I've ever savored. While I didn't indulge in the beverages, they presented a visual treat that nearly tempted me to break my restraint – their delicious appearance promising refreshment.

Be warned, Los Mariscos doesn't promise a tranquil dining setting; the bustling atmosphere is part of its charm. The venue thrums with vibrancy, making it an ideal spot for those seeking a lively dining experience complete with superb drinks and excellent fare.

For an unforgettable taste of the sea and a jubilant ambiance, I highly recommend a visit to Los Mariscos.",1
18325,"I was in the city with my boyfriend and 4 other couples for a show at mansion square. It didn't take long for us to get a table. The waitress wasn't very friendly which brought down my mood for this dinner. One of us ordered a drink and the orange juice they used was bad... had to return it. We all ordered our food and it took 30mins for us to get our food... when the food came, some of the orders was all messed up. One of us order a burger with bacon and nothing but lettuce on it and when it got to her, there was no bacon and there was tomatoes,pickles, and etc on it... my sandwich was okay, not special.our experience was not great at this restaurant.",0
2602,Probably some of the best Mexican I've had in the city! The portions aren't enormous but the taste packed a punch. I had the lamb barbocoa burrito and it wasn't too oily or salty. The homemade red hot sauce was spicy and the red creamy sauce had plenty of zest. Their tamarind and virgin pineapple drink is excellent too. Will have to be back to try the rest of the menu.,0
17256,"Second time at Emporio and they really do consistently deliver a quality meal and excellent service. For starters, we ordered the heirloom cauliflower and charred octopus. Both dishes were well flavored, but the portions are small for the price - $19 for one small octopus tentacle and at $14 for what seemed to be one caulifower floret chopped into smaller pieces. However, the entrees were a sizable portion. The brick over chicken was juicy and definitely a shareable dish. We also ordered the burrata pizza which came on a perfectly thin crust, delicious sauce and toppings - would highly recommend. Emporio gets pretty busy on weekends, so I encourage you to make a reservation if you want a nice, intimate table... though sometimes they can squeeze you in at a high top table last minute. Will definitely be back!",0
2691,"Title: A Taste of Santorini at Souvlaki Gr – A True Greek Delight

My love affair with Greek cuisine didn't end after returning from Greece, it merely shifted settings to Souvlaki Gr in our city. This gem provides an authentic Greek dining experience reminiscent of a breezy evening in Santorini. Despite the Thursday night buzz, our group was seated promptly, and the attentive staff walked us through the mouthwatering specials.

I zeroed in on the chicken Souvlaki wrapped in a fluffy pita and a juicy beef Kalamakia skewer, both of which were sublime. My husband doubled down on the chicken Souvlaki, while our friends enjoyed a comforting lentil tomato soup and a hearty Greek burger. A side of Greek fries completed our feast, each dish bursting with flavor and cooked to perfection.

The ambiance strikes the right balance for a laid-back date night, a lively outing with friends, or a casual gathering with coworkers. Complementing the delicious food is the courteous and prompt service, reasonably priced menu, and spotless facilities – the clean restroom deserves a mention.

For anyone in midtown seeking an authentic Greek food fix, Souvlaki Gr is an outstanding choice. Its ability to accommodate a sizeable crowd without faltering in service or quality makes it a must-visit.",1
19058,"NYC Winter 2020 Restaurant Week (RW) Lunch reviewI came here yesterday with 11 other colleagues for RW lunch. Reservations were easy to make thanks to OpenTable app. We were given a private room since there were so many of us and it was pretty nice to have a room to ourselves. So for RW lunch, you had to pick an appetizer and entree which costs $26 without tax & tips. Some colleagues ordered drinks (i.e soda or iced tea) that was $4.25 each for themselves.I ordered the Caesar salad for appetizer.The salad was fresh and delicious. For entree, I ordered the roasted chicken and it comes with mushroom parmesan risotto. There also some chopped up pieces of asparagus in the risotto as well. This dish was super filling and I didn't expect that there would be two big pieces of chicken breasts. I definitely enjoyed my meal. I was so full and I took some of my leftovers home.Service was good. Our waitress was very friendly and nice. Although, it took awhile to get our entrees. At least everyone's food came out all at once. Overall, definitely come to Capital Grille for RW and take advantage of RW menu offerings!",0
20745,I was excited to try this place because of the great things I had heard and I was not disappointed! The bottomless drinks were delicious and the servers were very attentive and made sure that your cups were always filled. They also played really good music and the food was delicious and affordable. I came on a Saturday and it filled up pretty quickly ali can imagine Sundays this is a very popular brunch spot. For the quality and price I would highly recommend this place.

11431,"Title: A Disappointing Delivery Experience

I’m usually in agreement with Dave Portnoy’s scores, but a recent experience left me questioning a 7.8 rating for a local pizza spot. Starting on a positive note, the sauce was flavorful. Unfortunately, that's where the good ends.

Our delivery ordeal began with our first DoorDash driver cancelling; while this wasn't the restaurant's fault, what followed certainly was. Despite a request for a fresh pizza after the delay, what we received was a haphazard mess. Pre-cut pizza slices were carelessly stacked with paper plates between them, resulting in a frustrating and cheesy disaster.

The presentation felt like a slapdash afterthought. Pulling slices from the plates meant losing half the cheese, and the mixture of cold and tepid slices indicated a lack of freshness. Toppings had been scrapped off onto the box lid, further evidence of negligence.

Such a mishandling of an order is unacceptable. The staff's actions not only wasted our money but also put the restaurant’s reputation at serious risk. A disappointing experience indeed.",1
11528,"I feel slightly crazy for not discovering Crispo sooner.  The first I visited the establishment was to seek out a drink after a long week at work.  It was pouring down rain and their bar looked kind of lonely (my fav type of bar environment).  My friend and I popped in and grabbed a nice cold libation and the bartender, Javier, was extremely pleasant.  This lead me to come back again but this time for dinner.  Their food is out of this world. Here are my favs:- Orchiette - Garlic Bread with cheese - Calamari- Creme BrûléeThese will all change your life!This spot is perfect for date night, outdoor dining, large groups, or a casual happy hour.",0
12441,"FINALLY came here with friends after hearing from a few people that this place is amazing. My friends from Canada were actually craving for ramen and asked where we should go. This was one of the first places I thought of and I'm glad I chose this place. It was not a poor decision made to show my Canadian friends of good ramen here in NYC, heh.I ordered the Tontoro - which has a very creamy pork broth and it's super yummy. If you're someone who likes thicker and richer broth, this is a good one for you. The noodles are the thick wavy yellow ones and they pair very well with the broth. My boyfriend ordered the Truffle Miso ramen and oh man, if you are in the mood for true truffle taste - please help yourselves and go for it. The broth is super truffle-y but not in an overwhelming way at all.We got the uni toast too and there was actually a pretty decent amount of uni on it. The toast itself is small but the uni really makes up for it. It tastes fresh and they added salt to the uni to enhance the flavor (smart). The gyoza wasn't bad either - instead of pork, they use shrimp.Absolutely will come back and absolutely recommend for you to come and try it. It's a yummy ramen place! It's small but worth a try :)",0
11925,"I've been to Los Tacos No. 1 an infinite amount of times but I've never gotten around to writing a review for the spot. That's all changing as of now and I'm happy to share my most recent experience at one of my favorite taco spots in all of NYC.A friend asked me where the best taco's were in NYC and where we could grab some to have an opportunity to catch up. Los Taco's was the first place that came to mind and we decided to go for it. The spot is located in meatpacking's Chelsea Market. Although I'm not one for mall style restaurants this one is worth the trek through the crowds.We arrived around 6 on a Monday evening with only a few people in line. I've been here before when the line extends to the main hallway (aka more than 20 people deep). I was relived to know we'd be getting through the line in under 5 minutes this time. When it came time to order I went with three pollo asado tacos ($3.75 each). The meat they use is always well seasoned and today's tacos didn't stray far from that. Apparently these are more on the expensive side to some but in all honesty just from the quality and taste alone, it's worth it. The spot itself has more of a take out set up. You order and then go to another employee who asks you what you want on the tacos. There's not that much seating right near the actual restaurant so we walked a little farther inside the market to find some seats near another one. In my opinion this is one of the best taco spots based on taste, service, and quantity. I'd definitely recommend to anyone looking for a memorable taco experience in the city.",0
2900,"I went with a friend for dinner and it was amazing! We shared the following:-stuffed garlic flatbread: this comes with cheese inside and it is amazing! -chrysanthemum salad: this comes with garlic, sesame, and Parmesan.

These were so light and fluffy and the sauce was great. I would recommend. -buffalo milk caramelle: this came with a cantaloupe and black sesame sauce which made this dish a bit sweet. I didn't love this dish-lasagna: you have to get this. We ordered too much food and this was even amazing reheated the next day.

My crew dove into several bowls of pho, which arrived steaming and aromatic – a special nod to the beef balls, perfectly bouncy with a satisfying chew. 

We shared spring rolls next, cautioning they're served piping hot, but paired with the fish sauce and lettuce, they were a crispy delight. My choice, grilled chicken over rice, proved a winner; the meat was impressively tender, complementing well with the tangy fish sauce, while the fresh cucumbers and tomatoes provided a refreshing crunch.

Despite the generous portions, leaving me with leftovers, my palate was more than pleased. Thai Son is a definite must for anyone looking for a comforting meal on a chilly day – count me as a fan!",1

I opted for the 100g curry katsu meal set which, priced at a reasonable $15, included miso soup and came with a crisp cabbage salad. The katsu itself was impeccably crispy and, when paired with the aromatic curry, resulted in a deeply satisfying meal.

The quaint ambiance of the restaurant, accommodating around 20 guests, adds to its charm, ensuring a cozy dining experience. What's more, the establishment follows the Japanese custom of no tipping – a refreshing approach that simplifies the dining experience. Highly recommended for tonkatsu enthusiasts!",1
13438,"I visited this restaurant on a busy Tuesday evening and was seated promptly, though the place filled up quickly. The cramped setting and lack of air conditioning made for a somewhat uncomfortable experience during a hot day. I ordered the whole chicken with rice and beans, which was a generous portion but ended up being more than I could finish in one sitting.

While the chicken was juicy and adequately flavored, it wasn't particularly exceptional or distinguishable from what you might find elsewhere in the city. It fell short of the high expectations set by recommendations I had received prior to my visit. The meal felt more akin to fast, casual takeout rather than a unique sit-down dining experience.

Considering the ample portion sizes, the restaurant could be a good option for family gatherings. However, with many other less expensive options around that offer similar quality dining, I wouldn’t prioritize returning here.",1

The sushi itself was good not the best and not the worse.  The waiter was accommodating, I have a sesame seed allergy and forgot to notify the waiter.

I recently celebrated a friend's birthday at this charming Italian spot on a bustling Friday evening, and I was thoroughly impressed! Nestled right across from a lively dive bar, the restaurant offers a warm and inviting ambiance.

The service was impeccable, with attentive waiters making sure our experience was flawless from the get-go. We were promptly provided with menus, drinks, and a basket of bread paired with a delectable garlicky olive oil.

I chose the seafood linguini, a delightful departure from the classic fra diablo, and it didn't disappoint. The pasta was brimming with succulent mussels and shrimp, and the extra grated Parmesan cheese I requested added a fantastic layer of flavor.

Regarding the drink, while it wasn't particularly strong, it was quite enjoyable. However, it's worth noting that this seems to be the norm for many restaurants.

Overall, this place is a must-visit for anyone craving authentic Italian fare with service that's sure to make you feel like family.",1

1091,"PURCHASED: Horiatiki Salad (L)TOTAL: $13PROS:+ supple: It was more than enough to be fed off of. I have never tried ordering a salad at a restaurant before. This was the first time. I did not regret my decision. What came with the salad that was particularly tasty were these sort of rices wrapped in live leaf papers.+ olive-rolled something: that little bite size olive-rolled something was real good. CONS:- declining in popularity: Heard this place was in a decade of decline. Prior to this decade it reportedly was very delicious and reputable. - expensive: It was quite expensive. I think the only why they don't try is because so many tourists come by this area. It is close to the Broadway shows. Therefore, unsuspecting tourists or visitors will come by and give them business. However, it isn't the best and true representation of good Greek food which is a dam shame. Why pay so much for low quality? IMPRESSION:I did my research of the location. I read through 2 pages worth of reviews. I reached out to someone that reviewed this location and had a history of returning. Marlene A. wrote her last review and the second page. She stated that she would never return again after having come in the past. I had no choice but to go this evening. I asked her if I had to choose something from here as someone who has never purchased anything, she responded with, ""Avoid. We've been going for over 10 years. Will never go back it's old and tired. I'm of Greek heritage too. And so overpriced. If you want really nice Greek go to The Greek in TriBeCa if you want down and dirty Greek go to Kiki's in the east village. It's authentic.""

I stumbled upon a remarkable little restaurant during a lunch break stroll that has quickly become a favorite. Despite the line out the door, the wait was absolutely worth it, signaling the popularity of this local haunt.

Initially apprehensive about the a la carte menu, I was pleasantly surprised by the reasonable prices. The chicken tostada and tacos were simply divine, offering a no-frills but flavor-packed meal.

The service impressed with its swift efficiency, complementing the bustling, stand-room-only atmosphere. Remarkably, this eatery has soared to the top of my dining experiences in the northeast.

For anyone nearby, I wholeheartedly recommend going the extra mile to visit this establishment. I eagerly anticipate my next visit once the city reopens its welcoming doors.",1
348,"I have been here two times with my husband. One time for last year's restaurant week and another time for my birthday, two days ago. The food has been consistently good and the service as well. This is one of my favorite Mediterranean restaurants. It is on the pricey side so I definitely won't be able to go all of the time, but I wish I could.I ordered the Mediterranean style bouillabaisse and my  husband ordered the New York Strip. My dish was so flavorful and delicious. Thinking about it makes my mouth water. It was the perfect size too. My husband's steak was a very large portion. It also came with the MOST delicious truffle potatoes and salad. I hate rare steak and I even liked my husband's steak.We also got a half carafe of Pino Noir. It paired perfectly with our meal. For dessert, I got the cafe gourmand option. For $8, it came with coffee, two praline cookies, and a petit dessert of my choice. I chose the pot de cream. It was the perfect size and was very tasty. We will be back again. If you want a classy atmosphere paired with an excellent meal and great service come here!",0
11973,"Title: Charming Ambiance and Flavorful Dining Experience

My recent visit to this restaurant proved to be an excellent choice for dinner, especially given its stunning decor. Despite holding a reservation on a bustling weekend night, a short and reasonable wait of 15-20 minutes ensued, which passed quickly at the bar downstairs.

Once seated upstairs, the high ceilings, as depicted in their Yelp photos, added to the restaurant's elegant atmosphere. The service was amiable and contributed positively to the dining experience.

The food certainly lived up to the surroundings. The crab cakes, served with a simple arugula salad, were a delectable starter. The duck entrée was notably juicy and tender, with well-balanced flavors, although a hint more orange could enhance the dish. For dessert, both the crème brûlée and bread pudding were tasty, though they didn't particularly astonish, they were still very satisfying.

In summary, I'd gladly return to this restaurant and suggest giving it a try. The overall experience – from the ambiance to the cuisine – is well worth a visit.",1
10073,"It did not live up to my expectations. The menu presents commonly seen Americanized Szechuan food, so as the taste of the food. The menu is not up to date either. Food is a bit pricey (perhaps normal for this area) but with generous portions. The place is not busy (we went on a Sat night around 7 PM). So the dining environment is quite pleasant. Staffs are really friendly too.One last comment is that they use Lipton tea bag instead of real tea",0
16291,"If you're searching for a spot that nails the quick Szechuan flavor, this is the place. We ordered the Mapo Tofu and Beef with Green Beans with an extra kick, and it was a flavorful delight that required no rice to satisfy. Service was speedy, and while my spice threshold could've handled more heat, it's perfectly pitched for those less accustomed to it. The ambiance is casual and friendly—ideal for dining with pals. Kudos to the amiable staff. Definitely recommend and will be returning.",1
15117,"My first order / delivery during this crazy time of COVID-19. The Marshal doesn't charge for delivery fee, so keep that in mind if you're thinking of tipping the deliverer. Got the mushroom sausage pizza, and was more them enough for two people or even just one. You can tell it's made super fresh, because it arrived warm and the flour dusted off it was all over the box too - in a good way! Loved the crust because it was a great blend of crunchiness and softness... if that makes sense. Hope to try more of their stuff. Support local small businesses!",0
14392,"Esca has reopened, but it is still very much a work in progress. Esca closed for three months after a fire and reopened for dinner on September 1st. The new dining room looks great, but the food and service has not been similarly upgraded. First on the service. If you are going for a rustic atmosphere, the front of the house staff needs to lose their attitude and remember that Esca is on the far West Side at the mouth of the Lincoln Tunnel (since I was born in Hells Kitchen I mean no disrespect). Also, for a staff with an attitude it is somewhat odd that when you ask a question they pull papers from their pockets and read an answer (the restaurant reopened on 9/1 and we were there on 9/24). The cocktails were ok, except that the bottle aged Negroni was supposed to be on a ""Big Block"" of ice. Instead it came over small pieces of ice. Since the temps were in the 80s and the doors to the patio were open the ice melted and the Negroni was quickly diluted. The selection of vegetables we ordered was excellent. The bread was mediocre and there was no olive oil or butter offered. The Spaghetti All'Aragosta had good flavor but the pasta was extremely dry. The swordfish was also good but unevenly cooked with some parts cooked well done and another portion almost raw. The desserts were very disappointing. Their Amaro selection is very good and I ended the evening with Amaro Montenegro. My wife asked if they had any Chardonnay by the glass and they brought it in a small carafe (which is fine), but when she asked what it was she was told simply it was from California. This is not the proper response for a $22 a glass wine. I looked it up online and it is a Frank Family Chardonnay from Carneros which is an excellent wine and should not be ""marketed"" by the wait staff as if it is some generic wine from Lodi. Unless you are within a block or two free Esca it is not worth the trek at this stage. Hopefully they will quickly get their act together.",0
13991,"I had a delightful experience trying out the Korean ramen at this spot, a pleasant change from the usual Japanese fare. The broth struck a fantastic balance of flavor and spice that was downright addictive, while the pork was remarkably tender and savory. Highly recommend for those looking to savor the rich taste of Korean ramen.",1
14778,"I stumbled upon this gem while craving clam pasta and it did not disappoint! The dish was a delightful nod to authentic Italian cuisine, boasting generous portions of seafood perfectly balanced with oil, herbs, and cheese. Although I opted for takeout and can't speak for the dine-in experience, the quality of the food has me eager to return — next time, the lobster fettuccine is on my radar.",1
15503,"I stopped by here on New Years because I was on my way to Bryant Park and wanted a little snack. I believe this Paris Baguette is new and recently opened up. The interior is very clean and organized. There are not many tables to sit at, so it may be a bit difficult to find seating if they are busy. The employees are friendly and happy to answer any questions.I ordered 2 chai lattes and 2 raspberry fruit pastries. I really like the raspberry fruit pastry because it was the perfect amount of sweetness. The raspberries didn't taste unfresh/old either. The chai latte was good, but I do wish it was a bit sweeter. It seemed like there was very mininal amount of sugar added into it and mainly milk. So, if you would rather have a drink that isn't too sweet, I would recommend the chai latte.Overall, I had an amazing experience here and would definitely come back if I am in the area.",0
13030,"Title: A Gem Worth The Visit

I recently had the pleasure of dining at this delightful restaurant and I am already planning my next visit! I swung by on a Sunday at 11:30 am and was greeted by the absence of lines, though I'd suggest getting on their Yelp waitlist beforehand to avoid the usual crowd. The standout dish was the kimchi cheese Hong chun cheon; a revelation with its tender chicken perfectly complemented by flavorful kimchi. Adding the recommended potato slice elevated the experience further. Portions are generous, requiring a minimum order of two servings, but it's just the right amount for a pair. Should your appetite demand more, topping it off with their fried rice after your main course is a fantastic choice. A must-visit spot for a delectable meal!",1

19901,"Only stopped in for a beer for happy hour. Pretty cool garden area. It was very zen. The IPA was $4. They also had Stellas on happy hour for $4 and some wines for $5. Happy hour was from 4 - 7. But beware, they charge you tax on it, even if you pay with cash. It was a hefty beer though, and delicious. Service was good, nothing over the top. I know a lot of people here complain about the hookah and the food, but I didn't try any of that so I can't really comment. Overall, if you are coming here for happy hour for a bit, I would recommend.",0
16269,"As soon as you walk in, you see a bunch of beautiful pizzas, LOL. They offer many different options here; we went with the pepperoni, chicken parm and margherita slices. All pizzas were really good and fresh. The chicken parm was really filing. The place is very clean. Someone got up and left the table dirty and an employee went to clean it right away.If I am ever in the neighborhood again, I would definitely stop in.",0
1992,"Title: Fantastic Fare Amidst the Frenzy

My dining experience at this establishment was tantalizingly close to perfection, with only the waiting experience preventing a full five-star accolade. Facing February's chill, the limited outdoor shelter had patrons huddling like penguins, with overflow encroaching upon those seated at the bar, much to everyone's discomfort. This congestion extended to diners near the entrance, who found themselves surrounded by an eager awaiting crowd.

Despite reserving for a party of eight via Resy, a 20-minute wait still prefaced our seating. However, once escorted to a spacious table at the rear, the culinary delights began to unfold. The tie-dye pizza, an item of much acclaim, certainly did not disappoint – it's clear there's a secret ingredient at play here that elevates their offerings.

In summary, while the food hits euphoric notes, the initial waiting chaos struck a discordant one.",1
12704,Really good ramen at a solid price! Perfect spot for a chilly day and fulfilling that ramen crave. Executed well with a delicious broth and a good amount of protein in the soup. Got a miso broth which was delicious but there are a ton of spicy as well as cold noodle options. The staff was attentive and there's a good amount of seating. Overall solid and gets the job done!,0
3310,"Went here as a group of 4 for Saturday brunch. Walked in at about 12:15 pm and were seated right away. They say, they don't take reservations for groups smaller than 9!We were seated upstairs and this place has some decent outdoor seating as well - perfect for a warm summer day! We got the 90-minute bottomless option with our entree. Bottomless options are Bloody Mary's, Mimosa's or Bellini's.Drinks were just OK and were too watered down. We tried one of each. Bellini's by far were the best and Bloody's were just too watered down. Our waitress was attentive though and kept filling our glasses within those 90 minutes.For mains, I got the Irish Brekkie ($16) which had Eggs any style, Sausage, White Pudding, and baked beans with Home Fries. Food was good, and food arrived within a few minutes of placing our order. My wife ordered the Huevos Ranchero's ($13) which she did not enjoy much and said that it was quite forgettable.Service overall is very good and after we were done with our food and 90-minutes drinks, and once we settled our check, we were requested if we could vacate our table as there was another party of 5 which had reservations! We were happy to accommodate but just surprised how a group of 5 could reserve a table ;-).The only problem we had with this place was that music was too loud to have conversations with your friends. Overall though, a very positive experience and we'll definitely visit again and will hope to get outdoor seating!",0
11385,"Really lovely spot - from the outside looks smaller than the reality inside. Made a lunch reservation before heading to the airport and that was a food choice, even for a rainy Sunday afternoon there were people waiting outside for the doors to open! And the dining room started to fill up pretty quickly so again grateful for the reservation I had booked. Had to get the wings because it seems like you'd likely get run out of the place if you don't order them! The arrived hot hot hot so had to let it cool for a sec. flavor was great, it was on the brink of being too spicy for me but really was probably perfect as I wasn't interested in eating many of them to begin with. An order of 8 costs $15 which seems a bit steep if you ask me but hey, I get it. The wings are their thing and they know where their bread is buttered! I decided to get the hu tieu chay veggie noodles with tofu and other yummy stuff. The thing is when dishes like this show up in front of me I will often make the ""rookie mistake"" of thinking well jeez... it's a bowl of rice noodles with some vegetables and tofu in a brown sauce... surely I could make this myself! Yeah, but you know you can't make this mix of flavors and the slight char on the noodles and the tofu won't be the same or nearly as good. I could have polished off a few more bowls of the stuff, it's ADDICTIVE! But the next bit of reality is that it was absolutely the perfect portion. I almost licked the bowl clean for sure but I left feeling very satisfied and not at all sorry about what could have been simply an expensive lunch but instead was a way satisfying and delicious and a wee bit pricey lunch.",0
1730,"I recently decided to check out Som Tum Der after hearing numerous positive remarks. The menu presented a unique selection, diverging from the traditional Thai dishes I'm accustomed to. While I ventured to try something new, the experience fell short of my expectations. The rice carried an overly fishy flavor that didn't sit well with my palate, and the Pad Thai packed an unexpected spicy punch that was more intense than I preferred. Unfortunately, this meant I couldn't quite enjoy the meal to its fullest.",1
20113,"Title: A Spicy Sojourn at Szechuan Mountain House

Upon the quest for some delectable eats in St. Marks, my friend and I surrendered to the allure of Szechuan Mountain House, a spot that's received its fair share of buzz. The ambiance of the restaurant immediately transports diners to what feels like a quaint Chinese village, complete with charming decorations and a pseudo-outdoor pond setting—a refreshing escape from the bustling city.

Be wise and consider a reservation; we waited a solid 30 minutes for a table. Once seated, the service impressed with its swift and friendly manner, debunking any worries of a long wait for food.

Our daring choice of three spicy dishes was a test to our palates. A tip for fellow diners: intersperse the fiery options with something milder unless you're a heat-seeking enthusiast. The standout dish, mapo tofu, was not only delicious but also generous in portion, proving great value for the cost.

In summary, Szechuan Mountain House is a commendable venue for those looking to indulge in authentic and robust flavors, just be mindful of the spice levels when ordering to fully enjoy the culinary experience.",1
13770,"I have been here before and the food was amazing, but my visit yesterday was a disappointment.Recommended it to my girlfriend and we got a seat quickly. We ordered chicken empanadas to share. I got the vaca frita and she did an avocado wrap.Empanada - good in flavor but the dough was stale on the outside and raw on the inside. You could tell it was not fried long enough. ($10 for 2)Vaca frita -  shredded steak and rice with black beans. The steak was dry, chew, and overly salted. It was pretty gross. The only thing I enjoyed was the beans. They were beautifully seasoned. ($24 - way overpriced)Avocado Wrap - basic veggie wrap. This is hard to mess up but fresh plantain chips on the side would be better than the stale, store bought stuff it came with. ($13 - very high for veggies wrapped in a tortilla)Overall: Overpriced and poorly cooked Cuban food. The place can get loud. Servers aren't that great, while food runners acted like waiters (they were amazing). I'm sure their rum bar is decent. But come for their black beans!",0
12039,"Following an enjoyable outing near Radio City Music Hall, my son and I chanced upon this welcoming restaurant during our stroll back to Grand Central Station at about 6:15 p.m. The service impressed us with its promptness, allowing us to relax without delay.

13109,"Title: A Cozy Culinary Retreat at The Lodge by Bryant Park

Last Sunday provided an unexpected culinary delight after my partner and I stumbled upon The Lodge, a charming rinkside bar and food hall nestled within Bryant Park's Winter Village. The manageable crowd allowed us an easy entry into this festive haven, perfect for a post-lunch stroll.

The Lodge immediately impressed us with its warm, convivial atmosphere, featuring a cocktail bar that beckoned us in with its holiday cheer. The range of eateries resonated with the diverse palette of New York, including the likes of Ovenly's baked goods, the comforting Pierogi Boys, smoky offerings from Mayhem Smokehouse, and The Stackery's unique attraction.

It was The Stackery that caught my eye – its chimney stacks, an Eastern European specialty, reminded me of my first encounter with these delightful spiral treats at Asbury Park's Oyster Fest. Despite not having tasted them yet, their aromatic presence was tantalizing.

Whether you're in search of a spirited drink or a satisfying bite, The Lodge at Winter Village is your charming pit stop in the heart of the city – a perfect blend of coziness and culinary exploration.",1

The only menu item I haven't been crazy about are the tacos, everything else has been out of control delicious !I've  been ordering with them during the quarantine, and the food is just as delicious to go! Each hot sauce or salsa is individually packaged, they do a great job. You can tell they really appreciate your business.

Even if you get the plain cheese pizza with the red sauce, which is one of my favorites, it's so cheesy and flavorful. One of my other favorite is white pizza which is a bit creamy. You can literally bite into the small bits of cheese on the pizza and it's amazing! If you are visiting NYC and want to experience the classic New York style pizza in its best form, definitely visit Joe's pizza. You won't regret it!",0

There is nothing else like this in the neighborhood and I was thrilled to support this place but I was not as happy as I would liked to have been after eating here. I came here for lunch and I must say the lunch prices are great. I paid something around $14 for a pork slider, fries and a side of grits. I would also like to note that the gentlemen that helped me was very kind and welcoming. The price and the service was absolutely not an issue, what was an issue was my food. So lets start with the grits, the grits were good I had no problem with that. The fries were good as well but the pork slider is where I had a major issue. To be exact it is listed as the chopped pulled pork and gravy slider on the menu. The slider is actually on a biscuit which I did not expect because it was not indicated on the menu but I am always open to new ideas so that was totally fine. The problem was the biscuit was definitely burnt and it was hard. That alone to me was unacceptable. The other thing that I did not like was the pork. It There was not much pork on the slider to begin with and it did not taste too good. Very fatty and no flavor.  I hate to say it but the food was ready so fast (10 minutes) it made me wonder how long it may have been sitting there. Unfortunately I just did not get a fresh vibe. Again, I wanted to love this place as I love Southern food! I wouldn't totally give up on this place but first impressions mean a lot.",0
18683,Visited this place as it's right next to where all my classes are held. So after a long and an exhausting class I decided to give tabonette a try!

Will be back to try their salmon!,0
13468,"We came here last night after dinner. Valerie is a gigantic cocktail bar/eatery with a huge window-like backdrop behind their many bottles. It definitely distinguishes itself from the downtown cocktail bars, where people are crammed next to each other and dying to get the bartenders' attentions.They have an extensive menu of specialty cocktails that they brew. We got to try the Hemingway Daquiri which was refreshing and a little bit tart because of the grapefruit flavor. We also got to sample the These Stories Told was a nice spin on a mezcal-based drink. But, the drink that really won me over was the pisc-cola. It comes in a cute little glass bottle, and tastes similar to an Inca cola soda. Granted that we came here after dinner, all the cocktails stirred up a drunchies pang in us and we ordered a side of fries. They have a special version that comes seasoned with black truffle and soaked in duck fat that I am curious to try next time.The service was fantastic. Our bartender was always accessible and he was very friendly. I'll definitely return to Valerie.",0

I visited this gem of a spot on my brother's recommendation and it did not disappoint. As someone who has always been skeptical about raw oysters, with my only prior experience being in Amsterdam, I consider myself more of a fried oyster aficionado. However, the oysters here have converted me – they were incredibly fresh and served at a surprisingly reasonable price.

The highlight of my visit was the server's insider tip about the upcoming happy hour. Their advice to wait just 30 minutes saved me a good deal, as the east coast oysters dropped to just $1 each! I left already planning my next visit. If you're in the city and fancy some quality shellfish without breaking the bank, this is the place to be.",1

My girl gang of 3 went for dinner and ordered wine and a plate of 5 cheese and meats (jambon, pâté, Brie, comté, and one other cheese i can't remember). You can't go wrong with cheese and charcuterie, and this plate was no different. It was also very filling and they refill the toast basket!!! Amazing.Two of us ordered the crispy ravioli and the other had the grilled Brie. I've never had mini crispy ravioli and it was truly an experience. The sauce was amazing and tbh I still think about it. None of us finished our meals after the amazing charcuterie plate so safe to say we were highly satisfied with our meal. 100% would return to Le Pif.Only minor issue is how tiny the place is, but we didn't have to wait long for a table on a Saturday night.

I recently had the pleasure of dining at [Restaurant Name], and it was an exceptional experience! Arriving at the sweet spot of 5PM on a Thursday ensured I was seated immediately, but by the time I wrapped up my meal, a queue had already formed – a testament to the restaurant's popularity.

The standout starter was the washugyu tataki, a delightful dish where the tangy ponzu, scallions, ginger, and carrot perfectly accentuated the flavors of the meat. For the main course, the niku udon with its tender beef short ribs and honeycomb tripe proved to be an umami-rich sensation. The broth was robust and flavorful, while the noodles boasted an ideal chewy consistency.

The portion size didn't disappoint either, with a generous amount of meat swimming in the soup. This udon is truly a must-try for noodle enthusiasts. My palate was so satisfied by the meal, I'm already planning my next visit to explore more of their udon varieties. If you're a fan of authentic, hearty noodles, [Restaurant Name] is a must-visit destination!",1

As a garlic enthusiast who prefers firmer noodles, I was delighted by the ability to tailor my bowl to my tastes. I highly recommend splurging on extra mushrooms for their delightful texture and the perfectly seasoned egg. If you're willing to overlook the cost, your taste buds are in for a treat.",1
1602,"My review of Tonii's Fresh Rice Noodle is based on only one visit. It was literally a quick hit and run type of meal which consisted of only one dish, a pork rice roll (a.k.a. cheong fun). The restaurant looked relatively new with yellow walls and cartoon decorations. The order counter was way in the back of the restaurant. There's also a large blackboard on which the entire menu is written. Much of the menu wasn't written in English, so I asked to see a paper menu. Surprisingly, they didn't have one, so I just asked them to make a pork rice roll for me. The man who took my order asked me to have a seat and he would bring me my order.At Tonii's, the rice rolls are served on a foam plate just like the ones at Joe's Steamed Rice Rolls. It's also about the same size. What you get here isn't the crepe-type of rice roll that's rolled around a filling, but the type that is steamed in a pan and scraped. When I tried the rolls, it immediately brought back flavors of old-school Chinatown rice rolls. This means that the rice rolls are chewy and starchy. The rolls look very white compared to ""delicate"" rice rolls that are translucent white. The old style was very comforting and a definite contrast to the ""elevated"" rice rolls that are just now hitting New York City. The soy sauce provided by Tonii's was only slightly sweet, with a noticeable saltiness. This was surprising, since rice roll soy sauce should be a bit sweeter. Finally, the meat was decent. It was particularly well-marinated, but has a nice soft texture.Overall, you can't argue with a $4 pork rice roll. Yes, it's cheaper than those new kids on the block. But in my view, there should always a place in Chinatown that does it the old way.",0
10137,"Title: A Hot Pot Haven at Shi Miao Dao

My quest for the perfect hot pot led me to Shi Miao Dao, a gem that promises authentic flavors. Amidst these challenging times, their attention to health protocols with readily available disinfecting wipes and hand sanitizer immediately put us at ease.

The menu, though straightforward, offers an indulgent selection of hot pots. I opted for the chef's special, featuring handmade shrimp balls and an assortment of seafood. The accompanying small dish ingredients, ranging from quail eggs to various mushrooms and tofu varieties, created a symphony of textures and tastes. The experience peaked as they presented a sizzling stone pot with broth, guiding us to craft our meal with precision and ending with a swirl of rice noodles — a delightful spectacle.

Service was impressively swift, ensuring our pot was bubbling in no time. Generous portions at reasonable prices mean Shi Miao Dao is not just a meal, it's an experience we won't hesitate to revisit for more culinary explorations.",1
21093,"Title: A Scrumptious Lunch at M&M

I had the pleasure of visiting M&M for lunch and let me tell you, it did not disappoint! The star of the meal was the M&M burger, stacked with beautifully caramelized onions, crisp lettuce, ripe tomatoes, and a generous slice of American cheese. The onions were a particular highlight with a divine garlic sauce that elevated the entire experience. The quality of the food was exceptional, indicative of the care put into their dishes.

To complement my burger, I savored a mojito that was the epitome of refreshment. It was served in a generously sized cup, and it was so delightful that I was tempted to go for a second round. The restaurant's ambiance made it an ideal spot for both a casual lunch or a more upbeat happy hour.

I'm excited about the announcement that they will soon open a rooftop area, which promises to be the ultimate spot for summer dining. Based on my experience, I'll certainly be back to enjoy the view and another round of their delicious offerings.",1

I was lucky to get a reservation within 20 minutes of me arriving. Like most places it has to be booked in advance. I read online they had good burgers and I will agree with the reviews. The restaurant is double the size of most restaurants in NYC. We were sat down right away, given menus and we places our orders. The vibe indoors is cool. Modern yet rustic. They also have a coffee shop inside where they made a chai tea latte with oat milk for my fiancé. She said it was the best one she's had. They have two burger options a single and double. All the picture I saw were double so I was going to order it but the waitress told me actually a single was two patties and a double is three. A little confusing but ok at least she mentioned it before I ordered. We ordered two singles, one with bacon, and one with bacon and a egg. Also ordered the fries with truffle sauce. The burgers were delicious. One of the best that I have had. The fries were a little salty but I loved them as well. Everything had awesome taste.

It was a little frustrating but I'm still giving 5 stars.",0
16419,"During a five-day trip to NYC, my dining experience at one particular restaurant stood out as having the second-best service, a noteworthy feat considering I was traveling with a baby. Despite my modest expectations based on Manhattan's dense population, the staff was remarkably accommodating.

The cuisine was exceptional across the board. Our table enjoyed incredibly fresh salads and a chicken dish with the perfect balance of crisp skin and succulence. The rigatoni was a hit, offering perfectly al dente pasta with a robust wild mushroom flavor that wasn't overwhelming. But it was the fig & olive chicken that stole the show – a beautifully spiced dish that was both memorable and subtle.

The standout of the meal was surprisingly the couscous. Accompanied by various pastes for mixing, it transformed into a celestial blend with each sauce strong on its own, yet complementing each other flawlessly when combined with the airy couscous.

This is a restaurant I'd eagerly revisit, and I'm thrilled to hear they are opening a location in Houston, significantly closer to my home.",1

Holy heck, this place is fantastic. First tip:make a reservation as it's kinda the hottest spot these days. Second one: share your way through the menu so you can try as much excellence as possible! The cheese plate, steak tartare, beet salad, green beans, and foie gras, are all magical. The wine sommelier is fantastic. He got us a delectable bottle of white Bourgogne to go perfectly with our meal. Service is delightful and you walk away feeling like you had a special evening. Can't wait to go back.",0
19747,"Bottom line: Three courses of innovative Korean fusion food in Flatiron for $46 --- not a bad deal!As a Korean American, I am sometimes wary of Korean fusion. But I think the flavors at Atoboy are usually spot on, and everything is beautifully presented.Overall, I felt that the earlier courses are stronger than the ""main"" courses. Some highlights include the yellowtail, sunchoke, and egg dishes. The yellowtail was so fresh and had just the right amount of acidity to really pop. The sunchoke was interesting and the black truffle really complemented it well. The egg was silky smooth and the extra cost for the fresh uni was totally worth it! On the other hand, the pork belly and galbi courses were just OK. The pork itself was a bit dry and doenjang flavor got lost. While the galbi was decent, it did not particularly stand out in any way.Portions are on the smaller side but I think most people will be full after eating all three courses.Definitely worth a try!",0

Would recommend trying this place out maybe once, as it's relatively upscale and pricy.",0

I indulged in the Dijon mussels frites, which were delectably prepared and surpassed my expectations in every way. My friend opted for the classic mussels, and they too were met with approval. Although the happy hour menu is somewhat limited, it didn't disappoint. The options available are curated well and offer something for everyone.

Review: Don't judge this unassuming eatery in Chinatown by its simple decor—the flavors here are anything but. Dive into their dumpling offerings for an exceptional culinary experience; the steamed pork dumplings with chili sauce are particularly mesmerizing. Handmade noodles are the name of the game, and they shine brightly in the beef brisket dry noodles that are nothing short of spectacular. While the vegetarian soup fell short on taste and won't see a repeat order from me, the dry noodles and steamed dumplings alone make this spot a must-visit. In short, come for the dumplings and noodles, stay for the satisfaction of a meal well enjoyed.",1

18318,"Title: Overhyped and Overpriced

My experience at this much-raved-about eatery left me puzzled about its popularity. Attempting an early dinner with friends on a bustling Friday evening, we were greeted by an overwhelming crowd and excessively loud music that stifled any chance of conversation.

I started with a 'pepinada' cocktail expecting a spicy kick, only to be met with an overly sweet concoction heavy on the cucumber. Switching to a basic spicy margarita didn't improve matters, with an imbalance skewed towards too much mixer and a price tag that surprisingly exceeded the online menu.

The shared guacamole was flavorful yet disappointingly scant in serving size. The cheese dip, an unconventional choice, proved challenging to eat, with a texture not suited for effortless dipping. Our taco selection included brisket, which was satisfying, and fish, which was passable but suffered from its diminutive size. The avocado fries, a seemingly novel idea, also fell flat in execution.

Service was prompt, yet overzealous in clearing dishes, sometimes prematurely. In the end, the restaurant delivered a wholly mediocre experience that could not justify the expense. It's unlikely that I'll be swept up in the hype for a return visit.",1

Hubby and I wanted a night out without kids with a last minute dinner plans. Walked over here without a reservation when I was told they didn't take reservations on a January 2nd winter evening. Surprisingly we were seated within 10 minutes of arriving. We did order our drinks  at the bar in anticipation that it may be longer. Ended up taking our drinks to our table with very friendly service. My hubby ordered Laksa noodles & I the basil fried rice with shrimp which we both devoured. I generally don't finish everything on my plate but here I was able to accomplish without even being hungry! That just speaks volumes in my book! We have already told many family members about this place and do intend on coming back our next visit!,0

3299,"I stopped by this fast-casual spot for some tacos and came away fairly impressed. The quality of the tacos was pretty great, and it's a nice touch to see them being freshly made. You order at the cashier, get a ticket, and wait for your turn as the cook prepares your order upon request. Be warned, though – the wait can be a bit of a drag, especially for those of us who aren't fond of long lines. As a Westcoaster, my taco standards are high, so take my word with a grain of salt. But, putting my biases aside, I'd say these are pretty decent tacos for NYC fare.",1

Adding to the convenience, this uptown gem happily accepts credit cards, unlike its cash-only counterpart.

My dining experience last Saturday evening at this charming restaurant was an absolute pleasure. We were greeted with immediate seating at 6:30 pm, though a cozy crowd gathered as the night progressed, creating a vibrant yet comfortable atmosphere.

The culinary journey began with the Peshwari Boti Kebab, a standout appetizer that's not to be missed. Its flavors set a high bar for the rest of the meal. The Lamb Vindaloo followed, boasting fork-tender meat bathed in a spicy, exquisite sauce that justified its praise. Meanwhile, the Aloo Gobi Mattar presented perfectly cooked vegetables with a satisfying spice profile, though a touch more sauce would have perfected the dish. The Garlic Naan served its purpose well, reliable and satisfyingly good, though not particularly extraordinary.

Overall, the restaurant delivers a dining experience with wonderful flavors and a comfortable setting, ensuring I'll return soon to sample more of their culinary delights.",1

From the moment I stepped into this Japanese-Peruvian culinary gem, I knew I was in for a treat. Each dish served here offers a delightful twist on tradition, masterfully incorporating Peruvian flair that surprises and pleases the palate.

Though the prices are on the higher end—expected given the upscale Japanese influences and the prime city location—the experience is entirely justifiable. You're not just paying for food; you're investing in an adventure that tastefully bridges two rich culinary worlds.

The staff is attentive without being intrusive, ensuring a seamless dining experience. As for the setting, it's thoughtfully laid out with a spacious, open-air feel, allowing for easy conversation—no need to raise your voice to be heard here.

And a personal tip: for an enhanced sense of intimacy and space, request seating at the back. It's like stumbling upon a secret haven where you can savor every bite in the privacy of your own company or with your companions.

In summary, this restaurant is a must-visit for anyone yearning for a memorable dining adventure that's both innovative and comfortable.",1

To be fair, it could have been they were experiencing a drop in patrons due to coronavirus, but their pleasant demeanor was pleasant nevertheless.The food was phenomenal. I had perhaps the best NY strip steak ever, and on a couple of occasions the waiter moved a sizzling morsel of heaven from the serving dish to my plate to save me the muscle strength of doing so myself. The crab macaroni and cheese was phenomenal. A mouth watering delight. And the lobster bisque? One word...phenomenal!To add icing to this phenomenal cake, when I booked on Open Table I indicated we were celebrating my wife's birthday. So when I was waiting impatiently for the check, having now forgotten I mentioned this on my reservation request, they came out with a phenomenal creme brûlée birthday desert for her, complete with candle and happy birthday mini-sign in it.  Suffice it to say, this level of service was...you got it...PHENOMENAL!",0

The dishes took up a lot a space and our table wasn't big enough so we had to throw the small side dishes into our soup to clear the table.The soup (curry coconut) was too bland for me. You can get a free rice noodle refill. I didn't because I was already full. The beef that I added into the soup was also flavorless.

12590,"Title: Mixed Feelings at the Hyped Tsukemen Spot

After much anticipation from hearing rave reviews about its sister location in LA, my friend and I finally decided to check out this ramen joint, famed for its Tsukemen or dipping ramen. Without reservations, we did have to wait, which wasn't too lengthy; however, the cramped waiting area, partly consumed by door curtains, was slightly uncomfortable.

Kicking off our meal with Chicken Karaage, priced at $7, we found the portion underwhelming. While my friend praised its juiciness, I was left wanting, as the chicken leaned towards the dry side for my taste. Dipping sauce tip: go for ponzu if you like a tangy mayo twist or tartar for a punch of sour soy.

The star of the show, the Chashu Tsukemen, arrived with a promise of flavor. The noodles were notably thick and had a pleasant bounce, but the cold presentation was a letdown, especially on a winter day. I had to request a hot rock to warm them up, which only momentarily chased away the chill before they cooled off again. As I neared the end, the broth's saltiness intensified, complicating the eating experience.

In contrast, the Salmon Donburi was a palate cleanser. The salmon was a creamy delight, exuding freshness, although the ikura tipped the scales towards too salty. Despite the restaurant's acclaim, I'm left uncertain if Tsukemen is for me or if I'd give it another go, this experience not quite meeting expectations.",1

3436,"Title: An Impromptu Delight at Emmy Squared

Stumbling upon Emmy Squared was a serendipitous twist to our downtown adventure, echoing the joyful sentiments of a Bob Ross “happy accident”. With an inviting glimpse of open tables, our party of four was swiftly accommodated, even as the late-night crowd began to thin.

Our culinary journey commenced at the bar with spirited libations, setting the stage for a feast in the side room; the ambiance was relaxed, with the buzz of a lingering large party in the background. We dove into a piquant hot chicken salad, the blue cheese melding harmoniously with the heat, followed by a chicken parm on an unexpected pretzel bun – a comforting, though unremarkable rendition.

Pizza was the night's showstopper, and our ambitious order included the Roni Supreme, the Big Ang, and The Emmy. While the Roni's pepperoni packed a saltier punch than remembered, the Big Ang stole the show with its harmonious blend of vodka sauce, meatballs, and banana peppers – a newcomer to my palette that left a lasting impression.

Pairing the pies with a robust Cabernet rounded out the experience beautifully – there's something inherently gratifying about the marriage of pizza and wine, after all.

As we rolled out into the night, satiated and carrying the one pizza too many that we just couldn't finish, Emmy Squared left us with an unexpected, yet entirely delightful dining memory.",1

Unfortunately, I was very unhappy with my choice, which was the Ora King Salmon. It's basically a brown rice bowl with mushrooms, asparagus, egg, and salmon. The brown rice, egg, and salmon were in fact delicious. My issue is with the portion - so small that the bottom of the bowl wasn't even fully covered. The salmon was probably around 2oz (5 thin strips), and the mushrooms were barely existent, which was extremely disappointing to a mushroom lover. My coworker ordered a salad with salmon (+$12); while his salmon filet was considerably more substantial than mine (around 4oz), the salad itself was too basic to justify the price tag ($19).I'm not simply dissatisfied with the absolute values of the portion or price, but in tandem.

19831,"Title: Authentic Korean Flavors That Warm the Soul

I recently visited this Korean restaurant with a friend who hails from Korea, entrusting him with the menu choices. Our table was graced with soybean stew, succulent bulgogi, and a comforting kimchi stew. While each dish had its charm, the bulgogi, with its sweetly marinated beef, claimed the spotlight for me with its delectable and unique flavor profile.

The soybean stew was satisfactory but perhaps the least memorable of the trio. However, the kimchi stew truly shined, especially given the chilly weather outside. Its steamy, spicy broth, complete with tender ground beef, provided a hearty and invigorating experience, keeping warm throughout the meal thanks to the traditional hot stone bowl.

Portion sizes were generous, to the point where a duo of dishes would have sufficed. Whether you're a veteran of Korean cuisine or a curious newcomer, this spot is a must-visit. The bulgogi alone is worth the trip, but don't miss out on the kimchi stew for a taste of comfort. Enjoy your meal – it's one that's likely to linger pleasantly on your palate.",1

As a self-proclaimed grilled cheese aficionado, my New York adventures led me to a spot that's a cut above your typical chain: a cozy haven for all things cheesy and gooey. Nestled in the bustling streets, I found respite during a commercial shoot (yep, that's my shameless plug!) and boy, was it worth the pause.

The staff was the epitome of New York kindness (which, for the record, is pretty darn nice), and they quickly satiated my craving with a grilled cheese that hit all the right notes. The menu, while not expansive, was just right, offering a variety without overwhelming the indecisive eater. I snagged a table without a hitch—perfect for solo diners like myself.

Now, it's New York, so expect a price tag that might make you double-take for a grilled cheese. But trust me, the gooey goodness is pretty spot-on.

If you're roaming the Big Apple with a hankering for comfort food that'll make you melt, do yourself a favor and drop by this place. It's cheesy, it's gooey, it's everything a dairy lover's dreams are made of. Pretty gooey good, indeed.",1

13878,"Title: Solid Meat Quality, Uneven Portions, and Distracted Service at All-You-Can-Eat Hotpot

My experience at the limited-time all-you-can-eat hotpot restaurant was a blend of hits and misses. The quality of the beef and lamb slices notably stood out, perfectly suiting the bubbling broth they provided. Unfortunately, the rest of the offerings were rather pedestrian, nothing to distinguish them from your average hotpot joint.

The inconsistency in portion sizes was a drawback. An initial order of cabbage arrived as a mere fistful, while the subsequent order unfathomably came as an entire bunch. Such erratic serving sizes can disrupt the flow of a meal, especially at a place where you'd expect every round to be similar.

Service also left room for improvement. Amidst the cacophony and sweltering ambiance, it was a challenge to flag down staff for assistance. Moreover, our first round of orders was incomplete, adding unnecessary wait time and confusion to our meal.

Overall, the restaurant delivers on meat quality but fails to offer a consistent all-you-can-eat experience, meriting a 3-star rating.",1

As a self-proclaimed non-aficionado of sushi, I was astounded by how much I enjoyed my experience at this Midtown gem. This eatery boasts a spacious interior, which is a rare find in the area, and the ambiance is both inviting and stylish. With an all-vegan menu that's impressively vast, even the most discerning plant-based diner would be spoilt for choice.

The star of the show is, without a doubt, the Vegan sushi. The Spicy Mang roll, a favorite among regulars, lived up to its reputation and then some. But the surprises didn't stop there. The Fun-guy dumplings were a delight of simple yet satisfying flavors, and the Impossible kebabs were so meat-like in texture and taste that they could easily fool a carnivore. To keep the good times rolling, we opted for the Impossible sliders as well – a testament to how much we enjoyed the kebabs.

To cleanse the palate, the watermelon lemonade was a refreshing finale. While I'm not usually one for vegan fare, this place has me rethinking my preferences – and planning my next visit with vegan friends in tow. Highly recommended for anyone open to a delicious, plant-based culinary adventure.",1

My recent visit to this culinary gem left me thoroughly impressed with its vegan offerings. The menu boasts an array of both savory and sweet vegan delights, ensuring that plant-based diners are spoilt for choice. As a health-conscious eater, I was pleased to find brown rice as an option, a nutritious alternative to the standard white.

The fresh and high-quality chutney was a standout, its vibrant flavors elevating every dish it accompanied. The vegan chicken curry bowl, in particular, was a revelation. Not only was it scrumptious enough to satisfy one's hunger with the possibility of leftovers, but it was also ample for two to share comfortably. This dish struck the perfect harmony with a well-calibrated balance of cucumber salad, brown rice, and vegan chicken curry. The potatoes nestled within were cooked to perfection — soft on the inside with just the right bite.

Service was swift, adding to the convenience of a fulfilling meal without a long wait. 

The only downside? The delightful chutney was so moreish that I found myself yearning for full bottles to take home. Here's hoping the restaurant will consider offering their chutney for purchase in the future. Until then, I'll be content to return for the flavorsome food and the welcoming atmosphere.",1
19263,"Title: A Brunch of Filipino Delights

I stopped by for brunch and dove straight into the heart of Filipino cuisine with the tapsilog and tocilog. Both dishes were authentically flavorful, showcasing the rich culinary culture of the Philippines with perfectly cooked steak strips and savory tocino complemented by garlic rice and eggs.

However, the star of the show was undoubtedly the HaloHalo. It was, hands down, the best I've ever had stateside. Each spoonful was a delightful medley of taro, jackfruit, sweet potato, pinipig, red beans, macapuno, and a scoop of creamy ube ice cream—a symphony of textures and tastes. I left already planning my next visit, and if their brunch was any indication, I'm eagerly awaiting the chance to explore their dinner offerings.",1
14206,"Title: A Birthday Treat to Remember at a Cozy Pizzeria

Last night, to celebrate my birthday, my boyfriend and I decided to try out this pizzeria for the first time, and let me tell you, it was a revelation! Even as a late-night visit, the experience was nothing short of AMAZING. The pizza here is, without a doubt, one of the best I've ever savored.

Although the place is small and prompted us to take our order to go, it didn't detract from the deliciousness of their pies. We sampled the pepperoni, vodka, and mini meatball pizzas - each one a testament to authentic flavors that had us hooked from the first bite.

The thick-cut pepperoni was a standout, and the mini meatball pizza packed a punch even without a traditional sauce. Dipping these delights into the side of marinara sauce only heightened the experience. The vodka slice was equally delightful.

If this is what Detroit-style pizza is all about, consider me a fan! I'm already looking forward to my next visit. A perfect score from me: 10/10, would absolutely indulge in these pizzas again.",1
11274,I've been wanting to eat here since Anthony Bourdain covered it years ago. Today I stopped by for lunch. The decor is very rustic French bistro with a pop of matte magenta color....very cute. The staff were attentive and sat me promptly. I got a sparkling rosé and the zucchini tian. It was an appetizer but nice proportions and was perfect for the light tasteful lunch I was looking for.,0
13925,"Title: Late-Night Pizza Delight Close to Our Stay

On a recent crave-quest for authentic New York pizza, we stumbled upon this gem conveniently located right in front of our hotel. Despite arriving at closing time, the welcoming staff graciously allowed us to order. To our surprise, they served up generous double slices - much appreciated after a long day.

I opted for a classic margarita, but found the BBQ variety superior; however, pizza aficionados will revel in both options. Seating inside was unavailable due to the hour, but we comfortably settled near the windows.

It's worth noting the establishment is Hispanic-run, echoing the diversity in New York's culinary scene, which was reflected by the warm interaction they had with my boyfriend in Spanish.

For those looking for extra flavor, cheese and drinks are on hand to complement your slice. While the pizza was satisfying, I recommend an earlier visit for the full array of choices as our options were limited to the day's leftovers.

The staff's friendly gestures, including offering the ladies — including my boyfriend's brother's girlfriend — larger slices, did not go unnoticed and added a thoughtful touch to our experience.

Overall, this place is definitely worth a visit for a slice of New York hospitality, served with a side of pizza. Just remember to swing by earlier in the evening for the best selection. #Review4of365",1
15247,"For a classy bar with amazing happy hour deals, I'm legitimately surprised it wasn't more crowded on a Thursday at 5pm. During Happy Hour (Mon-Fri 4pm-8pm) they have great deals -- $6 for a negroni, $5 for an old-fashioned, $5 for select draft beers, and more! The location is pretty great too, in the East Village just a 5-10 minute walk from Bleecker St Station. The bartender was incredibly friendly and outgoing, dancing around the bar while making our drinks. I've almost never had such a happy bartender! :) We also ordered beef sliders for $2 each because it was Thursday (they have different Happy Hour food specials every day). That first bite of the slider... Juicy, flavorful, HOT, perfectly toasted bun. You have to come here on a Thursday and experience it. In fact, we were almost late for our dinner reservation because we stayed for another order! (They take a while to come out, so if you're in a hurry, don't order them.)The only bad part was that the bar was a bit squished-- they definitely set the bar stools really close so that you were pretty much rubbing elbows with your neighbors. But if you're not a large person or if you don't have that much stuff, it's not really a problem.",0

Stepping into the restaurant as a Plan B, since the nearby French bistro was swamped, turned out to be a delightful twist of fate. The ramen, the star of my meal, boasted a broth that was both light and rich in flavor— a true testament to their culinary prowess. The tartare, although a decent attempt, left a little to be desired. That said, the experience was positive enough to pique my curiosity about the rest of their menu. I'm already planning my next visit. This spot comes with my recommendation, especially for those in pursuit of a good bowl of ramen.",1
13849,"My friend and I visited NYC for Memorial Day weekend. We wanted some soul food Saturday afternoon, so we did a quick Google search and came across Amy Ruth's. The reviews looked good, so we decided to give it a try.We walked up and there was a short line, so we put our name on the waitlist. We were called and seated in no time. As soon as we sat down, a server came and greeted us. We ordered mimosas and waters to drink and then ordered our meals. After putting in our order, the server came back with a bread basket which was super good! The drinks were okay, but nothing to rave about.For my meal, I ordered The State Senator Brian Benjamin, which are the fresh salmon croquettes. These were some of the best salmon croquettes I've EVER had! Crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside...so great! I ordered macaroni and cheese and collard greens as my sides, and these were less than desirable. The macaroni and cheese had a weird, almost sweet taste and the greens tasted a little sweet too. They looked great, but the taste didn't match how good they looked. I ate a few bites of each, but completely finished the croquettes.This was a cute place, but I don't see the hype...maybe because I'm from the South and have tasted some of the most amazing soul food. But off the strength of the salmon croquettes alone, I'll give this an okay rating.",0
1079,"It's somewhat like a scavenger hunt to find Spot Dessert bar but trust me when you finally find it, it'll definitely be worth the visit. Spot is located inside a food in what seems to be Korea town. As soon as you enter, keep walking until you see a stair well, go up them stairs all the way to the third floor, and then you'll see it as soon as you get up there. The staff was very kind and even give me a little background about their desserts. Since I've been following them on Instagram for some time, I sort of had an idea on what I would order. After I ordered for my cousin and I, we were kindly ask to wait in their private dining area. This section has about 5-6 tables so expect to be a little cramped. After 15 mins, my desserts were delivered to me and they looked too beautiful to eat. We ordered the matcha lava, the harvest, and coconut monkey bread. The matcha lava is a warm dark chocolate cake filled with matcha ganache served with matcha green tea ice cream. This dessert was absolutely delicious and every component complimented each other and taste very balanced. My cousin had their coconut monkey bread that was covered in fall spices, Thai tea drizzle, and served with coconut milk ice cream. She loved it and since she wasn't too familiar with thai inspired desserts she didn't really know what to expect. She continuously raved about this vegan dessert and couldn't stop eating it! We both shared the harvest dessert and it had the cutest concept ever. The harvest has layers of berries, soft cheesecake, Oreo crumbs, earl grey milk tea, and served with raspberry sorbet. We loved the cheesecake portion but disliked the raspberry sorbet. We both felt like it was too tart and threw our palettes off a bit. We ended up not eating the sorbet portion and devoured the rest of the dessert. All in all, Spot was definitely worth the hype and pretty psyched that I was able to try it. The desserts were reasonably priced and portions were average compared to other dessert places I visited.",0
19594,"My boyfriend brought me here for Christmas and we had a fantastic experience! We opted for the $180 option which came with several small appetizers and 20 pieces of sushi. The highlights were the abalone, Japanese uni, medium tuna, scallop, and eel. The monkfish liver was on their seasonal menu, but it was so good we ordered an extra one at the end. All of the fish were incredibly fresh and the ginger offered between pieces was perfect.The counter seats about 10 and there is a small table in the front for walk ins. They offer bag and coat check if you have a lot of things with you. I will definitely be back!",0
174,"I recently visited Bao by Kaya at Urbanspace, 570 Lexington, and I have nothing but praise for this gem of a food stand. Service is swift and the staff exudes friendliness, delivering orders with impressive speed. Their combo, which includes 2 baos and popcorn chicken, is my habitual choice—especially the pork belly bao, which I can't resist doubling up on. At approximately $11.90, the meal is both satisfying and value-packed. For anyone looking for a fast, scrumptious bite in the Urbanspace area, Bao by Kaya should be at the top of your list.",1
20094,"I remember when this restaurant opened about  10-12 years ago. I used to live in NYC. It used to be called Tiffin Waala and was decent. Chennai Garden was a separate restaurant two blocks down. I was a huge fan of Chennai Garden and used to dine there once a week. In the last couple of years, it seems like Chennai Garden shut down and the former Tiffin Waala is now Chennai Garden by Tiffin Waala. I must say the food is so much better now. Maybe they hired the chefs from there. Here is what I ordered:- Bhel: delicious!!! Loved it. Could have used less tamarind. - Rawa Dosa: Amazing. Well made with perfect amount of crispness. -  Filter Coffee: perfectly brewed. Overall, loved the food and can't wait to go back. It's a tough choice between this and Pongal (another South Indian restaurant down the block).",0
20213,"Title: Mixed Feelings at Local Arepa Spot – A Three-Star Experience

I recently dined at an arepa-focused eatery, eager for a satisfying meal, but left feeling underwhelmed, meriting a tentative three-star rating. The arepas failed to impress, lacking the authentic flair I've savored in the past. A cheese arepa presented itself as hard and cold, suggesting it had been sitting out for a while. The touted Downtown Arepa, featuring short rib, also missed the mark for my palate.

On a positive note, the tequeños were enjoyable, although the absence of a gooey cheese pull hinted they weren't served at their optimal temperature. The empanada, however, was forgettable – a ""meh"" addition to the meal. I had hoped for something hot to counter the late hour, but it seemed warmth had waned from the dishes.

The staff were commendable, offering friendly service in a surprisingly quiet setting around 8 PM. Regrettably, my taste buds yearned for their cachapas, which were unavailable that evening.

Despite the shortcomings, the restaurant's commitment to a charitable cause – donating meals to children in need in Latin America – instills a desire in me to return. Perhaps a future visit at a busier time or a different location will elevate the experience to match the generous spirit of their mission.",1
11858,"This pizza is the truth!! Lots of hype surround this one ... celebrity 'endorsers' on Instagram. From rappers to directors to NY athletes, all have featured this pizza in their stories. After a long day of business meetings in NYC, I decided to brave the line in the rain and try a slice (or 3 ...) for myself to see what the fuss is about.The first thing I noticed was that there was only one small marble 'ledge' to one side which you could stand and eat at. The store is small and the line takes up most of the space. There are no benches outside, so if the 8 or so spots at the ledge are taken, you'll have to get it to go, find a park nearby and get harassed for spare change by hoards of the downtrodden while you eat your slices.I tried their famous 'Spicy Sicillian' slice which is a square slice of thick dough literally covered in 1/2 inch of pepperoni pieces. They claim to be the originators of the new pizza/instagram phenomenon of 'pepperoni cups' which is when the slice is cooked so hot that the edges of the pepperoni slices curl up to form little cups. Not sure why this is such a 'thing' but it is.The pepperoni slice was fantastic. The dough was thick but crisp. The cheese was quality. The sauce was a bit on the sweet side, typical of New York pizza and the best part was the thick layer of pepperoni 'cups' with just the right amount of spice to counter the sweet sauce. This was truly one of the best pepperoni slices I've ever had. Worth a 20-30 minute wait? Not for me. Worth a 5 minute wait around 7 p.m. on a Thursday? You betcha! The quality of the ingredients was apparent.I also had a slice of the plain triangular sliced cheese pizza. This was average to above average for NYC pizza. The sweet sauce had nothing to counter it without spicy pepperoni so it was too sweet tasting for my liking. The dough even had a sweet starchy sugary taste. It wasn't a bad slice for NYC but you should be coming here for the Sicilian slice with pepperoni. If you get a regular old cheese slice, you may be disappointed. Joe's Pizza in Greenwich Village about a 4 minute walk from here is my choice for plain cheese NYC slice pizza.Worth a trip if you happen to be in the Bowery district and want a good slice. Lots of celebrity pictures on the wall and a cute little shop. Prices can get up there ... $4.50 for a Spicy Sicilian slice, $32 for a whole pie. $3.10 for the plain cheese slice, $25 for a whole pie. I will say though that you feel full after a slice or two. I would say this is my favorite pizza in the Mid-Town-ish area. And they are very credit card friendly.",0
367,"I recently visited Prince Street Pizza and it was a fantastic experience. Despite a brief wait in a swiftly moving line, the wait was well worth it.

The restaurant also boasts a wall adorned with photographs of celebrities who've dined there, adding a touch of history and excitement to the ambiance. I am eagerly looking forward to my next visit.

Chives rice cake was not good. My friend got the dumplings and that was really good. She got the red curry and that was super tasty. I got the crispy duck with vegetables.

I only had 1 request... no sugar/ skinny because my body doesn't react well to sugar/ agave. They brought me over 1 skinny marg and it was fabulous so naturally I ordered another but this second one tasted off... tasted very different. When I asked why they said sorry we can't make you skinny marg because we don't have time.. I said I'd even pay extra for a skinny/ agave less marg but they refused... clearly the customer is not their priority...some of our dishes were a little questionable and looked like mystery meat in the picture attached.

12761,"Title: A Delightful Lunch at [Restaurant Name]

I recently stopped by [Restaurant Name] for a weekday lunch and was thoroughly impressed with their value-packed special. For just $9.99, I savored their koku ramen at a level 3 spiciness that struck the perfect balance for spice aficionados. The ramen, adorned with a soft-boiled egg half, a tender slice of pork, shiitake mushrooms, and spinach, was immersed in a creamy, garlic-infused broth with a pleasant fiery edge.

While the noodles were thinner than the usual fare, they were exquisitely chewy, absorbing the rich broth for maximum flavor with every slurp. Although a bit more pork would have been welcome, the quality and price point left little room for complaint.

The ambiance of the restaurant added to the experience—bright, clean, and stylishly decorated with an inviting bar setup that allowed for a view of the diligent, glove-wearing chefs at work.

In summation, [Restaurant Name] delivered a fantastic and affordable meal. I'm already planning my next visit to explore more of their tempting ramen offerings.",1
17570,"**Pho-Real Vietnamese: A Missed Opportunity**

Venturing into Pho-Real Vietnamese was an encounter filled with hope and anticipation—finally, a Vietnamese spot right around the corner in the UWS. The warm interior and friendly service suggested a cozy 'slurp and go' experience lay ahead. 

However, the basic beef pho failed to hit the mark. The portions of beef offered were scant and marred by fat, while the broth itself lacked the rich, savory punch so essential to pho. Even an attempt to rescue the flavor with a dash of sriracha fell flat. In a curious first, the noodles were depleted long before the broth—a rarity for this seasoned pho consumer.

The Thai iced tea did not redeem the meal either, and though the experience was underwhelming, the sight of a neighboring diner's appetizing bahn mi hinted at potential. Willing to chalk it up to a potential off day, I'm open to a return visit, because everyone deserves a second chance at getting it right.",1
16713,"Service is super nice. The hostess was very friendly and she called me by my name so I felt super valued. We got lychee bomb, chicken sandwich, oyster omelette, sausage party, and the Lo ba beng. They all tasted soooooo good. Lychee bomb - 4/5 super easy to drink, super tasty but it costed $13..........Chicken sandwich - 4/5 great size of chicken, very flavorful. Only complaint is the bottom bun is soggy from the oil/ sauce. Oyster omelette- 4/5 oyster taste good but the overall taste is a little dull even with the red sauce. Their food is very spicy especially this oneSausage party - 4/5 $8, the cheapest item on our order but the tastiest. Only complaint is the sauce in the middle is very short so after two bites, there's pretty much the sticky rice sausage left. Lo ba beng - 4/5 very tasty and good portion size. But almost 90% of it is completely fat. Very guilty and if you don't like the texture of fat, it's not gonna be pleasant. Very flavorful tho. I think their food is generally pretty spicy. The omelette and chicken sandwich got me struggling a little bit but they are all very tasty and flavorful. However, my bill end up being $80 with tips and tax, a little bit on the pricier size. When you compare it to actual Taiwan price for these food, it's a pain to think about.",0
18494,"Tucked away in the bustling streets of K-Town, this gem of a Japanese curry spot hits the mark with its authentic and flavorful offerings. Diners can tailor their meal starting with a base of rice, udon, or pasta, then select from a variety of curry types. The customization continues by choosing the spicy level and various add-ons.

I opted for the scrumptious seafood cream curry pasta, served piping hot, which provided a comforting warmth. The spice level #2 had a pleasant kick without being overwhelming, and the complimentary toppings of green onions and garlic were a nice touch. To elevate my meal, I added a perfectly fried croquette and chicken cutlet. While the chicken was slightly dry, it was easily remedied by the rich curry sauce.

Although service could improve in attentiveness, the overall dining experience didn't suffer much. The set menus and donburis beckon for a next visit. If you're in K-Town and craving a satisfying Japanese curry with a short wait time, this spot is definitely worth checking out.",1
1935,"Title: A Cozy Spot for Authentic Chinese Delights!

My culinary escapade at this local gem, known for its hometown lu fen, was nothing short of exceptional. The restaurant, albeit pricier than some, justifies every penny with its quality offerings.

The lu fen was a standout, teeming with a variety of meats entwined with delicious noodles. It radiated comfort with every bite. Complementing this was the Three Delicacies - a simpler dish that won me over with its clean, fresh flavors.

The cauliflower, a special Chinese variety, was a revelation. Tiny but mighty in taste, it was jazzed up with impeccably cooked pork, balancing crispy skin and succulent meat, with a hint of unexpected sweetness that truly delighted me.

While the spare ribs were satisfactory, they didn't dazzle me like the lu fen and cauliflower did. While they're a reliable choice, they're not the main attraction here.

In summary, count me as an enthusiast for this fancier-side Chinese eatery. It's a spot that's well worth a visit for anyone craving authentic flavors with a homely touch.",1
16113,"Title: Nostalgic Ambience, Disappointing Service at a Historic Hotel Restaurant

Walking into the restaurant nestled within the grandeur of the hotel was akin to stepping back in time; its old-school charm preserved even through modern upgrades. The setting immediately captivated me with its cafeteria-esque reminiscence of 70 years past.

Taking a seat at the bar, excitement to engage with the menu was somewhat deflated by the indifferent welcome from the waitress, whose attentiveness seemed preoccupied elsewhere. A request for beer offerings was met with a brisk point towards the menu, and her patience waned further when discussing cheese options for a grilled cheese sandwich.

Service continued to be spotty as the food arrived. My request for mustard resulted in an encounter with the hottest variety I've ever tasted, and a follow-up check on my meal came prematurely—I hadn't even taken a bite. Further attempts at service fell flat; a request to turn down the overpowering music was ignored, and a manager openly criticized a staff member in the dining area.

The grilled cheese itself was average, made with processed Gruyere rather than the true Swiss experience I expected, and the lukewarm fries did little to elevate the meal. It was a letdown from the high hopes set by the atmosphere.

The unfortunate trend of service missteps continued right up to billing. A misunderstanding over beer pricing led to an unpleasant interaction, where honor and customer service seemed to come as an afterthought.

Three stars are awarded solely for the enchanting ambience that so vividly captures a bygone era. Yet, one can only hope for a transformation in service that matches the grace of the surroundings. Returning is a possibility—if only to give another server a chance to redeem my experience.",1

My recent dining experience at [Restaurant Name] was nothing short of spectacular. The food was divine across the board, from appetizers to entrees. A few highlights included the melt-in-your-mouth thinly sliced pork in garlic soy dressing, tantalizingly spicy Sichuan cold noodles, and the consistently satisfying soup dumplings.

Service matched the high quality of the cuisine, with attentive servers who seemed to anticipate our every need. The BBQ spare ribs deserve a special mention for being the best I've ever enjoyed at a Chinese restaurant, with their fall-off-the-bone tenderness. The perfectly crispy soft shell crab also stood out, bathed in an addictive sauce that left us craving more.

Adventurous selections like tomato and tofu soup with thinly sliced beef and pickled pepper, and the braised fish with soft tofu pudding initially raised eyebrows but ended up being an absolute delight. The depth of flavor in each dish was remarkable, and the leftovers were even more flavorful the next day, much to my delight.

All in all, [Restaurant Name] served up an unforgettable meal that was both fulfilling and exquisitely flavorful. This place is a must-visit for anyone in search of top-notch Chinese cuisine. We left full, happy, and eager to return.",1

They have a bar for sauces but all of the other ingredients (vegetables, tofu, fish balls, etc.) are brought over by the servers. We also ordered noodles near the end to wrap up our meal. We ordered individual pots of the herbal broth which was flavorful, unlike some other broths I've tried from various hotpot places.

The drinks were decent but nothing to particularly write home about, and the place is a bit small, but size is tight all over the city and no one was uncomfortable.

I tried making a reservation at his Mexico City restaurant last time I was in town and was unable to, even 2 months in advance.Luckily I got a table for New Year's Eve in  New York City. Walking in the ambience is dark, with a relatively minimalist mid century feel. We got seated in a corner table towards the back, which I appreciate. Sometimes it's nice to be away from all of the action. I soon realize that the clientele wasn't quite what I was expecting. It definitely seemed to be more hoity toity Latin people. Which is not our scene. Service was relatively slow and the tables pretty close to each other so eaves dropping was inevitable. We started off by ordering cocktails and eventually looked at the mezcal list. Our waitress recommended some really good mezcal.We had their Cosme cocktail and ""El Ninja"" both tasty. For dinner we ordered the shared plates: -Yellow mole with squash. Surprisingly very filling. -Uni tostada with bone marrow. Was delicious, every bite very decadent-Artic char aguachile. Small serving but the sauce surrounding this fish makes every bite count. -Black bass served on a green ""mojo de ajo"".  The scales were fried and sticking out they looked like rice (see picture). I've never seen this before nor eaten fried scales but it worked? All in all it was a neat experience and I'm glad we went. With that being said Cosme is definitely meant for wealthier Latin Americans coming to NYC for a fancy meal.  Something to tell their friends about. At least that was the vibe I got that night. Being Mexican American, Cosme was simply too modern for me. It's hard to wrap your head around ingredients you grew up with, which have deconstructed and reconstructed into something completely different. The brain just does not compute sometimes. I do appreciate the effort and time it takes to create the food. You can definitely sense the passion and their mission to elevate Mexican flavors. In this case I felt like I was eating art pieces rather than dining. The tortillas had beautiful dehydrated leaves on them for God's sake. I wanted to frame that thing not eat it.My support for Mexican Chefs, art and culture is here to stay. Voy a seguir apoyando al Mexicano, pero al mismo tiempo dando mi crítica.",0

The attentive hostess instantly recognized us and promptly seated us at the centerpiece table of a remarkably cozy yet elegant dining area, complete with charming archways and ambient lighting.

The aroma of truffles set a luxurious tone for the culinary journey ahead. While my initial choice was salmon, I was enticed by the filet of sole special; tender and flaky, though a tad bland, it was uplifted by a well-crafted lemon butter sauce. The accompanying potatoes were a standout, deliciously charred at the edges, and while the salad was standard, it did not diminish the overall meal.

A taste of my friend's smoky mozzarella chicken confirmed this kitchen's prowess. Perfectly cooked with sumptuous cheese and impeccably seasoned vegetables, it was a dish that resonated with flavor.

The climax of the dinner was the birthday chocolate dome cake—a gastronomic marvel with its luxurious hazelnut filling and a harmonious blend of chocolate and strawberry. Celebratory and indulgent, it truly made my night special, alongside the heartwarming rendition of ""Happy Birthday"" by the servers.

Service at Zero Otto Nove was nothing short of excellent, with a team that was both friendly and efficient, ensuring a seamless and memorable celebration. My gratitude goes to the staff for their exceptional hospitality.

In conclusion, I wholeheartedly recommend Zero Otto Nove for anyone seeking an establishment that combines finesse, flavor, and flawless service. It's a venue I eagerly anticipate revisiting.",1
11781,"During our recent dining experience at the local tapas restaurant, my two companions and I embarked on a culinary journey that left us thoroughly impressed. We kicked things off with a trio of refreshing sangrias, which set the mood for the delightful spread that was to follow.

The Gambas al ajillo were a garlicky delight, their succulence perfectly complementing the rich, savory notes of the bacon-wrapped dates. The croquetas cremosas, with their duo of mushroom and ham and cheese fillings, were a textural masterpiece, serving as a testament to the kitchen's attention to detail.

A standout dish was the pulpo a la plancha. Its charred exterior and tender interior demonstrated the chef's adeptness with seafood. But the true revelation of the night was the squid ink paella. Its unique texture, reminiscent of finely chopped glass noodles, took us by surprise and left us fascinated by the dish's innovative spin on a classic.

The pacing of our meal was commendable, with each dish arriving at just the right moment to ensure a seamless dining experience. The flavors, presentation, and timing were all spot-on.

Delighted by our evening, I'm eager to return and explore their brunch offerings, which, if as thoughtfully prepared as their dinner menu, promise to be another exquisite gastronomic adventure.",1
2146,"Title: ""BEC: A Breakfast Gem Beyond Morning Hours""

If brunch had a kingdom, BEC on 8th Avenue would surely be its castle. A recent outing for Valentine's Day chocolates with my son led us to this charming farmhouse-styled eatery, where the rustic decor is crafted from none other than the storied planks of the Coney Island boardwalk, and the coffee is sourced from the esteemed Brooklyn Roasting Company.

As for the star of the show, the BEC breakfast sandwich, it does not disappoint. On a Sunday morning, with mimosa in hand—offered at a steal for $5—and my son with his freshly squeezed OJ, I dove into the classic BEC on a brioche bun. New York State sharp cheddar, perfectly portioned Applewood bacon, all on a bun that itself is an homage to the sandwich's ingredients with bacon and cheese baked in. Every bite was a symphony of flavors and textures—no bacon-adjusting necessary here.

My son's choice, the Godmother with its Italian meats and cheeses on a hearty Ciabatta, was certainly tempting, but the brioche experience was non-negotiable for me. And indeed, it was righteous.

In sum, whether for breakfast or lunch, BEC is a spot that champions the beloved BEC sandwich with a mastery that makes it my go-to. It's a bangin' take on a classic, in a setting that feels both nostalgic and warmly inviting.",1
18172,"I consistently find myself drawn to this unassuming takeout gem for their lunch specials. While it may seem run-of-the-mill, the quality of the food is anything but ordinary. The tempura, particularly, stands out as the best in the area—exceptionally crunchy and flavorful without succumbing to greasiness. Though the space is small and seating is limited, making it less ideal for dine-in experiences, the delicious offerings have yet to disappoint.",1
14320,"Title: Cozy Vibes and Tasty Bites at Local Irish Pub

Last Monday, I found a gem of an Irish pub just a stone's throw from Times Square, surprisingly untouched by the typical tourist hustle. I was there to unwind with a friend, and the place didn't disappoint, especially with their happy hour lasting until 8 pm.

The atmosphere was warm and welcoming, thanks in no small part to a real fireplace in the back, which our delightful waitress with an authentic Irish accent recommended we sit by. The comfort of plush chairs and the option of couches made it the perfect spot to settle in for the evening.

We indulged in their sangria, which struck a pleasant balance of flavor without being overly sweet. The highlight, however, was the innovative shepherd's pie nachos we shared—a delightful concoction with a sweet sauce and unexpected but welcome mashed potatoes.

The space is versatile, ideal for both large parties and those looking for a cozy corner to chat. Plus, the convenience of credit card acceptance and its proximity to Times Square without the touristy feel adds to its allure.

In summary, this pub is a find with its lengthy happy hour, genuine service, and satisfying fare.",1
15706,"Title: A New York Gem: Veselka

If you're in search of that rare find where decent food, cozy ambiance, and affordability blend perfectly together, Veselka is your haven. Perched on the corner of 9th and 2nd Avenue, this 24/7 Ukrainian diner offers a comfortable setting with ample seating, including barstools and tables, all complete with a bevy of condiments to garnish your meal.

The diner boasts a stylish vibe, seamlessly combining a traditional large bar area with fashionably quaint elements and views that connect you to the bustling city life outside. The menu? Delightful. I tucked into an egg white omelette with kasha, finding it exquisitely prepared, while my companion indulged in blueberry pancakes and waffles that would tempt any sweet tooth.

Equally impressive was the friendly staff, who, even at the ungodly hour of 6 AM, remained attentive, refilling our coffee and tea without missing a beat. Service was swift, ensuring that our delicious meal was enjoyed hot and fresh.

In conclusion, Veselka is a standout. Whether you're a Ukrainian cuisine novice or a seasoned diner devotee, this spot is sure to satisfy. Don't miss out on this culinary treasure.",1
3599,"My recent visit to this cozy eatery was quite delightful. I indulged in the very berry fruit tart which was scrumptious. The pie crust was exactly to my liking, and the fruits adorning the tart were notably fresh. Service was attentive and delivered with a warm smile. The ambiance is laid-back and welcoming, perfect for a casual outing, though seating is somewhat limited. Overall, it was a pleasant dining experience that I'd recommend.",1
11837,"If you are looking for a great NYC brunch deal, I recommend Boqueria (This is my second time enjoying their awesome brunch deal). I went with a group of 5 girlfriends; you pay about $40 per person before tip & tax. This includes unlimited mimosas and sangria for 2 hours (There are three types of sangria containing different alcohol bases). The red is gin-based, White is rum-based, and rose is tequila-based. My favorite was definitely the red, and it was really strong - Sunday funday anyone!?!?In terms of food, brunch is made to order to the number of people who participate. You get to pick 4 tapas, either 2 brunch dishes or 1 paella, and either churros with chocolate or the churros sundae. I recommend the croquettes, dates, warm bread with tomato spread, meats & cheeses, French toast, and churros with chocolate. You get sooo much food. We left with our bellies full and satisfied for sure! Such a great atmosphere, food, and deal!",0
3082,"I recently became a total fan of a KBBQ spot I discovered while visiting friends in NYC. Despite lining up via Yelp and experiencing an additional 20-minute wait at the door, the bustling atmosphere with loud K-pop tunes truly set the scene for an authentic experience. Seated upstairs, the energetic staff balanced hefty plates of raw meat with prowess, enhancing the excitement.

Opting for the beef combo - kalbi, steak, and beef slices, accompanied by soup and green grape soju - we indulged in a savory feast. The array of complimentary side dishes, which were replenished on request, only added to the enjoyment, as did the unique grill-side offerings of egg and cheesy corn.

Our attentive server expertly cooked and cut the meat for us, ensuring a smooth and rapid dining experience. The flavors were spot-on, and I left already eager to return on my next NYC visit.",1
13788,"Wafel + Dinge Review:

Visited this spot next to Bryant Park for a sweet treat and was both delighted and somewhat taken aback by the experience. The waffle, drizzled generously with rich chocolate sauce, offered a satisfying crunch and an undeniably decadent presentation. Each bite was a luscious journey for the taste buds, making it a visually and gastronomically breath-taking experience.

However, indulgence comes at a cost – $8 for a palm-sized waffle can feel steep, especially if you're watching your wallet. While it's a wonderful splurge for a date or a vacation treat, budget-conscious travelers might balk at the price.

Being one of the four tourist-oriented establishments framing Bryant Park, it caters to those looking to indulge. If frugality is key and Japanese flavors call your name, a quick stroll to Sunrise Mart by the library affords a filling alternative with onigiri ranging just from $1.50-$2.

In summary, Wafel + Dinge is a great pick for those seeking a luxurious snack in a picturesque setting, but it's not the go-to for a filling meal on a budget.",1
18100,"What a pleasant surprise this Eataly was tonight. For drinks I had Proseco and for dinner the ""Pulpo"". It's really nice sitting by the bar, you see how the dishes are made kind of makes you feel excited for ideas to cook at home sometime in the near future. At least that's what it makes me feel...Anywayz, having a variety of selections inside Eataly is awesome! Taste the wonders of italy culture in this market full of a few different restaurants and a fresh market shop. This place tends to be a lil pricier than most places around Flatiron, after all everything about it makes it all be worth the cash being spent here. I had two glasses of Proseco, my Octupus , my friend had two beers, and pasta. Total was about $100 no tip included.",0
3378,"Disappointing. That is what this place is. I was having a not so great day, and decided to order some lunch online to treat myself. Found this spot and it had decent reviews. My food came very quick, which can be awesome or bad. In this case it was bad. For a 15 minute delivery time, my food was cold. On top of that the portions were a joke. $12 for tiny chicken tenders and soggy fries, and $10 for a couple Brussels sprouts soaking in soy sauce? On top of that, I had to pay for extra sauces and never even got them. Please save your time and money here.",0
15236,"As a native New Englander, I ventured into this Times Square eatery with high hopes for a classic lobster roll, only to find myself underwhelmed. The lobster portion was generous, particularly given the competitive price for such a prime location. However, the meat was served at a disappointing room temperature and lacked the punch of flavor I anticipated, sporting only a hint of mild seasoning.

The saving grace was the authentic touch of regional offerings, including New England-made craft sodas from Maine Root and the ever-crunchy Cape Cod Chips. Despite these nods to Northeastern fare, the overall experience left me yearning for the rich seafood flavors of home, resulting in a rather lackluster dining memory amidst the bustle of Times Square.",1
2555,"Title: Charming French Flavors with Stellar Service

Nestled in the Upper East Side, this quaint French bistro is an ideal spot for a romantic date or a cozy wine and dinner evening with friends. Despite visiting close to closing time, my experience was nothing short of delightful, especially due to the exceptional service provided by the manager, Bernard. His warm welcome and consistent attentiveness added a personal touch to our evening.

Our first encounter with the escargot was a bit underwhelming—small in size and somewhat drowned in pesto, which masked their natural flavor. However, Bernard's accommodating approach shone when we voiced our preference for larger escargots with less sauce. He promptly catered to our request, and the second serving was spot on, enhancing our overall dining experience.

Bernard's willingness to accept feedback and discuss it with his culinary team truly exemplifies customer-focused service. It's this level of care that ensures diners will return. I look forward to my next visit, eager to delve into their entree selection.",1
12868,"My friend and I were on a mission to find empanadas one night while in the village- thankfully, this popped up and we decided to check it out. Cute restaurant with lots of cute decorations- mostly soccer jerseys and pictures of the pope- cozy and very welcoming. The spot was packed and they were able to squeeze us in- they take reservations which we will definitely be doing next time! Our waiter and all the staff were super friendly, fun and welcoming. We started off with what we were on a mission to find: empanadas, and we were NOT disappointed! We went with chicken and the caprese one. I can still taste the Caprese empanada and I am read to go back to try their other flavors! I went with their cheese ravioli for dinner and of course they had fresh cheese grated on top to make it even better  the raviolis and the sauce it was cooked in was delicious! We were beyond stuffed- serving sizes were perfect, even able to take some home- but then we saw the dessert menu and you always have to have a part of your stomach prepared for dessert! We went with the strawberry and cream, super simple but so delicious! I can't wait to come back to this spot to try their other dishes- they have an amazing menu with a lot of options. Check this spot out, you will not be disappointed!",0
13479,"Title: Hearty Dumplings at the Heart of Flatiron

Tucked away in the bustling district of Flatiron/Chelsea, just a stone's throw from the F train's 23rd Street station, sits a dumpling haven that truly lives up to its name. As a self-proclaimed recluse, I found my solitude respected with quick seating and moderate service— even receiving a glass of water without prompt.

The cafe boasts a proud array of endorsements plastered across its window; New York Times, Zagat, and Time Out New York, each masthead affirming the establishment's culinary acclaim. Indeed, the dumplings served are not only impressively large but also of a quality that could thaw the chill off any secluded heart. For those in a rush, a takeout menu on hand ensures no one misses out.

The dim sum selection beckons with gems like the 蝦餃 (haa1 gaau2) priced at $7.50. These five pieces of shrimp dumplings, reminiscent of ancient Chinese sycee coin pouches, were marred slightly by their delicate skins sticking to the steamer paper—an inconvenience but not a deal-breaker.

The 小籠包 (xiao long bao), at $8.25 for six, was a mouthwatering delight with an authentic burst of Shanghainese flavor. The savory juices housed within these pork soup dumplings made for a tantalizing experience.

Lastly, the 燒賣 (siu1 maai2) did not disappoint. At $7.50 for a serving of five, these sizable dumplings were crammed with a satisfying mix of crab meat, pork, and mushroom—filling enough to satiate the hungriest of hermits.

In summary, this quaint cafe delivers more than just size; it offers a warm, palatable escape suitable for both the bustling lunch crowd and the solitary diner alike.",1
14049,"Our next choice for restaurant week summer 2019 was the Rafele restaurant and bar in the West Village.Upon check in the host asked whether we would like to sit outside, and since the weather was beautiful that night we chose to dine al fresco.Our waiter came and handed us regular menu, restaurant week menu and the wine list. We ordered a modest bottle of Pinot Grigio. He then came back with a platter of warm breads and eggplant salad, it was a good starter.We then chose Frito Misto (fried calamari, shrimps, zucchini, fennel and sage) and pizza Salsiccia, with sausage, broccoli, rabe and chili flakes we found the Frito Misto more appetizing and the pizza fell flat on flavor and we needed to put salt and pepper.For our main entrees We selected the the seafood pasta called Spaghetti Schizzetto and the Branzino Ala Griglia, the dishes came in timely fashion and at no point did not feel that we were being rushedOver all, however, the staff are amazing the dining al fresco is really romantic, the dishes didn't really make a mark on us.

20958,"Title: A No-Frills Noodle Haven Next to Baruch College

If you find yourself craving noodles in the east 23rd area, Jimmy's is the go-to spot. Nestled on the same block as Baruch College and conveniently adjacent to If Cha bubble tea shop, this compact eatery offers a straightforward menu that's perfect for a quick, satisfying lunch.

I'm a regular here, particularly for their hearty hot beef noodle soup, which never disappoints. While the fish soup is a solid choice for smoked fish fans, it's the beef noodle soup that keeps me coming back. It's a filling option, albeit lighter on the veggies than some other places.

Prices are reasonable for the location, and while seating can be a bit cramped, it's a small price to pay for the convenience and quality. Bonus: you can grab a bubble tea from If Cha without leaving the restaurant. They accept both cash and card, but bring cash to avoid the tax.

Just a heads up: there's no bathroom on-site, so plan accordingly. Overall, Jimmy's is a worthwhile stop for a quick and tasty noodle fix. Bon appetit!",1
14303,"Title: A Homey Haven at Scallywag's NYC

Walking into Scallywag's felt like returning to a familiar, welcoming home right in the heart of NYC. The atmosphere buzzed with fun and friendliness that made us instantly remember why we had fallen in love with the place before. A special shoutout is warranted for the 'Yelp Fireball'—an unexpected delight that only added to our warm reception.

Both the hostess and the bartender deserve applause for their convivial manners, making us not just enter but also encouraging us to linger longer than intended. Scallywag's had us covered for a relaxed evening with their excellent happy hour selection and a draft list that nailed every preference.

In short, if you're looking for a spot that makes you feel at home with great drinks and even greater hospitality, Scallywag's should definitely be on your go-to list in NYC.",1

It's a good deal for $9 to $10. I opted for chicken pad see ew and chicken tom ka soup. The soup is creamy yet tangy. A great way to get the appetite going. The salad is basic but I love the peanut dressing. The pad see ew was also very good and filling!",0
11690,"I got their grilled BBQ wings in small portion and they were decent! The sauce was tasty and the wings were pretty big! Even though I ordered wings, it also came with drumsticks which confused me but I'm not complaining! I just took my order to-go and my food came out very quickly. I know that they are known for their rotisserie chicken, so I would definitely remember this place if I'm ever craving it.",0
10874,"I had heard about how long the wait can be here, but this is one of the newer locations so we actually had no wait when we went here for dinner! I absolutely couldn't pass up on getting one of their famous shakes. I got the churro choco taco and omg let me tell you amazing heaven is!! I haven't had a choco taco in years and this brought back so many nostalgic memories! The sides were covered in Cinnamon Toast Crunch held in place by frosting. This was absolutely the best shake I have ever had. Aside from the shake, we also got their brussel sprouts which came with this amazing sauce that I wish I could have with my brussel sprouts back home all the time. I also got a veggie burger and fries and that was the death of me. I thought... well heck with it, I'm not always in New York and I'm trying everything I want! So I forged through my dinner and felt like death at the end of the night. But it was an amazing death that I would do 1000x over! To be honest, the burger was nothing to write home about. But everything else? I would eat everyday if I didn't care about becoming diabetic, having a heart attack, and becoming bedridden shortly.",0
210,"Title: A Delightful Dim Sum Brunch in NY

I recently experienced a delightful brunch at a dim sum restaurant in New York and it was a joy for a dim sum enthusiast like myself. We arrived at 10:30 am on a Saturday and were seated immediately, though the place quickly became bustling.

The array of dishes we sampled was impressive, with highlights including the succulent shrimp dumplings, flavor-packed soup dumplings, and the deliciously savory chashu buns – my personal favorite. The sheer variety of our selections, like the shumai, sticky rice, and delectable desserts, left me thoroughly content.

A slight hiccup in the service, attributable to the restaurant's busyness, meant we occasionally struggled to catch the attention of the staff. Thankfully, my friend's fluency in Chinese eased the ordering process, though this could pose a challenge to non-Chinese speakers.

Be prepared for Hong Kong-style communal seating, which might mean sharing a table with others if you're in a small group. This didn't detract from the experience and might even add to the authentic ambience.

All things considered, this dim sum spot is a must-visit in NY. Excellent food, vibrant atmosphere, and just a touch of service improvement needed. Solid 4 stars!",1

The food was a bit of a let down since simple items like the egg sandwich & cinnamon rolls were over priced but not as flavorful as we had hoped it would be. The brunch menu is very limited so you have to be ok with a small menu.",0
15997,"Title: Business Lunch Bliss at Scarpetta

I recently had the pleasure of dining at Scarpetta for a business lunch and was thoroughly impressed. The interior is striking, adorned with an abundance of plants hanging from the ceiling, creating a refreshing atmosphere.

We opted for the pre-fixe lunch deal at $32, which was excellent value considering the quality and quantity of food served. The portions struck the right balance – substantial without being overly heavy for a midday meal. The standout feature was unquestionably the bread basket. A diverse selection of fresh bread accompanied by three delectable dips proved irresistible and was unanimously enjoyed by the table.

My yellowtail appetizer was a winner, and the branzino main course did not disappoint. While I didn't try the pasta this time, it's on my list for a future visit. We concluded with cookies and coffee for dessert, which was a delightful end to the meal.

The buzz about Scarpetta even spread to social media, where friends inquired about the ""BEAUTIFUL"" restaurant featured in my Instagram story. Whether you're planning a date or a business meeting, Scarpetta comes highly recommended for an ambience and dining experience that will impress.",1
2717,This is not your average Thai place. It was designed with communal eating in mind so everything from the tables to the way you order encourages sharing.You won't find pineapple fried rice or pad thai on this menu. Instead there are lots of very unique dishes. You can order each a la carte but they also have an option where you can order 2 dishes for $22 per person but everyone at your table has to participate. I was there with my boyfriend and we did this and got 4 dishes. I went for the non-spicy options and he picked some that only had 1 chili pepper rating so I wouldn't get destroyed. It turns out that I liked the spicy options way better! The Crabmeat Tom Tumeric had a creamy base of curry and coconut milk which was great on the rice. It was all chunky crab meat in the middle - no filler. There were a few bits of translucent shell so I'd watch out or those. My other favorite was the Panang Beef Curry which was only mildly spicy. The beef was alright but it was really the sauce that made the dish amazing. I couldn't help dipping everything into that curry. The other two dishes we got were meat heavy. Both meats (pork belly and beef short ribs) were tender and flavorful. They both tasted like what you would expect from their flavoring which wasn't a bad thing. I just really preferred the other two dishes.,0

I rarely say this, but this restaurant deserves more than the maximum stars. From the get-go, the service was stellar, setting the stage for an unforgettable meal. I opted for the Beef Pad Thai, which was flavorful and satisfying, although the beef was a tad on the tough side, which was surprising given the large pieces. But that's a minor quibble. The speed of service was impressive—our dumplings appeared almost as soon as we ordered, with the main courses hot on their heels. The staff was the epitome of friendliness and efficiency. If only they were as prompt with the water refills, it would have been perfect. Nevertheless, I'm already looking forward to my next visit. Highly recommend!",1

The menu seemed perfect for happy hour enthusiasts, brimming with tempting selections—I'm already planning my return for their much-raved-about tacos and margaritas. Additionally, the 25% off Yelp check-in discount on a $30 purchase is a steal.

I opted for a chicken burrito to-go during lunch. The service was commendable, with staff eagerly assisting with my order. The burrito came well-stuffed with rice, corn, sour cream, and chicken, accompanied by a refreshing side salad. While the size left a bit to be desired in terms of satiety, the taste did not disappoint.

Then when we were checking out, one of the hostesses was greeting a group that came in and told them that if they walked out, she would ""chase them down."" I get it. You don't want people to pull a dine and dash, but her tone came out more threatening and aggressive than it probably needed to be. It made me uncomfortable just hearing her say it to first comers. The other hostess also made an error on our bill. My friend and I had 2 separate cards since we were planning to pay separately for what we ordered. For some reason, the hostess combined our bills from the 2 separate cards together. When trying to fix the error, she made it sound like it was our fault that we weren't paying together. Besides the subpar service, the food here is actually pretty good and fairly priced. The venue is nice and spacious with wireless chargers everywhere.",0

Last night's rainy escapade led me to what could be my new favorite eatery in New York City. From start to finish, I indulged in an extravagant culinary journey, unable to resist the allure of the fresh, flavor-packed dishes parading out of the kitchen.

Regrettably, my ravenous state meant no photographic evidence of the standout sushi offering; however, the memory of the tuna avocado roll remains vivid. The tuna was like butter, seamlessly blending with rice that struck an ideal balance in texture.

The bao, which I did manage to snap a picture of, were nothing short of divine. A flawless bun encased a mouthwatering filling that more than satisfied my taste buds. Meanwhile, the grilled octopus stood out, tender and expertly seasoned, devoid of any expected chewiness.

In sum, the experience was nothing short of extraordinary, justifying every penny spent. This is a spot I'll undoubtedly revisit for another round of impeccable dining.",1

Among our selections were the fiery Larb moo – delicious but not for the faint of heart –, succulent beef skewers sweetened with a hint of coconut, and an intriguingly sour catfish soup that tantalized the taste buds. The papaya salad, pad Thai, and fried chicken rounded out the meal, each dish consistently good in its own right. The variety is a definite draw, and the distinctive flavors of each dish made for a memorable meal. I am already planning my next visit to delve deeper into their diverse offerings. Highly recommend for those seeking to experience the bold flavors of Thai cuisine.",1

Even though there was a seemingly generous  portion of seafood, the overall flavor was bland. Somehow, it didn't fill me up at all. I think because the sauce was very watery to me and needed to have a creamier and more flavorful texture to really wow me. Also maybe there just needed to be more pasta or something because I remember going for a lunch around 12 and then already being hungry again 1-2 hours later.",0

I don't love them but like I said, I had high expectations and am a tough critic. This is the second time I've had King David Tacos and honestly they just seen a little overpriced for what they are. I get that we are in New York not Texas, but it's hard for me to buy a tiny taco for $3.50. In San Antonio's, this taco would be 99 cents during early bird hours and $1.50 during other times. The tortillas aren't great and they do weird (to me) things like add beans to an egg and cheese taco. I sort of feel like I could make an equally good taco at home. I like what they are doing and hope they'll offer other types of tacos down the line that I like more. These are not San Antonio style tacos.

20760,"I love going to Cajun Sea for cocktails and placeto catch up with friends. The ambiance is so relaxed, music volume is enough to enjoy talking to friends ans enjoy the food. I am only deducting one star because the price is a little high for the amount of food you get.",0
16958,"Bobo, a previously overlooked gem in my routine walks, proved to be a delightful dining experience. The visit kicked off with a perfectly crafted margarita, followed by irresistible beet chips. The homemade potato gnocchi was a testament to the kitchen's prowess. Main courses, including the trout almondine and duck leg confit, satisfied with their robust flavors, while the roasted asparagus complemented the mains well.

Dessert was a medley of tastes, with the coconut and apricot sorbets falling short of my expectations. However, the salted caramel ice cream was a hit, and the lemon tart stole the show as the highlight of the evening. Service was impeccable, adding to the venue's enchanting ambience, complete with diverse dining spaces such as a charming covered garden. Bobo is undoubtedly a culinary delight worth repeating visits.",1
11575,"Came here for lunch during NYC Restaurant Week Winter 2019, and it was amazing. We made a reservation on a Tuesday afternoon and the restaurant was practically empty! It's pretty spacious inside and there are a lot of tables. We started off with bread as well as a complimentary appetizer (can't remember the name of it). The bread was so soft and the olive oil was delicious--the server brought two rounds!I ordered the Broccoli Sformato to start and the Orecchiette as my entree. I was debating between the Stracciatella alla Romana (soup) and the Broccoli, and I'm so glad I ended up going with the Broccoli. The server had described it as being like flan, so I had a tough time imagining broccoli-flavored flan, but the dish was soooo delicious. It literally melted in my mouth and the combination of flavors worked together perfectly. The Orecchiette was pretty good as well, but the pasta was cooked a little too firm... Ended up taking half of it home and it still tasted great as leftovers! I would love to come back for dinner and see what the restaurant looks like at night.",0

2115,"Title: A Lukewarm Introduction to Han Dynasty's Spice World

My foray into the bustling East Village to sample the Szechuan delights of Han Dynasty came with high expectations, fueled by a friend’s wing obsession. Alas, the dan dan noodles ($9) fell flat - a greasy, sparse, and lackluster affair, with none of the anticipated fiery kick. Likewise, the dumplings in chili oil ($8) drifted into the realm of the forgettable, failing to leave a lasting impression or live up to their spice potential.

However, the dry pepper chicken wings ($11) soared high above the rest, boasting a perfect crescendo of heat that lived up to my cravings - a dish worth a return visit or a spot on my delivery speed dial.

The venue hums with a vibrant energy, lit in a warmly inviting manner, offering a collection of Asian lagers that won't break the bank. Service was swift, a saving grace in an otherwise average dining experience.

In summary, while my inaugural visit didn't sweep me off my feet, the allure of those addictive wings and the promise of undiscovered gems will beckon me back to Han Dynasty's doors.",1
1055,"Title: A Slice of Heaven at the Pizza Promise Land

After finally visiting the acclaimed pizza spot I had bookmarked for ages, I can confidently say: endure the queue, it's worth it. Dare I say, this establishment ranks in my top three pizza experiences ever. Venturing from Houston for a weekend trip, my first taste here was nothing short of revelatory.

The Detroit-style pepperoni squares were a harmonious blend of crunchy and soft crusts, slathered with a zesty tomato sauce and crowned with peppery, crisped edges of thick pepperoni. Even without an appetite, I devoured two squares, convinced they were more than mere food—they were a euphonic delight.

The New York-style Margherita, a backup plan for my keto-following, New York-native wife, proved equally impressive. It captured the essence of the classic thin slice—crispy yet airy, with a melt-in-your-mouth melding of savory sauce, stretchy fresh mozzarella, and basil that added the final touch to this superlative pie.

Be prepared: patience is required, with a 20-minute wait being our mid-afternoon experience. The modest setting, with just enough space for a handful of patrons, meant enjoying our pizza al fresco from a takeaway box. Despite the bustle, the staff was amiable and worked with a precision mirroring their ovens.

In conclusion, if you're a pizza purist in search of your holy grail, this is it. Get in line, wait your turn, and get ready for a pizza epiphany that will redefine your culinary benchmarks.",1

15160,"Food: 4.5/5I've been going to this restaurant for years and it's always been one of my favorites. Located near the Canal Street stop, this restaurant is a gem in Little Italy. During my recent visit, I ordered mussels in red sauce as an appetizer, linguine vongole in white sauce and a spaghetti bolognese. They actually got the appetizer order wrong and gave clams in red sauce but it was pretty delicious. I was happy they made the mistake as I might have found a new go to dish! The clams were perfectly cooked and had a very generous amount of garlic. (I love garlic!) The linguine with white sauce was good but not the best. It tasted a bit bland and needed more salt. The spaghetti bolognese was amazing and made up for the linguine. It might have been the best bolognese sauce I've ever tasted! I would definitely recommend the bolognese!This restaurant is the only restaurant where the bread basket does not go to waste. Their bread is always perfectly baked and warm. It is served with a side of the most addicting olive oil/cheese/pepper concoction. I have a really hard time staying away from their bread.Service: 4.5/5The service here is always above par. There's so many restaurants in the area that these guys make sure you're treated like family. Everyone here is very friendly and professional. I've had one bad experience here during the summer but they seemed pretty understaffed that day. Ambiance: 4.5/5Cute little restaurant located on the corner. They have indoor and outdoor seating.

They made sure they were generous with it. So that gets them extra points.  Quick service. Fresh food. Five stars!,0
17132,"I've had really good dinner here, but it's a little pricy for what it is. The spinach artichoke dip is amazing and usually they'll give you more chips because there's never enough in the beginning.

The dressing on the salad is perfect and it is pretty filling. I would recommend coming here.",0

Ambiance and Setting: 3.5/5

Upon entering the restaurant, the welcome was less enthusiastic than expected, yet the seating process was swift due to our reservations. While the decor was tastefully executed, creating an inviting atmosphere with around 25 tables, the restaurant's proximity to a well-lit parking garage detracted from the desired sense of privacy.

Service: 3/5

Service quality was uneven; the bus staff was prompt and attentive, contrasting with our waiter's unremarkable presence post-order.

Menu and Cuisine: 3.5/5

The menu is concise, supplemented by daily specials. The linguine with white clams shone in pasta preparation and sauce, but the clams themselves underwhelmed, particularly given the premium cost and local availability of superior alternatives. The grilled pulpo appetizer, however, was a standout hit.

Desserts: 4.5/5

The dessert selection concluded the meal on a high note, specifically the tiramisu, which impressed with its airy texture, rich flavor, and striking presentation.

Value: 3/5

Pricing leans towards the expensive, with a dinner for four reaching nearly $350, including a modest selection of three glasses of wine. Portion sizes struck a median between ample and sparse.

Summary:

This restaurant offers a mix of hits and misses. While certain dishes like the grilled pulpo and tiramisu are exceptional, others, along with aspects of the service and ambiance, fall short. It's worth a visit for the highlights, as long as one is mindful of the price point.

21091,"Title: Great Value at Midtown's Burger & Lobster

I'm a regular at the Burger & Lobster in Flatiron, usually indulging in their $35 burger and lobster combo, which never disappoints. On a recent venture to their Midtown location for lunch during restaurant week, I found the smaller space to be quite appealing with tasteful decor.

For $26, the restaurant week special included half a dozen oysters followed by a lobster roll. The oysters, while decent, suffered a delay in arrival, hinting at a possible newbie at the shucking station. Nevertheless, the lobster roll redeemed the experience – it was buttery, well-filled, and did not skimp on the lobster.

True to form, Burger & Lobster delivered value for money, making the Midtown visit just as worthwhile as my usual dinner haunts. And yes, their butter garlic sauce remains a treasure – I’ll confess to eyeing my friend’s portion with envy. Whether for the combo or the restaurant week specials, this place is a solid choice for seafood lovers.",1

As you take the elevator up the pounding beat of music grows and explodes in your ears as the elevator opens. Ok, this is great if you are looking for lots of substandard drinks and a party atmosphere. The drinks are way overpriced and lacked taste. The guacamole and chips were very good and fresh. The share portion of Mac and cheese was delicious and the Quesadilla was tasty. So, food was a 4...drinks a 2 (unless you just want quantity)....atmosphere for a group ...4, atmosphere for an outdoor brunch with your daughter or a first date...try another place.

15389,"**Title: Fresh Flavors Meet Creative Twists at This BYOB Sushi Gem**

Last evening's dinner at the recently buzzed-about sushi spot in town turned out to be a delightful culinary adventure. The establishment takes pride in serving high-quality sushi, offering an impressive array of both inventive and classic flavor profiles. Their sauces and toppings are seasoned to perfection, making each bite both fun and delicious. Those with a preference for traditional sushi should note, however, that the seasoning is on the bolder side.

The fish's freshness was unmistakable, and it's no surprise since much of it is directly sourced from Japan. Two standout dishes that left a lasting impression were the Seared New Zealand King Salmon and the combination of sweet shrimp with caviar – both were simply sublime.

While the portions of rice were a tad smaller than what you might find in other omakase offerings across the city, the high-quality and taste of the fish more than compensated for this.

A major plus for this place is the BYOB policy, which not only makes the dining experience more affordable but also allows you to pair your meal with your personal favorite beverages.

In summary, if you're looking to indulge in some exquisitely seasoned sushi that's both fresh and innovative, look no further – just remember to bring your favorite bottle of sake or wine to complete the experience!",1
18252,"Title: A Thai Gem in the Heart of Manhattan

If you're looking for authentic Thai flavors in Manhattan, look no further. This gem of a restaurant not only boasts an enchanting ambiance with its striking leaf chandelier, but it also prides itself on a genuinely Thai menu that frequently introduces new temptations to delight regulars and newcomers alike.

Upon entering, the alluring scent of fish sauce promises an authentic culinary journey. The establishment expertly balances well-known American Thai favorites with a selection of exceptional, harder-to-find Thai dishes. Notably, their papaya salad transports your taste buds straight to Thailand, rivaling the Som Tom I've savored on my travels and standing out as a top contender for the best Thai salad citywide—second only, perhaps, to some hidden gems in Queens.

In summary, for those passionate about Thai cuisine, this place is a must-visit. Its combination of ambiance and culinary authenticity makes it a strong candidate for the best Thai experience in Manhattan.",1
11741,"Sine I was craving filipino food, I was very excited to come here. I came here on a Sunday evening around 8pm and was able to get seating right away. They do offer yelp reservations, so if you plan on going during a busier time I would look ahead to set your reservation. The place is decorated like a Jeepney (a bus in the Philippines) and has a variety of things that represent the Philippines. Their dinner menu is short, but they do offer a variety of specials each day.  We ordered the sigsig tacos, kare kare, and halo halo. The sigsig tacos were filled with a good portion of meat that was crispy and juicy. They topped off the tacos with a cilantro lime sauce that balanced all the flavors. Kare kare is a peanut soup - so watch out for those who have peanut allergies! The sauce was very creamy and the vegetables of green beans, eggplant, and baby bokchoy weren't overcooked. However we did find one undercooked eggplant. I just wish there was more oxtail in the dish. I was really excited for the halo halo! They had all the toppings from the jellies, jackfruit, plantain, flan, an ube dessert, and ube ice cream. It was cute how they topped it off with the Filipino flag. Overall, the prices were too pricey but I think in comparison to all the other Filipino restaurants in Manhattan this is baseline. I also wish the service was a little better - towards the end a large party came in and our server disappeared. I believe there was only one server working at the time we came in. I didn't get a chance to try their unique cocktail flavors which I would come back to try!",0
18139,"Yum yum yum. Suggest making a reservation as it gets pretty busy. We did feel a little packed in at the table we were at - we had to kind of move for another table to be seated next to us. The setup was a little weird and it was really busy and loud, but it was worth it for the food. Our waiter was also excellent. Overall I liked it and would come back, but only with a reservation. The pasta was tasty and cooked perfectly. We had the focaccia which should be the similar to the pizza, so I plan to come back and try to the pizza. The pesto that comes with the focaccia was so good - we had to hold ourselves from eating it all before our meals came. All the pasta is fresh and homemade. Food tips: Focaccia. Try one of the homemade pastas.",0
17468,"My recent visit to Mission Ceviche on the Upper East Side left a delectable impression. The host's warm welcome paired with the chic ambiance and the allure of an open kitchen set the stage for a memorable dining experience.

Our culinary journey began with the classic ceviche, which, unfortunately, was overwhelmingly acidic. The restaurant's accommodating service shone through as they promptly replaced it with the mixto ceviche—a harmonious blend of seafood that captured the essence of Peruvian zest.

Next, the octopus causas were a revelation, with the octopus prepared to tender perfection, complemented by the creamy texture of yellow potato and the bold flavor of chimichurri. The anticuchos of scallop followed, offering succulent bites so pleasing that I resolved to secure my own skewer on future visits to avoid the necessity of sharing these irresistible morsels.

Accompaniments like the yucca fries were a crunchy delight, and the meal reached its zenith with the seafood paella (Arroz con mariscos), presenting a medley of ocean treasures nestled in well-seasoned rice—an exemplar of coastal Peruvian cuisine.

Overall, the quality of the food at Mission Ceviche is indisputable. I recommend reserving a spot via Resy and, if possible, choosing a seat at the counter for an up-close view of the culinary magic. This eatery is not just a meal but a full-flavored experience.",1
15063,"Title: A Delightful Farewell Meal at Fred's Timeless Bar in New York

My dining experience at a charming 1910s-style bar in New York for our last meal before heading home was nothing short of exquisite. The atmosphere, adorned with mosaic tile floors and framed portraits of the eponymous Fred, was enhanced by the nostalgic touch of ""It's a Wonderful Life"" playing on black-and-white screens.

The Ahi Tuna, with its perfect coupling of avocado and seaweed salad, was a standout dish that impressed even our West Coast palates. It was, without a doubt, one of the finest renditions we've ever relished. Equally impressive was the chicken & waffle; its unique siracha-infused syrup had my husband raving, though he could do without the buttermilk gravy.

The turkey burger was a visual feast worthy of any Instagram feed, but it didn't just look good—its flavor lived up to its towering appearance. Finally, the deep-fried ice cream provided a lovely balance of texture and taste, not overly sweet but immensely satisfying.

I'm already looking forward to returning on my next New York visit, with a dinner and taste of their infamous cocktails firmly on the agenda.",1
126,"New Year's Eve at this venue promised a festive night, but it kicked off with a dampener as I, along with a modest queue of early birds, were kept waiting in the rain due to the ticket pick-up not opening until the advertised event time, despite instructions to arrive 30 minutes prior.

Upon entry, I received the standard red wristband for general attendees, which was slightly offsetting as I realized the bar offered no seating—just tables adorned with charming party favors. This prompted my upgrade to V.I.P. for an additional $40, a decision I don't regret as it afforded me the comfort of a table and seating, not to mention the inclusion of complimentary party bites like mini burgers, wings, and mozzarella sticks.

The bar served up strong drinks, and the staff proved to be warm and accommodating. That said, the evening's soundtrack left something to be desired for a hip-hop fan like myself, with a playlist heavily skewed towards pop and house tunes. All in all, while the night had its merits, including decent V.I.P. perks, it could have benefited from a more diverse music selection and better organization at the start.",1
21095,"Title: A Hip Spot with Hearty Flavors

Stepping into this lively eatery, the popping blend of old R&B and hip-hop with current tracks sets a vibrant atmosphere that's easy to enjoy. While the menu leans heavily on pork, limiting options for those with dietary restrictions, there are still some interesting picks.

I opted for the lamb sausage (merguez), which was a flavor-packed choice, albeit extremely oily and dense. The accompanying kimchi added a nice touch, though the dish overall could benefit from a lighter side to balance out the richness. At $25 for three pieces, it's on the pricier side and could definitely use a starchy accompaniment like bread for better value and digestion.

I sampled the rice, and although tasty, it was also a greasy affair, leading me to consume it sparingly. The real hit of the night were the shrimp shumai, which along with the selection of alcoholic drinks, were crowd-pleasers.

Mera's Eatery is a delightful place to let loose and have a good time; just make sure to enjoy the beats and indulge in some shumai. 

Mera's Tip: Come for the music, stay for the shumai, and maybe skip the heavier dishes.",1
15130,"Aunt Jake's is a cute little Italian-American restaurant, but I think the atmosphere here is more of a draw than the food. From the moment we walked in, the people who worked here were super friendly.  We were greeted, shown upstairs, and seated at a cute little table for two.  Our waiter seemed nice too but he left us without water for a while during our meal and was pretty busy whenever we tried to get his attention.  And even the nicest staff in the world can make up for not great food.  The pasta was weirdly chewy -- maybe because all of their pastas are homemade?  It's probably a personal preference thing, but I prefer my pasta al dente with less squish.  And unfortunately, the sauce wasn't a winner either.  My vodka sauce was more red than it was pink, and it was seriously lacking flavor. Aunt Jake's seemed like a local favorite for a casual date night or family meal.  But on a Saturday night, the restaurant was half empty, and that probably should have been a sign.  At $20 per plate for less-than-stellar food, I was bummed I picked this place for my Little Italy experience.",0
19359,"Title: A Mid-Afternoon Delight at a Bustling Thai Eatery

I popped into the restaurant at the sweet spot of 2 pm on a Saturday to dodge the notoriously long lines and the packed atmosphere. Success – I snagged a counter table, which, while not ideal, beats a lengthy wait.

Following the crowd's lead, I ordered the pork dry noodle, a hit among the regulars, and threw in a pad Thai for good measure. The flavors here are a cut above – striking that elusive balance that sidesteps the common pitfall of overly sweet and salty found in many Thai joints. Both the portion size and price point hit the mark.

While the counter does the trick for a quick meal, I'd recommend a table for a more leisurely dinner experience. It’s the perfect setting to dive into their appetizer and dessert menus. All said, whether you're in for a brisk bite or a full feast, this place has the knack for Thai flavors down pat.",1
19796,"Title: Spacious Setting, Great Service, but Food Falls Flat

I visited this restaurant on a quiet Monday night and was immediately struck by its expansive and immaculate interior. The staff was the embodiment of friendliness and attentiveness, setting a high bar for service from the moment I walked in. 

However, the dining experience was overshadowed by the food which, while not terrible, failed to leave a lasting impression. The menu's pricing felt steep considering the ordinariness of the offerings. Notably, staple accompaniments like rice or naan did not accompany the entrees, requiring additional purchases, which added to the feeling of the meal being overpriced.

On the upside, portions were generous enough to suggest entrees could be split between diners, and the garlic naan served alongside was truly scrumptious. The highlight of the meal was an unexpected complimentary puff pastry with cheese and peppers that was absolutely heavenly.

Of the two vegetarian entrees I tried, both were satisfactory but lacked the wow factor I had hoped for. In summary, while the service and ambiance are commendable, the food does not quite justify the price tag.",1
13646,"Title: Mixed Feelings at Barn Joo 35

Barn Joo 35, nestled in the heart of Midtown and a stone's throw from Port Authority and PATH, seemed like a Yelp treasure with its 4.5-star rating based on hundreds of reviews. This tapas-style Asian eatery initially set a promising tone with its solid drinks and inviting atmosphere.

However, the experience took an unexpected turn for the worse. The insistence on closing out our tab and signing the check mid-meal was not only unprofessional but also disruptive. It's vital for staff to recognize the importance of patience and respect for diners' experience.

Regarding the food, the crispy chicken wings were a standout, delivering a satisfying crunch with spot-on flavor, though their ""spicy"" wings lacked the heat some might expect. The vegetable dumplings disappointed, being rather indistinct in flavor. However, the crispy chicken buns redeemed the culinary experience and would tempt a repeat order.

In conclusion, if service hadn't tarnished our visit, a 4-star rating would be within reach. Despite the tantalizing dishes, the lack of professional service leaves me no choice but to cap my rating at 3 stars. Good food, yes, but the dining experience entails far more than what's on the plate.",1

17419,"Title: Lackluster Dining Experience at a Steakhouse

My recent visit to a local steakhouse with business colleagues was underwhelming. Seated in a booth at the back, we hoped for a quiet evening, but the inattentiveness of our waiter on a slow night was the first red flag.

The Caesar salad was the lone bright spot in our meal. We requested a larger Tomahawk steak to share, which was accommodated, but upon arrival, it was smaller than expected. Seeking an explanation about the sides, we faced communication issues and were puzzled by the unusual pairing of greasy bread rolls and cheese-whiz with our steak.

Most disappointingly, the steak itself was sinewy and tough, not living up to expectations for a good cut. Our selection of sides did little to elevate the dining experience, proving unremarkable across the board.

Due to poor service and unsatisfactory food quality, I cannot recommend this establishment and have no plans for a return visit.",1
14877,"Title: Another Satisfying Visit to Capital Grille

I recently returned to Capital Grille with my Australian friend after having a fantastic experience at their Midtown location, which my husband and I frequent for special occasions. We are dedicated fans of Capital Grille, having celebrated various milestones at their New Jersey and Garden City spots, and my Aussie friend has quickly joined the ranks of admirers.

What keeps drawing me back to this establishment is the consistently warm welcome and the professionalism of the staff, and this visit was no exception. Our waiter, Tim, provided impeccable service. We both opted for filet mignons of different sizes - my friend the 10 oz from the main menu and I the 8 oz from the lunch offerings. A minor mix-up with the steak orders was swiftly and seamlessly rectified by Tim, reflecting the well-trained staff and their aptitude for maintaining a hassle-free dining environment.

The succulent filet mignon, accompanied by grilled asparagus and delectable mushrooms, left us thoroughly content and ready to take on New York once more. And although my friend was keen for another steak encore the following day, we thought it best to savor the memory of our meal for a bit longer.

The food, ambiance, and service at Capital Grille are consistently top-notch. I'm already looking forward to my next visit - check out my salmon photo from the Midtown location to see why! This restaurant is truly a cut above, and I eagerly anticipate my next delightful meal here.",1
18878,"Title: A Festive Feast to Remember

My dining experience at this quaint little gem on Christmas Day was nothing short of delightful. Despite a reasonable 20-minute wait due to the holiday rush, the quality and pricing of the food were impressive. My dining partner and I ordered four dishes, though three would suffice for those with a lighter appetite. Standouts included the savory mock roast pork buns and my personal favorite, the snow pea dumplings, which had a unique, satisfyingly gooey texture. The rice flour roll with Chinese kale and the fried Napa roll were also bursting with freshness.

The flavors were on point, each dish tasting as if it were made with the utmost care. However, I must note that service did slip when one of our items was forgotten — an oversight I noticed occurring at other tables as well. A gentle reminder to the staff saw the issue promptly rectified. While this hiccup prevents a full five-star rating, the experience was still fantastic. Just remember to keep an eye on your order, and you're in for an exceptional dining experience. Overall, this place is a must-visit for anyone looking for delicious, well-priced fare in a cozy setting. Four stars!",1

So of course my FOMO kicked in, and convinced me that I, too, should stand in line for approximately 40 minutes.The pepperoni slice was damn good.

I recently dined at a fast food spot that has quickly become my favorite location of the chain. Surprisingly, the menu here boasts a wider selection than other outlets. The standout was indeed the pork bun, which was flavorful and satisfying without any need for additional heat. The tofu dish, another winner, managed to deliver on taste while being pleasantly mild. Both options represent excellent value for the money — a true bargain for the quality of flavor.

The restaurant itself is impressively clean, with ample seating to ensure a comfortable dining experience. Service was friendly, and the wait time for food was minimal. For anyone looking for a swift, delightful meal that doesn’t skimp on taste, I highly recommend this eatery.",1
21131,"I recently visited this restaurant with a friend for dinner, where we indulged in their seafood pot. The dish was particularly delectable, generously filled with a pleasing quantity of mussels. While the overall taste was satisfying, a greater variety of oysters and a more robustly flavored broth would have elevated the experience.",1
10877,"There are clearly a few lost Yelpers writing about the main El Vez restaurant on this page...this is just for the burrito bar!Been dying to try this weekday-day only spot for ages. I finally visited when I had a half day, and it didn't disappoint. My boyfriend built a delicious burrito, and I did the same with a rice bowl. Chocolate and horchata soft serve were also amazing. Wish they were open on weekends!",0
18463,"I recently ordered from this gem of a restaurant and was blown away by the flavors in their vegan offerings. The ""BLT+A"" sandwich was a delightful twist on a classic, oozing with flavors that complemented each other beautifully. The mac n cheese was creamy and comforting, just like the traditional dish, but with a vegan spin that didn't compromise on taste. The ""chikky fingers"" were a crispy, tantalizing treat that I couldn't get enough of. To top it off, their chocolate chip cookie was the perfect balance of chewy and chocolatey – a sweet end to a wonderful meal. An added bonus was the eco-friendly reusable bag that came with my Postmates order. It's heartening to see a restaurant that not only serves delicious food but also cares about sustainability.",1
14541,"Visited this charming eatery for their pizza, which did not disappoint—especially with the generous extra side of sauce complementing each slice perfectly.

Plenty of seating is available, ensuring a comfortable dining experience. Delicious food combined with friendly service makes this place a must-visit for pizza lovers.",1
14884,"Catch NYC embodies the vibrant essence of the Meatpacking district with a dining experience that's as audacious and spirited as its surroundings. The ambiance is exactly what you anticipate from such a locale: animated, opulent, and thoroughly enjoyable.

It's in their adventurous approach to culinary delights where Catch truly shines. The brunch selection dazzles with inventive creations, among which the Anytime Waffle Tower stands tall — quite literally. It's a whimsical behemoth of waffles and ice cream, layer upon decadent layer, promising not just a meal but an event. Each bite delivers on the promise of an extraordinary and scrumptious adventure.

In short, Catch NYC isn't just serving food; they are curating a festive gastronomic affair that's as delightful to the palate as it is to the spirit. A must-visit for anyone looking to indulge in the exuberant side of the New York dining scene.",1
2215,"This was a delectable pizza, and one of the few places in NYC we dined that was much like food in Seattle, scratch made and local.The pizza itself is like a half deep dish pizza, with toasted cheese edges that set it apart from any other pizza place.  My only issue was the homemade sauce was quite salty.  Even after having straight anchovies from the Caesar salad, the salt was too forward in the pizza sauce. The Caesar salad was quite delicious as well. The atmosphere was comfortable and quaint, and the waiters were down to earth and business, as we didn't want for anything or stay hungry for long. If I visit NYC again, I'll definitely go back, hoping someone eased up on the salt this time.",0
18562,"I really came here to try the hotpot. The pot is pretty big. You get a free order of noodles of you check in on Yelp. Being that I was fasting, I had a rather small appetite.I loved how sweet and nice the staff was. One time the waiter came by and asked if we wanted extra plates, I didn't understand why. Me and my friend already had separate plates. It's because of the oil that accumulates on your plate. Makes it too hot. So you can switch out plates periodically to avoid burning your mouth. Another time I asked for a spoon and the waiter brought out 3 different types of spoons because he didn't know which one I wanted. The waitstaff is so sweet and friendly, I swear I felt like family. They would stop by asking if everything was okay. Very polite and helpful.At the end of the meal you get orange slices. EVERY CHINESE RESTAURANT SHOULD ADOPT THIS PRACTICE. The sweetness from the orange cuts the spice from the food. It really helps soothe your mouth. The food wasn't so spicy that I couldn't enjoy the food. Really loved everything here. Definitely one of my favorite Chinese restaurants in NY. I will be back very soon.",0
11551,"Decided to check this taco place out after a long day.  Great walking distance from my hotel and very convenient.  I ordered to go, which was a quick and fast to go service.  Friendly workers with great atmosphere.  A lot of delicious food to choose from.  I ordered 2 carnitas, 1 chicken taco, and elote.  The tacos were excellent with great seasoning (i forgot to get hot sauce).   The elote was decent, it was a bit dry and wasn't anything too special.  I would skip on it. If you are in the area, make sure to check this place out!",0
13996,"Title: A Mixed Bag of Burgers with a Side of Warm Service

My Thursday night visit to this bustling eatery was a hit-and-miss affair, albeit with standout service throughout the evening. Upon arrival, the brief wait to be seated raised our expectations for a popular dining experience.

While the All American burger's reputation might turn heads, our encounter with its overly salty taste made it unremarkable, if not disappointing. In stark contrast, the onion rings accompanying it deserved applause for their perfect crunch and flavor.

A different tale unfolded with the Mexico City burger; this was a triumph of taste. It struck the right balance of zest and substance, with the pickled jalapeños imparting a welcome kick that elevated the entire dish.

Health-conscious diners will appreciate the option for gluten-free buns, an inclusive touch that didn't go unnoticed.

The meal concluded with a dive into their much-hyped milkshake menu. Though tempted by the cake shake, I opted for the Brooklyn Blackout. I found the shake itself pedestrian, but the over-the-top toppings are the real spectacle.

Service shone through as the consistent highlight of the night—attentive, friendly, and efficient.

In summary, while not every dish hit the mark, the combination of flavorful choices, dietary accommodations, and commendable service makes this spot worth considering for casual diners seeking indulgence with a side of comfort.",1
19372,"I recently dined at an Asian restaurant renowned for its authentic Szechuan cuisine, and it was a delightful experience. The ambiance of the venue was warm and inviting, perfectly complementing the bold flavors of the food. The standout dish of the night was unquestionably the pork belly doused in chili garlic oil; it was a symphony of taste that had me hooked from the first bite. Accompanying this were the jelly fish salad and shredded fried eel, both of which were scrumptious and packed a spicy punch, thanks to the liberal use of chili oil.

Take the servers' offer for water – you'll need it to handle the heat. The portions are generous, with some dishes large enough for family-style sharing, which is great for group dining. All in all, this is a spot that will have you returning with anticipation for those flavors that tickle your taste buds and leave you yearning for more.",1
20784,"I recently visited this restaurant and was pleasantly surprised by the quick service they offered. I decided to try the dumpling sampler, priced at $13.50, and was met with an array of really good dumplings. They were unexpectedly sticky and steamed, which presented a bit of a challenge for my chopstick skills.

Each dumpling in the sampler had its own unique appeal, although the pork and chive variety didn't quite hit the mark for me—it had an odd, potato-like texture inside. Despite that, the rest were delicious and satisfying, filling me up nicely.

I could've eagerly indulged in a few pork buns as well, if only time had permitted. Unfortunately, I was on a tight schedule and had to dash for the train. Regardless, it was a good dining experience and a welcome break in a hectic day.",1
16157,We stopped by while in the area after a friend recommend it for tacos. We snagged a small table in the back by the vw bus. Our server was friendly throughout our visit. We decided to each get a barbacoa and a pastor taco. I also went with a side of street corn. Our food came out quickly and it looked good.  I tried the esquites first and really enjoyed it. We tried the tacos next and they were both decent. We grabbed our check and were out fairly quickly. It worked well for a quick bite while waiting on friends.,0
13696,"Title: Quick, Flavorful, and Satisfying

I recently dined at this gem of a spot, perfect for those who are after a fast yet scrumptious meal. My choices were the Lamb Curry Naan and the Lamb Curry Bowl, both of which hit the mark on flavor. The dishes boasted a harmony of fresh ingredients, with the curry perfectly complemented by the crisp greens and aromatic garnishes. The naan bread deserves a special mention for its ideal combination of crispness and fluffiness.

Don't miss out on the green hot sauce for an extra kick – it's a game-changer! A word to the wise: seating is on the scarce side, and the ordering space is cozy. However, the efficient service means you won't linger long. In a brisk 20 minutes, we were out the door, fully satisfied. I'm already planning my next visit!",1
10440,"Title: A Seafood Haven Worthy of Repeat Visits

From the moment I stepped into this establishment, I knew it was going to be an exquisite experience, and indeed, it was nothing short of spectacular. The oysters, a mystery selection due to my memory lapse, were easily some of the finest I've ever indulged in, with 24 vanishing amongst three of us in a symphony of sea-kissed delight.

The lobster and shrimp dumplings were a revelation in flavor, delectable little parcels sent straight from Poseidon's pantry. As for the catch of the day, the halibut, it was executed to perfection – flaky, tender, and paired magnificently with sublime shaved mushrooms.

Compelled by the memory of that first visit, I found myself drawn back to this gem of a spot. The oysters once again did not disappoint, their briny charm a perfect encore. Exploring further, I savored the lobster tail and crab claws, each bite an ode to oceanic freshness. The Old Bay fries were a standout, delivering a spicy kick that complemented the seafood beautifully.

And the scallop entree? Divine indeed. Each scallop, a heavenly morsel, left an impression that will beckon me back for more.

In short, if seafood is your siren call, this place answers with an unequivocal A+. Prepare for your taste buds to set sail on a gastronomic voyage that will have you plotting your return as soon as you leave.",1
15548,"I recently had the pleasure of dining at a spot that serves up some delicious Taiwanese baos. Among the baos we sampled, the Birdhaus Bao and the Chairman Bao were standout favorites – both packed with flavor and leaving a memorable impression on my taste buds. Unfortunately, the Fried Fish Bao didn't quite hit the mark, coming across as rather lackluster in comparison to its counterparts. The only downside to the experience was the limited seating, which I hope the restaurant will address soon. Despite that, the baos are a must-try for anyone with a penchant for Taiwanese cuisine.",1

CONS: - cash-only establishment: Cash only IMPRESSION:Definitely a good bang for your buck located in Chinatown. The price is between $1.75 to $3.50 for an onigiri. They also have other baked goods (primarily savory options), for example a ""scallion dog bun"" which is for $1; it is basically hot dogs within a sweet bun with some butter that has been glazed on top so that the finely-chopped scallion garnish can adhere to the top.",0
12834,"I recently dined at this upscale and classy Korean BBQ spot, and my experience was quite remarkable. With impeccable decor that rates a perfect 5 out of 5, this restaurant exudes sophistication and style. 

I indulged in the marinated beef belly ssam, paired with a choice of stew for $42, and the marinated short ribs for $40 that were tenderly cooked right at our table. Although the portions were on the smaller side, the high quality of the meat justified the upscale price tag. The savory sauces enhanced the dishes, though a word of caution: the salty garnish can be overpowering if used too liberally. The beef belly ssam was particularly delightful, wrapped in lettuce with a variety of sauces, but it did lose its warmth rather quickly.

The tofu stew accompanying the ssam was underwhelming with scant tofu, and the mushroom bibimbap, priced at $17, was merely average. However, the standout banchan more than made up for it, with attentive refills upon request.

Overall, this spot scores a solid 4 out of 5 across the board for food, value, and service. While it might not be an everyday dining destination due to its prices, it's certainly a decent choice for a special treat. The environment and service were both exceptional, contributing to a pleasant dining experience.",1
20620,"Had the soup dumplings, fried dumplings and cold sesame noodle. Soup dumplings were the tastiest. They had a nice kimchi bite to them. Also, they weren't made so hot that they needed to sit for 20 minutes before being edible. Sooooo good.Cold sesame noodles were on point. High quality noodles and sesame taste came from using the right mix of soy sauce and sesame, not Jiffy. Listen, Jiffy is OK at home in a pinch but too many spots resort to this. Sweetness that never tastes authentic.Pan fried dumplings were third although this is not an insult. Texture was on point with the fried bottom and softer sides. Will return for sure.",0

I'd love to come back for dinner the next time I visit nyc. I took a peak at their dinner menu & it looks divine.",0
12576,"This place is gorgeous!!! Really transports you to a tropical place like Florida with the long curtains and breezy garden ambiance. It unfortunately falls short in the service. It's actually so annoying to see so many people working in a relatively slow hour (1pm on a Monday) and still taking a while to bring a condiment like parm cheese for the pasta. Our son spilled water on the table and it wasn't attended to until later when we were almost done. The orders were taken super slow... Everything was just taking forever. It took away from the experience. The food was ok. The mezza plate didn't make sense... it has tumeric eggs. It was like a salad with herbs and cheese and on another plate was hummus, babaganoush and a LOT of olives and this is coming from a person who loves olives. They also have to work on making a kids menu. How can they not??!! It's just so sad to see a nice place like this have terrible service. Nothing more annoying honestly.",0
19510,"I read some reviews on Open Table. They just aren't as reliable as Yelp. I love Italian food so when in NYC I always try to find a new spot to try. The menu and distance from my hotel both looked good.I was a single diner so I sat at the bar which was fine with me. It is a great bar in that people sit on both sides and the actual bar is on the wall if that makes sense. Good atmosphere. A little loud but not too bad.I started with the arancini which is a favorite dish for me. It was two large balls in tomato sauce and looked great. Unfortunately, they were a big bag of meh. Zero flavor and served lukewarm at best. I salted them but even that could not save these. I only ate one.I followed up with the beef carpaccio and again I was underwhelmed. The arugula was bitter as it should be, but there was zero balance with the dressing to add that touch of sour. The beef was good, but the shaved parm was so mild you wouldn't have guessed  it with your eyes closed even knowing  you were in an Italian restaurant.The saving grace was in the pasta I ordered. It was a simple dish of fusilli in pink sauce with sweet and hot sausage. It savored every bite along with a glass of Amarone. I skipped dessert and overall that pasta saved the evening. Tatiana was my server and she did a very good job. There was a host/manager who was very attentive. Fast service. Until that fusilli, this was at one, maybe two stars.",0

11855,"Title: A Delightful Surprise at Limani - A Midtown Gem

Having not attended an educational dinner in quite some time, I recently found myself at Limani in the heart of Rockefeller Center, thanks to a fortunate twist of timing. The restaurant's Yelp reviews set high expectations, which were met with a contemporary and cool aesthetic - a perfect blend of Miami and Midtown, as one Yelp friend aptly described.

Nestled in a private room downstairs, our fixed menu began with a delightful array of appetizers, including notably tasty Mediterranean dips and a pleasant surprise in the form of both rings and tentacles in the fried calamari. The eggplant chips were a hit, though they perhaps inconveniently masked another dip. The tomato-cucumber salad provided a fresh counterpoint to the starter spread.

My entrée, the salmon, was flavorful though not extraordinary - a slight nod to the limitations sometimes found during restaurant week experiences. However, the warm potato salad accompanying it elevated the dish wonderfully.

Dessert did not disappoint, with an offering of fruit with Greek yogurt, alongside flaky, sweet baklava and walnut cake - a satisfying end to our culinary adventure.

Service was attentive without being intrusive, maintaining a pace that complemented the dining experience seamlessly.

In conclusion, Limani served up an impressive selection for an educational dinner. While there are no immediate plans for a revisitation on my calendar, Limani has secured its spot as a strong contender for future dining endeavors in Midtown.",1
2772,"Title: A Bold Flavor Adventure at Local Indian Eatery

My latest culinary venture led me to a no-frills Indian spot with the charm of a banquet hall and the straightforward appeal of fast-casual dining. Think Indian Chipotle—you're greeted by a warm glass case full of vibrant offerings, from the classic chicken tikka masala to a hearty lamb curry, all the 'heavy hitters' of Indian cuisine are present.

The food? It's downright addictive. The standout for me was a decadent spinach side reminiscent of creamed spinach, but with the rich, complex spices you'd expect from authentic Indian fare. And don't get me started on the naan—fresh, with the perfect balance of softness and chew, it's an absolute must-have.

A word to the wise: this place serves up flavors so bold, you might find it wise to clear your afternoon plans. Some might say the food is not for the faint of heart—or stomach—so consider yourself part of an adventurous culinary experience.

All caution aside, the experience was wonderful. For those with a penchant for rich, flavorful food and a sense of adventure, this spot is a gem. I'll surely be back the next time the craving for Indian cuisine hits. It's an understated establishment where the food truly speaks for itself.",1
21125,"Title: A Fusion Feast with Hits and Misses at Mama Sushi

Mama Sushi, a spot that’s been stirring buzz with its Dominican-twisted sushi creations, called me in on a quiet weekday. I dove straight into the Tres Golpe sushi - a quirky roll that surprisingly mirrored the classic breakfast dish with plantains, salami, cheese, and a pop of purple onion. It was a delightful meld of culture and cuisine.

However, the restaurant's adventurous spirit didn't quite hit the mark with the Conuco roll. Promising a seafood adventure, it fell flat with its dry texture and a lack of the savory punch I was craving, even with dipping sauces at hand.

Redemption came in the form of La Chiapadora. Each bite of the tender chicken wrapped in sushi rice was a testament to the seamless fusion of Asian and Dominican flavors, hitting all the right savory notes.

In all, Mama Sushi is an experience - a culinary roller coaster with peaks that tantalize and troughs that serve as mild disappointments.",1
10189,"Title: Affordable Fare Leaves Room for Taste Improvement

Upon visiting this budget-friendly eatery, I was immediately struck by the unbeatable prices, yet it quickly became evident that the adage ""you get what you pay for"" was applicable. The Chive and Pork Fried Dumplings, attractively priced at $1.25 for five pieces, were passable but failed to make a lasting impression, deserving a middling 2.5 out of 5. Meanwhile, the Scallion Pancake, costing only $1.50, was a letdown as it was overly thick and lacked the expected flavorful scallion presence, resulting in a mere 2 out of 5 rating. Overall, this restaurant might be kind on your wallet but could stand to dial up the flavor.",1

I highly highly recommend the fried calamari.For main course, I had the beef Penang curry and it was good, exactly what you expect. However I did like the fried snapper and the clay pot catfish.

Probably would have been better if they weren't sitting in my car as I drove home in rush hour but when I bit into the crunchy baguette, it didn't matter. The bread was pretty good. I liked the Red Eye Banh Mi more than the more traditional pork belly because of the flavors. I thought the BBQ Belly Banh Mi could have had more spice. Overall pretty good place for lunch if you are around the area.",0
13066,"As a connoisseur of unique culinary experiences, I had to check out this local gem, renowned for being one of the few, if not the only, dipping ramen spots in the city. The experience did not disappoint, primarily due to the exceptionally thick and creamy broth that paired delightfully with the chashu. The meat was the star of the dish, featuring a level of fattiness that ensured a melt-in-your-mouth sensation, a true testament to the chef's expertise in crafting flavors and textures. However, the experience was slightly marred by the noodles, which, while not unpleasant, simply did not resonate with my palate as I had hoped. They didn't detract from the overall enjoyment but were not the highlight for me. Nonetheless, the establishment certainly stands out for its signature offerings and is worth a visit for any ramen enthusiast looking for something out of the ordinary.",1

13531,"Title: A Delightful Meal After a Long Fast

Review:
After fasting for the day, my appetite was unabated as I entered a lively room buzzing with conversation, though noticeably absent of music. The service shone brightly with attentiveness; my waiter, empathic to my overdone lamb, cheerfully compensated with aromatic Turkish coffee and syrupy baklava.

The food experience began on a high note with warm bread, a simple pleasure that never disappoints when paired with olive oil. The eggplant salad was a standout, bursting with seasoning that accentuated its freshness. Accompanying my lamb were the calf liver offerings, fried to perfection and intelligently paired with pickled cabbage—a zesty companion that sliced through the oiliness with its tang.

The centerpiece, lamb chops, though well-seasoned and enjoyable with its rice and greens, fell short of perfection due to an overstep in cooking. A medium-rare promise yielded a well-done reality; nevertheless, the meal was satisfying.

In sum, the restaurant delivered a savory respite to my hunger, with warmth in both cuisine and service that almost made me forget the slight misstep in the preparation of the lamb.",1
12092,"Wanted to try a branch (there are a few) of Fournos from the first time I walked past one on Seventh Avenue, because I am all in when it comes to Greek food.  We walked across 45th St. the other day at the perfect time to take a pastry and coffee break!So many choices! From sweet to savory, Greek faves are here. You order at the counter, take your food to a table (several on the main floor, more upstairs).Husband and I shared a generously sized square of galaktoboureka (sp?), a sweet Greek custardy confection - we first tasted this while in Athens about 10 years ago and loved it.  This was a little different, with a crust more like the shredded wheat of a kataifi, and it was soooooo good!  We each had a good, strong,  Americano that perfectly complemented the sweetness. Couldn't resist buying a slice of spanakopita to take home, 2 choices of crust, we took the phyllo.  Heated in the toaster oven later, excellent!Not sure I'd have dinner here, I prefer real dishes and table service for dinner, but a casual lunch, absolutely!  People around us were eating delicious-looking mains, gyros (big thing here on correct pronunciation  - 'yeero') and such.Definitely a repeat place. BTW, a little thing I liked was that the ambient music was more Greek-sounding. I am just rubbed the wrong way when an ethnic restaurant plays American pop, hip hop, whatever.  Go cultural, give us diners a somewhat more authentic experience!",0
13760,"Walking into this hidden gem in Chinatown, you might second-guess your choice, given its hybrid DVD store-deli appearance. But trust me, press on towards the food counter to the right and prepare to be blown away. The banh mi is a steal at under $6, generously stuffed with all the authentic fillings you'd hope for – a clear indication that it's the food, not the frills, that they care about. It's cash-only, which fits the casual vibe of the area, and seating isn't an option – this is a grab-and-go spot. Each visit, I can't shake the feeling of getting away with highway robbery, considering the quality and price. Simply put, this place is all about the eats, and it's a marvel they're still in business with prices this good.",1

Last night at the new Pastis proved to be an unforgettable dining experience, even on a bustling Tuesday. Promptly seated at our reservation time, the trendy Meatpacking crowd and energetic ambiance set the stage for the night. While the minimalist wooden furniture could benefit from a comfort upgrade, this was a minor detail overshadowed by the culinary delights.

The meal commenced with an impeccable crab and avocado dish, hitting all the right notes for a summer evening. My main course featured succulent sea scallops, cooked to perfection, and paired with a delectable sauce and asparagus. Dessert was the pièce de résistance: a generous blueberry tart, or tarte sable à la myrtille, with a luscious cream and crisp base that would satisfy any blueberry aficionado.

Service was friendly and efficient throughout the evening, complementing the superb dining experience. Prices felt appropriate for the quality and location. Pastis left me eagerly anticipating a return, possibly for brunch next time!",1

The shrimp was small already but was cut up further in smaller pieces. The salmon would have been okay except for the strong wasabi taste that was all throughout the bowl. I could not even identify the wasabi as it was blended in without a trace and could not be separated from the food. I had to pick 5 mix ins (there is a limit of 5 in total) and chose items such as cucumber, seaweed, tomatoes, and masago. The cucumber was surprisingly sliced and not diced, which I did not find standard. Furthermore, the sushi rice I asked for in my bowl was mistakenly replaced with salad. There's a small charge if you wish to use your credit card, so it's recommended to use cash. My personal recommendation is to steer clear of the place until there are improvements made.",0
2259,"Title: A Hidden Gem for Broadway Goers - The Brazen Tavern

If you're seeking a delightful culinary escape just a stone's throw from Times Square without the typical Midtown mayhem, The Brazen Tavern is your sanctuary. Nestled conveniently near Broadway, this unassuming spot is ideal for a pre or post-show meal that won’t break the bank.

The Brazen shines with its superior take on pub classics. Forget everything you thought you knew about bar food; the menu here is a testament to quality. Their mouthwatering mac n' cheese, irresistible nachos, and zestful fish tacos convert skeptics into devotees. After enduring the epic 'The Ferryman', their fish tacos—bursting with flavorful shrimp, crisp slaw, and a kick of spicy mayo—were nothing short of a culinary curtain call.

While the homemade Veggie Burger, perfectly cooked Grilled Salmon, and NYC-cart-rivalling Soft Pretzels are all menu standouts, the fish tacos remain the star of the show.

Even as a non-drinker, I can appreciate the vast selection of beer and seasonally inspired mojitos and sangrias for those looking to imbibe. And if you enjoy a good people-watching spot, The Brazen's outdoor seating on a balmy evening offers the perfect backdrop—though be prepared for a lively, yes, I'll say it—brazen atmosphere.

For high-quality eats at a reasonable (by Midtown standards) price, The Brazen Tavern deserves a spot on your Broadway dining rotation.",1
13809,"Title: A Cozy Spot for Americanized Thai Delights

If you're on the hunt for a quaint location serving Americanized Thai cuisine in a laid-back atmosphere, this little gem should be on your radar. I visited on a bustling Saturday night at 7:30 PM, and my party had no trouble securing a table. What stood out was the cordiality of our waitresses and the BYOB option, which let us pair our own wine with the meal.

For starters, we indulged in Thai dumplings, chicken satay, and Brussels sprouts - each dish making a delightful impression, particularly the standout chicken satay that eclipsed its counterparts in other Thai establishments. Our main course consisted of a shared selection: green curry fried rice, a savory chicken and veggie plate, and the deeply flavored short rib curry. While all dishes satisfied, the curry was the definite highlight.

The service was unhurried; we lounged for over two hours, reveling in conversation and the flavors on our table. As for value, the meal was remarkably wallet-friendly, marking this spot as an unbeatable choice for anyone after a casual, tasty, and economical dining experience in this part of town.",1
1803,"Restaurant Review: A Dive into Spanish Delights with a Pinch of Disappointment

Last night's experience at the much-raved-about Spanish tapas bar left me with an array of flavors, but also a thirst for a better drink. Boasting a 50 pp chef's tasting menu, I embarked on a gastronomic journey, poised for a delight with every dish, though I was met with a slightly bitter sip at the outset.

The short version? The food was exceptional, while the drinks lagged behind.

The 'shishito margarita', anticipated to be a fiery dance of spice and zest, turned out to be overwhelmingly sweet—lacking the anticipated punch. However, let's pivot to the plethora of positives.

Service was impeccable, setting a high note for the night. The eggplant dip with pita was a symphony of flavor, and the lamb skewer? Succulent and perfect without the accompanying bread. The cheese platter presented a well-curated variety, and alongside it, a cured meat and prosciutto platter with fries marched in, pleasing the charcuterie aficionados.

A standout was the mixed grill, featuring hanger steak, house-made chorizo, and a medley of fries, garlic allioli, a hazelnut component I couldn't quite pinpoint, and salsa verde. The patatas bravas were a cheesy, potato-y masterpiece, appealing to the universal love for the two.

The BRÓCOLI CON AJO BLANCO stole the show with a concoction of roasted broccoli, almonds, raisins, and mint—a true testament to the power of vegetables. Although the beet salad (ENSALADA DE REMOLACHA Y PEPINO) didn't resonate with my taste buds, the garlic shrimp certainly did. The baked mushrooms with cheese provided a comforting bite, and to top it all off, Nutella and 'dulce something' churros concluded the meal on a high and sweet note.

This spot shines when visited with a group. The decor boasts a lively Barcelona ambiance that pairs well with the tapas tradition. Despite the misstep with the margarita, I'd return for the food alone. Cheers to the chefs, and here's hoping the bar catches up soon!",1
12667,"I recently dined at an exceptional restaurant that truly wowed me with its value and culinary craftsmanship. Offering an extensive 17-course menu for just $125, it was an epicurean adventure worth every penny. Standouts included the rich and creamy uni, a sublime uni wagyu, the flawlessly seared toro, and succulent crab. The live scallop, freshly opened before your eyes, was a memorable treat, enhanced by a delicate touch of caviar that graced several dishes.

Currently operating on a BYOB basis due to a pending liquor license, guests comfortably brought their own bottles of wine to complement the meal. The service was impeccable, contributing to a thoroughly enjoyable experience. It's worth noting that reservations are a must here; even on a Thursday night, the place was packed to the rafters.

A thoughtful touch that didn't go unnoticed was the special piece prepared for my friend's birthday, a testament to the restaurant's attention to detail and customer care. I'd hurry back in a heartbeat.",1
17411,"Hands down the best Thai spot I've tried so far. This place was a bit of a hassle to get into, but what isn't in NY that's good? So I don't get what people fuss about. So it says you can't make reservations but I swear I heard them say certain people did, so not sure about that. Being that this spot is only open 5:30-10:30, we showed up at 5:15 and there was already a wait to get in. Upon getting to the front we were told seats were full and the wait would be about an hour and they would text us and we would have 10 min to arrive. Fine by us! We just went to the bar next door to have a drink. Anyhow, on to the food and experience. This spot is dimly lit, very dimly lit in fact where you can barely see the pics of my food. But oh boy is the food worth it! They be blasting Thai music so it can be a bit of hard hearing. And like most places in NY, this place is crammed in. So be prepared to get comfortable with others. For drinks we tried their very own uncle boons Thai beer which had a kick to it but was pretty good. Tasted like an ipa with spice! I couldn't have more than one glass and switched to Thai tea. If you're like me and like it sweet sweet, make sure to ask for more of the condensed milk on the side. Theirs is not sweet which is fine for those who don't like too much sweetness! Also, I just want to point out, service was impeccable. Always makes a big difference. Food was delicious! We started with the betel, then tried the scallops followed by the bone marrow and last but not least the Khao Soi. Literally perfect. All of it. We also had the coconut ice cream to finish off. The seasonings, the texture and taste of it all mixed perfectly. I won't dish too much on the flavor of it all but if you live in NY or are like me and just visiting, I would highly recommend this spot!!",0
13965,"Title: A Disappointing Experience at Chocolat due to Poor Management 

My visit to Chocolat was marred by a significant lapse in management that left me thoroughly dissatisfied. Having reserved a table for a client event well in advance, I was dismayed to find the arrangements in disarray upon arrival. Despite explicit instructions provided to manager/event coordinator Christina about our group's needs and my plan to bring a celebratory cake and cupcakes, it became clear during a subsequent confirmation call that the reservation details had not been properly recorded.

On the day of the brunch, which had been downscaled from 18 to 15 guests, several unwelcome surprises awaited. Firstly, Zekia, the hostess, informed me of unexpected cake and cupcake fees, then insisted the entire party had to be present before we could be seated. Most distressing was the discovery that we were assigned to the semi-private room featuring low stools and tables – a setting I had specifically vetoed due to its unsuitability for our senior guests.

These oversights caused considerable stress, as guests had begun to arrive. It was all the more frustrating with Christina absent, leaving no opportunity to address these issues with the person responsible. While hostess Zekia and waiter Alex went out of their way to accommodate us, their exemplary service could not fully mitigate the organizational failings.

I believe effective management directly reflects on a restaurant's reputation, and Chocolat's failure in this regard has unfortunately influenced my decision to not patronize them in the future.",1
11339,"One of the best korean bbq restaurants in ktown!! They don't play around here. From the food to the interior design they hit all 5 stars from me. The meat was extremely flavorful from whatever awesome marinade they do. If you're looking for an alcoholic drink to pair the kooksoondang rice wine is perfect. I can't really describe how well it tastes with the bbq you just have to try it. All I can say is it cuts the fattiness and balances out the flavor in my opinion.The service is also very fast and responsive. The interior design reminded me of a place you'd see in Korea. The oak wood and the style of the metal grate. If friends and fam ask me what kbbq place they should go if they visit NYC, no doubt in my mind I would say Jongro.",0

Choose from ham, sausage, or bacon egg and cheese; whether you opt for a bagel or a roll, I recommend getting it toasted. Also worth noting is the $5 credit card minimum. While they have a range of lunch options like salads, sandwiches, and burgers, it's their breakfast that keeps me coming back.",1
2590,"At first glance, this unassuming spot may not catch your eye, but trust me, it houses some of the best dumplings you'll find in NYC. A word to the wise—arrive before their early closing time. I swooped in at 10:29 PM and barely secured the last order of veggie dumplings. This place is not only top-notch but also easy on the wallet. A friendly reminder: this is a dumpling haven, so prioritize their namesake dish over anything else. For noodle cravings, go elsewhere; here, dumplings are the way to enlightenment.",1
14210,"Against my better judgment, I finally ventured into the much-hyped Chinatown haunt I've skirted for years, lured by the promise of a solid xiao long bao amidst fewer local options. Our timely arrival at opening granted us the lunch special bounty. The soup dumplings did indeed live up to their reputation—savory little pockets of joy in each bite. Yet, the rest of the meal failed to match this high note. The lo mein lacked depth, the ribs flirted with greatness but ultimately fell short, and the accompanying egg roll and rice were forgettable add-ons. In a neighborhood teeming with culinary treasures, the solo success of their soup dumplings isn't enough to warrant a return visit from me. There are rivals offering not only exceptional xiao long bao but also a parade of other standout dishes to satiate a more comprehensive craving.",1
10156,"My friend and I visited this restaurant on a calm Wednesday evening at 5:30 PM. Initially, the place was quite empty, but by the time we left at 7:30 PM, it was bustling with patrons. The ambiance struck us as quiet and romantic, with a spacious layout that really set the scene for a delightful dining experience.

To start, we indulged in a trio of appetizers: the burrata, chickpea fries, and brussels sprouts. The burrata stole the show as a flawlessly fresh and quintessential summer dish. The chickpea fries were a delightful surprise, boasting a crispy exterior with an unexpectedly creamy interior reminiscent of mashed potatoes. The brussels sprouts, however, were merely satisfactory in comparison.

Our main courses included shared plates of duck breast and steak. Unfortunately, both meats fell short of our expectations, being tougher than anticipated. The medium-rare steak we requested arrived closer to medium-well, and the duck lacked the succulent juiciness one would hope for. Nevertheless, the accompanying potato side was a hit, adding a much-appreciated flair to the steak.

Dessert ended our meal on a high note, with both the raspberry crumble and lemon parfait being spot-on - a true treat for our taste buds.

The service was impeccable throughout our visit, though I can't help but wish that the excellence of service had been matched by consistency in the quality of the food.",1

14469,"This location was good, not the best I had been to but the food was still good.It's a small location but they often are, they weren't the fastest or overly friendly to say the least, and I feel like I payed too much for the amount of food given.  This is pretty standard with the kathi roll company actually.If you go, get the lamb and the goat, the chicken too.Skip the cheese.The white sauce is slightly bland and way thin, it'll cost you to get extra even though they don't put enough on to begin with.All this being said I still enjoy the flavors these things pack in, especially on the whole wheat rather than the flour rolls.",0
11927,"I recently dined at this spot with friends and was impressed by the standout short rib, which was impossibly tender – perhaps the most tender I've ever enjoyed. Although the pricing is on the higher side, including the sparkling rosé, the flavors justified the cost. The meat dish and soup dumplings were particularly delectable. A word to the wise: arrive early, as the restaurant fills up quickly, especially on weekends.",1
19264,"Olio e Piu is serves an amazing Italian meal! The food was divine and the service was excellent! The large façade is green and next to a beautiful flower shop. The inside of the restaurant is spacious and has old iron details. Its beautiful with some light streaming through small windows. K and I had dinner with large group. This way we got to share and taste multiple dishes. Excellent:1) Focaccia- this was fluffy with a great crisp on the outside. There was cheese sprinkled and it came with pesto flavored olive oil. This was amazing! 2) Polipo in Padella- Grilled tender flavorful octopus tentacles on a thin bed of olives, sundried tomatoes, radicchio. The octopus was so soft and perfectly grilled. 3) Risotto ai funghi- this was creamy unami al dente risotto. It was heavenly. I wished I ordered this myself. 4) Fusilli e manzo- fusilli with tomatoes and beef brisket, topped with parmesan. This was such a savory rich delicious dish. It had so many layers of textures and flavors. The al dente hand rolled fusilli that looked like mini twisted straws, soft savory acidity from the tomatoes and the tender rich pulled apart beef brisket. I was so full but I couldn't stop from grabbing a bite more. 5) Fettuccine with lobster- this was amazing! The half lobster was cooked al dente and the spicy tomato sauce brightened the whole dish. I loved every bite! 6) Tartare di salmone- salmon tartare. I loved the mustard seeds and the fresh salmon. It was a great app. Good: 1) Broccoli rabe with fresh garlic and chili flakes. This was tender and tasty. Also very doable at home. 2) Fettuccine granchio- Fettuccine with jumbo lump crab meat. This was very good (tasty pasta, chunks of crab meat throughout the dish) but the lobster fettuccine with the spicy tomato sauce was much better.3) Roasted baby potatoes- this was delicious and caramelized. Drinks: Belladonna- this pretty raspberry drink was delicious and refreshing! The gin was barely discernible but will definitely sneak up on you. Old Cuban- rum with prosecco and elderflower. It looked beautiful but I preferred my Belladonna drink. Desserts:Orange panna cotta- this did not look appetizing but it tasted amazing! I loved the fragrance of the orange slices and the peel. And the panna cotta was so smooth. I couldn't help but finish it.Nutella calzone- this was a beautiful and impressive dessert! I loved the gooey nutella and the crushed walnuts. This was a wonderful delicious meal! I cannot wait to return!",0

20919,"Title: High Hopes Dashed at Manhattan Ramen Spot

As an enthusiast of Tatsu's ramen in LA, I approached this sister venue in Manhattan with eager anticipation. Regrettably, the experience fell short. The service came across as hurried and cold, detracting from the dining atmosphere.

The timing of our meals was particularly disjointed, with a friend's ramen arriving a full 20 minutes ahead of ours, which themselves took over an hour to be served. The disparity left us dining at a disconnect, though the establishment's gesture of free veggie fried rice and tea to apologize for the delay was appreciated.

Space constraints added to the letdown, amplifying the absence of alcoholic beverage options. On a positive note, while my red ramen was satisfactory, it couldn't hold a candle to the LA counterpart. Nevertheless, the complimentary veggie fried rice was a highlight in taste.

In a city brimming with exceptional ramen offerings, the subpar service here was a deal-breaker for me. Despite the tasty morsels, I find myself disinclined to return.",1
18181,"Title: Authentic Dim Sum Hustle with Room for Improvement

As a fan of exploring new culinary spots, I was intrigued to revisit a family favorite for a Chinese New Year gathering as per my mother-in-law's choice. While the restaurant's enormity and vibrant chaos provide a genuine dim sum atmosphere, be prepared for an acoustic challenge that turns talking into shouting.

Seated snugly against the wall, my slimmer frame had to negotiate space every time a dim sum cart rattled by, requiring a stand-up and shout approach to place orders - mildly inconvenient yet part of the bustling experience.

Unfortunately, the meal didn't entirely live up to my lofty dim sum expectations. Several dishes disappointingly arrived lukewarm, and the usually delightful fried cruller with rice roll was notably hard and cold. Moreover, the rice roll skins could benefit from a touch more thickness, and the selection lacked diversity, with repetitive offerings circumnavigating our tables.

Photography enthusiasts, take note: capturing this culinary moment is a challenge amidst the frenzy. And a word to the wise: hone your chopstick dexterity or risk missing out on the culinary action.

The billing process, typically a spectacle of rapid mental math, faltered slightly this time around, with our waiter needing a calculator to tally our abundant order. Despite these hiccups, the overall meal was satisfactory.

Would I return? My attendance seems destined to be at the mercy of my mother-in-law's dining whims.",1
19414,"Title: Burgers Done Right at Mel's!

Last night at Mel's, my boyfriend and I found our burger haven! We walked in at 8:30 pm to a welcoming, half-full space and chose our own seats. Service was quick and friendly, with the waitress giving us some top-notch recommendations.

We feasted on a hearty spread: the ""Half and Half"" mix of fries and onion rings, tangy buffalo wings, and two mouth-watering burgers—the ""Hot Mess"" for him and ""The Dirty Hipster"" for me. Every bite met our cravings, with generous portions that matched the quality and flavor. The staff's warmth added to the experience, making the reasonable bill at the end even more satisfying.

191,"Title: A Taco Haven in Chelsea Market

If you find yourself craving tacos in Chelsea Market, look no further than this gem near the entrance. I sampled the pollo asado taco on a corn tortilla, fully loaded with all the available toppings, and it did not disappoint. The chicken was the standout—perfectly flavorful and juicy. Complementing this were the fresh and zesty pico de gallo and a variety of self-service toppings including radishes, an array of salsas, and fresh lime wedges.

The process is straightforward: order and pay at the front, then hand your receipt to the kitchen staff who will prepare your tacos to order, asking if you'd like all the fixings. Despite the lack of seating and the potential for a crowded line, the wait is worth it.

Portion-wise, one taco makes a great snack, but you might want to grab three if you've got a bigger appetite. Whether you're standing at the counter or lucky enough to snag a spot nearby to sit, these tacos are a must-try. Highly recommended for a casual but unforgettable bite in the heart of the bustling market.",1

Their crowning glory might just be the extensive sauce station; I recommend the maple Dijon, a perfect partner to their delightful sweet potato fries.

20969,"Title: A Culinary Gem for Japanese Cuisine Enthusiasts

My recent visit to this Japanese eatery was nothing short of exceptional. We were a group of four, armed with a reservation, and eager to dive into the flavors on offer. The miso hotpot was a fantastic starting point, creating a base for a feast that only got better.

The mackerel was a standout, fresh and expertly seasoned, while the tofu and fried beef tongue added a depth of unique tastes. The tuna tartar and fried chicken were delightful, each dish bringing its own character to the table. A special mention goes to the hands-on experience of crushing white sesame seeds, which we then tossed into the hotpot—it's this sort of interactive touch that elevates the dining experience.

We upped the ante by adding ramen, vegetables, and meatballs into our hotpot. The meatballs were particularly noteworthy; their flavors blossomed in the broth, marrying well with the ramen that brought comfort in every slurp.

Service matched the high quality of the food—attentive and efficient. This restaurant is a must-visit for anyone craving authentic and memorable Japanese cuisine. Highly recommended.",1
15773,"Last night, I decided to order delivery from this local Thai spot and I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised. The delivery was punctual, with each dish carefully packaged to avoid any mess, and most importantly, everything was still hot upon arrival.

I went for the Kanom Jeeb (steamed, not fried, which I appreciate being offered as an option) and the Guay Tiew Pad See Ew with shrimp. The Kanom Jeeb, priced at $8.95 for six pieces, were a delight—stuffed with a flavorful blend of mushroom, minced chicken, and visible, perfectly cooked shrimp, all complemented by a tasty, albeit salty, soy sauce. Fresh lettuce added a nice crunch to the mix.

For the main course, the Guay Tiew Pad See Ew ($15.95) was a hefty portion of wok-fried flat noodles enrobed in a savory brown sauce, with eggs and what appeared to be regular broccoli - still delicious even if it wasn't Chinese broccoli as described. The broccoli was ideally cooked, maintaining a bit of crunch in the stems. The noodles were soft and the well-prepared egg interspersed throughout added an extra layer of flavor. Shrimp, once again, were cooked to perfection.

My only gripe would be the shrimp surcharge—$2 extra compared to chicken, tofu, or veggie, for only six pieces seems a bit steep. Next time, I'd probably opt for the chicken.

In short, the meal was a hit—very good Thai food indeed, and definitely worth another order in the future.",1

19291,"This was my first time here. It was recommended by a friend who comes to Loring Place every weekend for brunch. This was lunch though. First, the space is lovely and surprising big. There were two rooms for private parties, one downstairs and one upstairs. Very pretty space. Now for the food: I had the Tuna Crudo and Lettuce Gems small plates. Both were quite delicious. I wish the Lettuce Gems didn't have mint. It was otherwise perfect. My friend had the Roasted Vegetables with Poached Egg and Pita. She loved it. My other friend had the shaved Brussels sprouts with Pecorino Romano cheese. She also enjoyed it. Everything was just seasoned perfectly. They also brought out a complimentary dish with radish and grain (farro I believe). It was tasty and certainly nice of them to provide. So why only 4 stars? I think our waiter must have also had a bad day. He was friendly and very very nice but just a bit flaky/forgetful. My friend asked for her soft drink three times. Another waitress brought out of cappaccinos but forgot to bring out sugar or sweeteners. We had to ask our waiter twice for sugar. Luckily I had Splenda on my person. By the time she got her sugar, her cappuccino was not hot. So that was a little disappointing. My girlfriend said it was a little unusual since she goes every weekend. So I'll just chalk it up to an off day. It was an otherwise perfect dining experience.",0

15340,"I absolutely adore Thai Villa, nestled in the Union Square/Flatiron area – a must-visit for Thai cuisine aficionados. A word to the wise, lunchtime is golden if you want to avoid the queue. Come evening, be prepared to wait, but thank goodness for the Yelp waitlist!

Service? Top-notch – the staff are as friendly as they are efficient. And the lunch special – only $14 – is a steal. It sets you up with a tasty appetizer (I savored the spring rolls), a refreshing salad with a zesty peanut dressing, and a mouth-watering main course.

Speaking of which, the red curry with chicken was a revelation. It had just the right kick of spice and an ample serving of fresh vegetables to boot. With the chill of NYC setting in, I'm eagerly looking forward to returning for more of their curries and noodle dishes.

For those who want to beat the lunchtime crowd, arrive before the noon rush – the special starts at 11:30 AM. Thai Villa truly offers a remarkable dining experience with an ambiance to match, all without breaking the bank.",1
14324,"Title: Yi Ji Shi Mo - A Worthy Successor to Sun Hing Lung Co

Finding out that Sun Hing Lung Co had closed down was a tough pill to swallow; their cheung fun was the epitome of delicious, affordable comfort food. However, my recent visit to Yi Ji Shi Mo in NYC proved to be a delightful surprise and a fitting alternative for my cheung fun cravings.

Yi Ji Shi Mo is a quintessential hole-in-the-wall, with space so limited it might best be described as cozy, forcing most customers to opt for take-away or share their meal at a communal table. Unlike Sun Hing Lung Co, the prices are slightly higher, with a small tray of cheung fun starting between $3 and $5, plus an additional dollar or so for each topping. Despite the price difference, Yi Ji Shi Mo compensates with generous servings.

The cheung fun itself is delicious, matching the high standards I've come to expect from traditional eateries in Chinatown. For anyone seeking a no-frills spot to enjoy good-tasting cheung fun, Yi Ji Shi Mo is undoubtedly worth the recommendation. Next time you're in the area, give Yi Ji Shi Mo a try – it's a testament to the simple yet satisfying culinary experiences that Chinatown has to offer.",1

14941,"Title: A Tale of Two Visits: Comfort and Quirks at Fournos

I recently enjoyed my second MealPal experience at Fournos, a charming spot that exudes a cute and cozy vibe. Admittedly, I haven't dined-in long enough to comment on their regular service, but their takeout bowls have left an impression.

My first encounter involved a lemon chicken and spinach bowl, served in an attractively patterned vessel that certainly caught my eye. Unfortunately, the chicken was disappointingly dry and the rice came with an unexpected crunch – possibly from seeds or uncooked grains – detracting from the overall flavor. The spinach, dressed in a honey-like sauce, provided a sweet and zesty lift, though I craved a more even distribution of dressing.

Despite my lukewarm initial experience, the allure of today's meatball and spinach salad offering tempted me back. The meatballs, humorously sausage-shaped, were well-seasoned with oregano and complemented by the familiar sweet spinach. The orzo was a mixed bag; the top layer was arid until aided by tomato sauce, while the bottom succumbed to oiliness. I pondered the type of oil used, wishing for a more uniform mix.

In summary, while Fournos offers a straightforward and homely array of dishes in their MealPal selection, consistency seems to be a hit-or-miss. And while the in-person menu remains a mystery to my online searches, my curiosity might just lead to a third visit.",1
19736,"I absolutely love the spicy noodles here ($10-11). Depending on how hungry you are, you could get them by itself or with the spicy pork or beef ($14-$15). You get a buzzer and when it rings, you get the food. It's all pretty quick. I mean it's a cafeteria style place so obviously the ambiance is casual. With so many options at this food hall, it can be hard to decide but I do think the spicy flavor of the noodle paired with the thick udon texture really make them stand out.",0
17760,"I recently visited a local gem that boasts a massive menu with a host of creative vegetarian options and hearty sandwiches. The delivery is reliable, and the quality is consistently pleasing.

The DIY sandwich option seems overpriced, so I recommend sticking with the pre-set choices, which are more wallet-friendly, ranging from $11-13. A standout is the grilled chicken, which is remarkably moist and flavorful. My personal favorite is the Viva La Gusto, a perfect blend of grilled chicken, bacon, cheddar, lettuce, and tomato, generously filled to the brim.

Another must-try is the Frank Sinatra sandwich, loaded with an indulgent assortment of meats like soppressata, mortadella, and salami, along with pecorino and provolone cheeses - a true carnivore's delight, eschewing the dreaded bread-heavy experience.

While most options are stellar, I'd suggest skipping the Reuben; it was just average and didn't meet my cravings. However, for those seeking something on the lighter side, the salads come highly recommended by colleagues.

Overall, with its delightful sandwiches and reasonable prices, this spot is definitely on my list for a return visit. Phenomenal flavors and satisfying portions make it a top pick for sandwich enthusiasts.",1

The seating itself was a bit tight, but we managed to seat somehow! The hostess was friendly and welcoming.For drinks, I ordered the Right Bank ($16) which wasn't that great and lacked that punch in the drink that I was looking for. Presentation was pretty good though.I did all the ordering for our table and we got a few amazing appetizers which included Lasuni Gobi ($12), Habanero Tikka ($13), Kasundi Prawns ($16), Bhatti Murgh Ki Champ ($16), and Paratwala Paneer ($12). All appetizers were absolutely delicious and the Bhatti Murgh was a clear winner. The way they serve it and the flavors of this dish were absolutely mind blowing. It wasn't that spicy at all either, so spice level was manageable on this dish. Lasuni Gobi and Kasundi Prawns were our 2nd favorites.For mains we ordered 4 entrees between the 6 of us, which was sufficient food and included Dal Makhani ($18), Butternut Squash ke Kofte ($20), Fenugreek Murgh ($21), and Chicken Tikka Masala ($22). We also ordered Garlic Naan and Butter Naan ($4 each) and a Paneer aur Hari Mirchi Kulcha ($7). Fenugreek was my personal favorite with a nice spice kick to the dish but Chicken Tikke Masala with heavy cream on the side was a table favorite and disappeared within a few seconds after hitting our table!We finished off with 2 desserts, aRoqa Daulat Ki Chaat ($10) and Coconut Kheer ($10). The Kheer was a little too sweet to our liking, but the Daulat ki Chaat was absolutely delicious. Presentation was spot on!By about 7:45 pm, this place was packaged and noise levels were high, so having a conversation was a little difficult.Service was absolutely amazing and our server was very attentive.",0

I recently had the pleasure of dining at this local gem, and let me tell you, it was an exceptional experience. We started with the dumplings and steamed pork buns – both were incredibly fresh and delectable, with the pork buns standing out as my personal favorite. Moving on to the main course, we savored both the beef noodles in soup and the regular spicy beef noodles. The broth of the soup was rich and flavorful, a testament to their attention to detail. The spicy beef noodles struck the perfect balance of heat, complemented by flawlessly cooked noodles. This establishment is a must-visit for anyone in search of top-notch dishes that delight the palate. Highly recommended indeed!",1
18328,I really wished I could fall in love with this place as we go to the AMC theatre nearby quite often and this place could have been one of our go-to places in the hood. Unfortunately We were a bit disappointed.Went for a quick bite on a Sunday afternoon before movie. We opted for the cross bridge soup which was very greasy and didn't have much taste. It wasn't bubbly hot when it was served (although it was still hot). My boyfriend got the tomato soup with sirloin. The sirloin was tough and not tender as what I had read from other reviews.Service was quick and attentive. Seatings were a bit tight but we managed. Maybe I've had such a great experience at a new cross bridge rice noodle place in Chinatown that I was comparing this place to.,0
19562,"Having ventured to this establishment for their kaiseki and omakase offerings, my experience, unfortunately, left much to be desired. 

Upon arrival, the ambiance immediately struck me as incongruent with a traditional sushi experience; the pulsing hip hop music clashed with the setting and made the already challenging task of navigating to the sushi bar an unnecessarily cumbersome ordeal.

The service did little to elevate the experience, with a strong push for add-ons at the outset and lackluster attention during the omakase, where the pacing dramatically suffered. Waiting upwards of seven minutes between sushi pieces disrupted the rhythm of the meal, especially as the chef's focus seemed skewed toward a favorite regular.

The kaiseki began with fresh, albeit modest fish courses and a notable beef short rib that melted in the mouth—arguably the highlight. However, at $40, the value proposition of these dishes was questionable.

The omakase journey began unconventionally with a toro that was disappointingly too soft, failing to meet expectations of texture and richness. Several white fish selections followed, suffering from a lack of wasabi and soy sauce, rendering them bland until the redemption arc commenced with an impeccable scallop and continued with superb sweet shrimp and a grilled toro that was the epitome of umami. The meal concluded with a cod tempura adorned with truffle and an unexpectedly delightful apple pie.

Despite these few standout dishes, the overall experience failed to justify the hefty price tag. Coming from a city known for its culinary excellence, this New York experience fell short. Hence, with a heavy heart and an unsatisfied palate, I cannot endorse this establishment to those seeking a meal worth its extravagant cost.",1
17565,"Dons Bogam is a Korean BBQ spot in the heart of K-Town that differentiates itself with a sleek look and a focus on wine.I came here with a group of coworkers who snagged a same-day reservation on a weekday for our large group. Service was super accommodating with some of our party arriving late; combined with the family-style serving, this is a good spot for big groups assuming everyone's down to spend.Of our starters, our japchae (veggie noodles) was head and shoulders above the rest; simple yet addictive. I thought their pajeon (seafood pancake) was both too greasy and too plain. I didn't really understand the hype with their fluffy egg dish, which was tasty but topped with overcooked bacon.All of the banchan was excellent; we particularly loved the green onion salad. The rice is also nice and they serve rounds of lettuce wraps. The sauces were kind of meh other than the delicious garlic butter that they heat on the grill.On meats, I thought the quality was good overall. The pork belly was very nice. I'm not sure which beef we had, but it bothered me how much they cooked it; I had to steal it off the grill before it was deemed officially done by the grill master to maintain any tenderness. And I'm not talking rare, I'm talking well past medium with solid char on the outside. It was hard for me to tell how high quality the beef actually was when it's been cooked to death.The price per head ($80 post tax and tip) struck me as high, but we did get a lot of food and alcohol out of that. Well, I guess we leaned heavier on the latter-- a round of makkoli, two flavored sojus (the pineapple beat the grapefruit handily), and a bottle or two of wine among the nine of us.Service is far better than average for the neighborhood. The atmosphere is lively without being turnt. Their vents actually work pretty well to suck up the meat smell.I have yet to find a favorite K-BBQ spot, and Dons Bogams hasn't claimed that spot-- I think it's a little pricey for what it is and I'm not a fan of how long they cook their beef. But if you want a solid mid-to-upscale experience, Dons Bogams will do the trick.",0
1493,"Spot is a petite dessert shop offering over-the-top, Asian-inspired desserts located conveniently on St. Marks.I'd tried their K-Town outpost and found the experience to be stressful and the Harvest to be underwhelming, but when one of my, er, hungry friends suggested it, I decided they deserved another shot.We came around 10:45 on a Saturday night; they don't quote waits but it ended up being about 15 minutes for a table for our party of 5.Desserts are $12 across the board and very shareable; 3 dishes worked well for 5 people.Miso butterscotch was moist and bread-pudding-esque, and though it had a whiff of je ne se quoi it mostly tasted like straightforward butterscotch. The condensed milk ice cream was a surprise highlight and one of my favorite things we had.Matcha lava, one of their signatures, balanced bitter and sweet well, and had the perfect consistency with both an airy exterior and a melty interior. Coconut monkey bread was heavenly-- a fluffy skillet of sticky coffee cake covered with melting coconut ice cream and Thai tea drizzle.What really stuck out to me was the consistent execution. This may be stoner food, served into the wee hours, but they take it seriously. The textures on everything were textbook, the flavors well balanced, and there was always a scoop of ice cream or drizzle of sauce to moisten up a rich piece of cake. And of course everything is photogenic.Service was super fast. The location is small and not exactly luxurious but things are kept clean. It's not wheelchair accessible, with multiple flights of stairs. Nut allergies were easily accommodated, and they usually have one vegan option.Not an everyday treat, but fun for group seeking gluttony.",0

The option to amp up the frozen daiquiri with an extra shot for just $2 was a win, though the Texas style's generous pour is worth considering for those seeking a bigger indulgence. Note that the drinks come non-alcoholic, so you'll need to mix in the shot yourself—a fun, interactive touch. The daiquiri was on the sweeter side, but overall, it was a nice place to kick back and savor a drink with some classic fried sides. We left satisfied with our experience.",1
19938,"Title: A Delightful Discovery in the East Village

I recently ventured into a new Chinese spot in the East Village and was thoroughly impressed with the experience. For those seeking a reliable takeout option or a budget-friendly lunch, this establishment ticks all the boxes. While compact, the indoor seating area is charming and laid-back, perfect for a casual meal.

The menu selection was a pleasant surprise, especially with its variety of vegetarian dishes. I indulged in the shrimp and eggplant in garlic sauce, which was served with rice—a savory delight. My friend opted for the vegetarian bean curd vegetable with rice, and both dishes didn’t disappoint.

We rounded off our meal with crispy spring rolls and flavorful scallion pancakes that complemented our mains beautifully.

In conclusion, this Chinese restaurant is a great addition to the East Village dining scene. Whether you’re a meat-lover or a vegetarian, you’ll find something to enjoy here.

2511,Very cute atmosphere. The pho was solid! However the DIY option is pricey for nothing that much better than getting the regular pho bowls. And the 25 hr broth wasn't that much better than the 8 hours (for the extra $5). Overall tasty but pricier than I'd like for my usual pho.,0
3060,"Tucked away in a charming pocket of the Upper East Side, flush with shopping options, this quaint spot delivered exactly what I was searching for – a traditional breakfast done right. The menu boasted an impressive array of morning staples: a variety of egg plates, fluffy pancakes, and golden French toast, all teasing the taste buds of early risers.

I indulged in the cheese omelette, which arrived perfectly hot and lived up to its promise: the potatoes were melt-in-your-mouth soft, and the egg oozed with a generous serving of cheese. The cranberry juice was an unexpected delight, striking the perfect chord of tart and sweet.

Service here deserves a round of applause – attentive and friendly staff catered to the dining experience without rushing it, making sure everything from order to table was seamless and swift. 

However, the exclusivity of the locale comes with a price tag to match. Expect your wallet to feel the weight of a traditional breakfast, with plates and a beverage inching over the $20 mark and a starting tip suggestion of 25%. While costlier than your average diner, for foodies in search of quality breakfast fare in a welcoming atmosphere, this spot might just be worth the splurge.",1
18804,"Title: A Seafood Delight You Can't Miss at Capt. Loui!

I've scoured Philly to no avail for the perfect seafood boil-in-a-bag experience; imagine my joy upon discovering Capt. Loui in Harlem! It's an underwater haven for seafood lovers like me, where the indulgence begins with an enticing selection of mussels, clams, lobster, and king crab legs.

Decisions at Capt. Loui might be tough, but they're mouthwatering – choose between a hefty single serve or a combo that generously throws in noodles or a whole lobster. I paired my clams with shrimp, sausage, and the mild kick of Louisiana sauce, accompanied by the staple corn and potatoes, and was treated to some scrumptious garlic noodles on the side.

This place ticked every box for me: the quirky joy of dining straight from a bag, flavors that dance on the palate, and warm service that wraps around you like a cozy blanket. Capt. Loui is not just a meal; it's a seafood adventure I wholeheartedly recommend to anyone seeking culinary treasures in Harlem.",1
2992,"Title: A Missed Opportunity for a Culinary Delight

My recent visit to the mentioned restaurant was, unfortunately, a letdown. Service fell short of expectations, as we had to request water refills multiple times due to inattentive staff. The drink experience was subpar; my boyfriend's cocktail was shockingly underpoured, and my Old Fashioned was cloyingly sweet, reminiscent of Big Red gum.

The food was a mixed bag. The tuna tartare appetizer shone brightly as the runner-up star of the meal, but the roots and squash dish failed to excite the palate. The lamb sliders were the highlight, delicious but left us desiring just a bit more. The salmon was satisfactory, but the bistec was marred by an unpleasant chewiness, though the accompanying fries were a saving grace. The brussels sprouts were decent, yet unremarkable. Our final course, the Black Derby dessert, had a promising flavor but was let down by icy ice cream.

In summary, while there were a few culinary high points, the overall experience left us longing for the wow factor that simply wasn't delivered. It was a bummer of an experience that could have been much more.",1

As someone conscious of dietary restrictions, I was delighted to find that their arepas are gluten-free, making the experience all the more enjoyable. El Cocotero has set the bar high, leaving me wishing for more arepa-focused eateries like this gem.",1
20007,The customer service at this place is definitely 5 stars but the food was just so so for Italian food in NYC. I enjoyed the mussels appetizer but the bread that came with it was cold. I also didn't care for the beans/lentils that came with the bread? I would have preferred a nice oil. The shrimp were a bit dry thought I did like the pasta sauce. My friend's lava cake was nice but the tiramisu was just a bit off? Like a bit too wet and not flavorful enough. That being said I think the appetizers are really good and I also enjoyed my red wine.,0
19349,"Title: Charming Spot with Quality Eats Next Door

My recent lunch break at this adorable eatery, tucked right beside my office, was a delightful discovery! Upon entering at the bustling noon hour, my friend and I were seated in just a minute—impressive given the crowd. The service was efficient yet unhurried, a rare balance in the city.

Admittedly, the menu prices are what you'd expect in NYC, with salads and sandwiches ranging from $13-20. However, the lunch special—a BBQ cauliflower salad—caught my attention. Despite my usual indifference to BBQ, this dish surprised me. The salad was generously portioned, delectably balanced in sweetness and salt, and satisfyingly hearty. My companion's fried chicken sandwich also impressed, boasting a homemade charm far removed from fast-food fare.

We topped off our meal with a $11 mulled wine, a cozy embrace of autumn in a cup, and despite the steeper prices, the experience and flavors justify a return visit. The Halloween decor added a playful touch, enhancing the spot's inviting vibe. A gem worth revisiting!",1
17116,"Unfortunately, my latest visit to this salad joint only reaffirmed my previous disappointments. Consistently, I encounter issues with my order, and this time was no exception. I expected crunchy wontons but instead found walnuts sprinkled atop my greens — a mix-up I found rather unappetizing. Moreover, my request for light dressing was ignored, resulting in a pool of excess dressing at the bottom of my bowl. For those who cherish a good salad, I suggest making the extra trek to Chopt, where your salad wishes are more likely to be accurately fulfilled.",1
1129,"Overall, a decent experience. Nice atmosphere, quick service, and decent food. However, the food is VERY oily, and definitely leaves you feeling pretty lethargic. My friend and I came for brunch on a Saturday around 1:45PM. We made a reservation, which seemed smart, since there were still a lot of people waiting even late into the afternoon. We ordered the pork belly buns and the fried potatoes and onions to start. I ordered the spicy pork sausage and rice cakes with egg (additional charge) and my friend ordered the ham and bacon cornbread and burrata. The pork belly buns were SOAKED in oil, the bun was almost disgusting. It's a nice taste (a bit salty) and the pork belly is a good consistency, but overall it was way too oily to be good. The fried potatoes and onions were quite simple but delicious. They come with a sweet, spicy sauce (almost like Sriracha) that really brings the onions and potatoes together. Strangely easy but delicious dish. The rice cakes that I ordered were very monotonous. The whole dish was just rice cakes in the sauce - I wish the dish came with rice or something. It's also a lot of rice cakes (which I guess is a good thing). The taste is pretty unique, almost like a curry taste, so it is quite good. However, it was also pretty oily and again it gets pretty boring pretty fast since you're literally just eating rice cakes in sauce. My friends cornbread dish looked very interesting. I tried a bit of the corn bread and it was quite good! The cornbread lies in a pan under what looks like prosciutto and burrata.Overall the dishes were good, but they were a bit much in terms of oil - so proceed at your own caution.",0

Our party of six was well taken care of late on a weekday night. Star. Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?Rossini's isn't as expensive as I thought it was going to be, but that's not to say it's a bargain. My specialty pork pasta of the evening ran me $28.00 for a medium portion, which was just about right given the atmosphere of Rossini's. Star. Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?To my surprise, this pasta dish simply wasn't that good. Just by looking at the picture I took you can probably tell that it was plain, but even after I added some black pepper to the mix I couldn't get over the fact that this was simply some very basic pasta and pieces of pork. It was a sum of its parts, which was disappointing. No Stars. Star 5: Would you be excited to go back?There's so much good pasta in town that it's hard to say I would. No Star.",0

Having returned to this establishment after a few years, I can't help but notice its downturn. The once delectable grilled skewers that drew me in have lost their charm. On a positive note, prices remain fair and the portions generous. The agedashi tofu did provide some solace, hitting the spot nicely. Unfortunately, the skewers were a letdown, with undercooked pieces raising concerns, especially the chicken which is a clear no-go when not done thoroughly. Overdone chicken gizzards and hearts were equally disappointing, lacking in flavor. Even my go-to chicken skin failed to impress this time around. While it may still serve as a decent late-night option, yakitori aficionados might want to temper their expectations.",1

We decided to give it a try since they were known for some specialty pizzas. We walked in and found a table for the 3 of us to sit and eat. We went up to the glass and saw a variety of pizzas to choose from. It was definitely a modern pizza place and did not give off an authentic feel. We ordered some of the popular pizzas such as the Chicken Alfredo, Buffalo Cheese, Truffle Mushroom and Caprese. The price was higher than other pizza places making each pizza slice about $4. The pizzas were pretty tasty but for the price, it was not worth it in my opinion. The location is great and the seating is very comfortable.

Fortunately, this initial impression was quickly offset by the exceptional service provided by the waitstaff. Their friendliness and attentiveness made our dining experience much more enjoyable, including pleasant conversation during drink refills.

As for the cuisine, the calamari and fish and chips we opted to share did not disappoint. The calamari was delicious, especially when paired with the accompanying sauce. The fish was perfectly seasoned, avoiding the pitfall of being overly salty, and the thick-cut fries served alongside were a hit for those who favor a softer, less crispy potato.

17971,"I recently had the pleasure of dining at an awesome spot in NY that offers a unique twist on the classic burger experience. The vibe is fun, and while some draw parallels to Five Guys, their burger hits a notch above in my opinion.

Fair warning, though: don't come here just for the burger if a two-hour wait isn't your thing. But if you're up for an hour-long queue, you'll be rewarded not only with a mouth-watering burger but also with an immersive experience. The restaurant is cleverly tucked away in a posh hotel, boasting walls adorned with memorabilia and graffiti that ignite conversation.

The staff's warmth and the camaraderie you find amongst fellow out-of-towners enhance the whole ordeal. Pair your burger with a beer and soak in the ambiance.

Thankfully, Yelp's waitlist worked its magic, and we were cozily seated earlier than anticipated—a pleasant surprise indeed!

We whetted our appetites with the Pla Muk Tod, a crispy fried calamari complemented by a punchy spicy mayo that left us hankering for more. For the mains, my partner's Similan Curry was a delectable gathering of flavors, with tender chicken and soft potatoes nestled in rich Thai curry paste, the roti and cucumber relish adding layers of texture and freshness. As for me, the Up Thai Fried Rice Clay Pot wasn't just a dish but an experience. The mingling of sea scallop, shrimp, chicken, and Chinese sausage with shiitake mushrooms and scallions, hugged by the unique essence of the clay pot, was nothing short of culinary artistry.

After hearing waves of praise for Rubirosa, the struggle to secure a reservation only heightened our anticipation. Finally stepping through the doors, we were warmly greeted and advised to dive into the pizzeria's offerings with a half Tie-Dye, half Bianca pie. 

The Tie-Dye pizza was the standout—its crust mastered the art of being thin yet simultaneously soft and chewy. Topped with a sauce that burst with freshness, it created an impeccable balance, ensuring every bite was succulent without being soggy. In contrast, while the Bianca and Old School Clam Pie were satisfactory, they paled against the Tie-Dye's triumph.

Our venture into the pasta menu with the Bucatini did not disappoint. The pasta's perfect al dente texture coupled with the vibrant tomato sauce rounded off a genuinely delightful dining experience. Rubirosa lived up to the hype, delivering a meal that was both comforting and refined.",1
10219,"Title: Fresh and Zesty Lunch Experience with Minor Flaws

I stopped by for lunch and decided to try the Tuna Classic with an inventive twist by opting for yuzu sauce instead of the traditional shoyu. The flavor was refreshing, but the overpowering quantity of onions in the dish detracted from my enjoyment. However, a highlight was the complimentary housemade iced tea - a passionfruit green tea that was delightfully unsweetened, ticking all the right boxes for my palate.

Service was swift, and the ambiance of the restaurant enhanced the experience. The interior boasts an impressive tall plant stretching up to the skylight, creating a unique and inviting atmosphere. Despite the onion-heavy poke, the overall quality of the food and the lively vibe will bring me back for another visit.",1
15212,Came across this place since our friends wanted dessert. Service was friendly and food is decent. I'd recommend their crepes. They have a pretty limited selection of frozen yogurt flavors. I usually get fruit for my toppings but it looked like no one's really touched it in a very long time since the slices of peaches were all brown... it was very unappetizing.,0
11428,"Title: A Late-Night Gem Perfect for Groups and Sushi Lovers

Review: This restaurant is an excellent choice for group outings or late-night cravings, as its spacious interior typically means you're seated immediately. My partner and I frequent this spot, which is conveniently close to his place, and we're consistently impressed with the attentive and friendly service.

We often indulge in the sushi deluxe sets, which are not only a feast for the palate with their fresh taste but also a treat for the eyes with their beautiful presentation. What's more, the establishment offers an unbeatable happy hour with buy one get one free on drinks all day, making it an ideal spot for enjoying a tipple or two. Whether you're looking for a reliable dining experience or simply to revel in some delightful sushi, this restaurant won't disappoint. Highly recommended for both the food and the service.",1
15424,"Came here for a quick drink while waiting on a friend, before heading out for the night. At the bar, I ordered a glass of Pinot Grigio wine.  Ambience was chill and the bartender was nice. However, unfortunately the bartender gave me the wrong wine (Sav Blanc). When I pointed it out, she tried to insist that I ordered the Sav Blanc, and stated that they were out of the Pinot Grigio either way. To me  A.) I'm definitely aware that I ordered a Pinot Grigio (as I am not a fan of Sav Blanc), and  B.) if you were supposedly out of the drink I ordered, wouldn't you tell the patron before deciding to pour an entirely different drink for them? It could've been her honest mistake, but to play it off as if the patron was wrong was a bit off putting for me. The difference in price in minimal, but it's the principle of the matter. This left a bad first impression. Side note: you get a free ""prickly pear shot"" if you check in with Yelp.",0
21114,"I visited a pho restaurant in the East Village recently and had an entirely average experience. I opted for the beef brisket pho and found the dish pleasant enough with a subtly sweet broth, though nothing particularly stood out. The noodles and beef met expectations, but I was taken aback by the additional 50-cent charge for three extra lime wedges. While prices, quality, and flavors were all standard, be prepared to pay for any extras, which can add up.",1
14533,"Title: A Slice of Heaven at Broadway Slice

If you've ever found yourself craving an authentic pizza experience amidst the sea of generic chain eateries near NYP, Broadway Slice is your salvation. This refreshing small business echoes the sentiments of pizza aficionados who find the likes of Sbarro and Famiglia lackluster. At Broadway Slice, authenticity and value go hand in hand. One can indulge in enormous slices that justify the reasonable price of $3 for plain cheese or $3.50 with a topping. Though the cozy space is modest, a smart layout ensures quick service by giving delivery personnel a separate entrance. The ambiance is enhanced by a well-curated playlist that serenades patrons as they dine in. It's worth noting that the portion sizes are hearty — most will find two slices more than sufficient. I'm thrilled to support this welcome newcomer and wish them great success. Also, a friendly nod to pizza enthusiasts everywhere: take the critiques from Chicago with a grain of salt — Broadway Slice knows how to do pizza right.",1
19695,"I recently dined at this establishment and found the value for money to be quite impressive. We opted for the Omakase menu, which did not disappoint, and I'm keen on returning to try their Handrolls. A special mention goes to the Ankimo Handroll; added to our order on a whim, it turned out to be a favorite of mine. Highly recommend for both quality and price.",1
16004,"Upon sampling the cheeseburger sushi roll at this innovative eatery near Flatiron, I experienced a culinary epiphany. The roll, which ingeniously combines the essence of a medium-rare cheeseburger with the finesse of sushi, is nothing short of a gastronomic marvel. As if the tantalizing flavors weren't enough to secure my adoration, the restaurant's efficient self-checkout system, the absence of lines, a welcoming and prompt staff, and a treasure trove of Asian snacks round out an impeccable dining experience. Hats off to the Australians behind this genius concept for redefining my lunchtime favorites.",1
3239,"I'm a little disappointed that we didn't have dinner here since it was all the rave but we got reservations for brunch. I'm told you can't get a seat here unless you're either alone or there's a last minute cancellation.The brunch menu is completely different and smaller than dinner but there were some good options. We ordered five different main dishes (see photos) along with some appetizers including steamed buns, fried potatoes and onions and beets and endives. Each were really good in it's own way. The steamed buns were the best for appetizers. Of the main dishes, I had the smoked fish Benedict which was the least favorite (too dry). The best main dish was the duck and avocado toast.I'm happy with the meal overall but brunch dining with a dinner price may be extreme. I'll pass on brunch but will return to try their dinner.",0
3527,"I heard a lot about this place for a long time and today I finally had the chance to be there. Two things about this place:1. They used to be called VISH, and this is how they still show up in social media. However the name that you see when you get there is SUNSHINE HUMMUS ( and it's not a recent change, it's like that for few months already...)2. They only make limited amount of hummus every day, and when it's done, it's done  . I was there couple months back, arriving at 6:30 pm and they already ran out of hummus. So if you want to go there, plan your times right.The hummus was really tasty, one of the best in NYC, but not yet the best one. I ordered the Mashausha (mixed with tahini and chickpeas) and it was in the right temperature and texture. Loved it.I really liked the pickles, green olives and white onion that are served for free and you can get as much as you desire.Another good thing is the vegan shawarma that you can add to your hummus. And it was GOOD! If you are in the area, and in the right time (mid-day works best) - pay them a visit!",0
16501,"Title: A Brunch to Remember at a Charming Spot Off 181st

I recently enjoyed a truly amazing brunch experience at this gem of a restaurant conveniently located just off 181st on the A line. The venue basks in natural light, creating a cheerful ambiance complemented by walls adorned with captivating old school photographs, adding abundant character to the dining environment.

The French toast, a standout dish, was scrumptious, perfectly paired with fresh fruit and eggs, satisfying my brunch cravings to the fullest. And for those who fancy a tipple with their meal, they offer the first Bloody Mary at the irresistible price of just $2 – a delightful start to anyone's day.

What elevated the meal further was the laid-back atmosphere fostered by the staff who let us dine at our leisure, making it an ideal spot for a relaxed catch-up with friends or a cozy meal with a loved one.

I can't recommend this place enough, even for those not from the neighborhood. It's well worth the trip for a taste of their delectable brunch offerings and to enjoy the overall warmth and charm of the establishment.",1
18416,"I am a fan of Boucherie, visited both Boucherie locations, and had great experience and amazing food from both places. When they added another location named Petite Boucherie, we were more than excited to go try this location. As the name of the restaurant implied, the inside was quite small. Very cozy and welcoming atmosphere. For appetizer, we had Camembert Roti and Soupe À L'oignon Au Fromage. Now, ask yourself, do you love cheese? Do you dream about bathing in a melty, velvety, rich pool of hot cheese? Then Camembert Roti might be your soulmate. Cheese lovers' dream! So amazing, high quality, and just melt your heart... French onion soup was a thing of beautify, with the golden cheese on top, holding in all the liquid goodness down below.For main, we had Wagyu Truffle Burger and Steak Frites Beurre Maître d'hôtel. The burger was much bigger than I expected, and it looked so wonderful...These amazing burgers are the reason why I could never stop my love and obsession for burgers... I totally LOVED it!!! The steak was really nice too, almost crunchy and crispy on the outside, cooked a bit more than med rare that we requested, which was a bit sad... But, it was still tasty.For dessert, we had Crème Brûlée. It was very creamy and velvety, classic done right! We had a wonderful dinner, Boucherie never disappoint! Our server, Sophie was super friendly and helpful, took a great care of us. She was so lovely! The manager Michael was really nice too, we enjoyed talking to him. We felt totally welcomed. It was a really relaxing dinner with delicious food, love to return again for more!",0
19251,"I'm not really the type to seek out British food but my friend wanted to try out a British pub so off I went. First of all, place was very popular on a Thursday night, especially at the bar. I ordered the beef and ale pie which was pretty tasty. I do think they could have added more steak though (especially for the price) and the mashed potatoes that accompanied it tasted very bland (I've had better at my school cafeteria). I also ordered one of the ales (the London-something) that I liked. Star of the meal really had to be the desserts though. We ordered the flourless chocolate cake, the carrot cake, and the sticky toffee pudding. I thought they were all very well made and enjoyed them all equally; the sticky toffee pudding was especially well received by our table though, so if you're stuck deciding I'd recommend going with that one.",0
2961,"Title: Mixed Feelings About the Noodle Spot

My recent visit to this local restaurant left me with a mixed bag of impressions. Upon entry, the apparent cleanliness was overshadowed by a nearly hazardous, greasy floor - a curious oversight in an otherwise tidy environment.

The menu offered some hits and misses. The shrimp rice noodles, although tasty, suffered from stingy portioning compared to nearby competitors. In contrast, the chow fun noodles stood out as a flavorful highlight. However, the ""crab emperor rice balls"" were a letdown, lacking any crab flavor or content - a fact nonchalantly explained by the waiter as merely ""just the name."" Similarly deceptive was the wasabi calamari, which turned out to be heavily dough-wrapped squid with a dollop of wasabi mayo.

Thirst prompted by the salty fare hit another snag when a glass of water arrived with uninvited floaters, pushing me to stick to the food. Payment convenience was present in the form of card acceptance, though the inflexibility of splitting payments was a minus.

Service could be described as lackluster, and several dishes were forgettable. Despite these drawbacks, the standout noodles and rice rolls do beckon a return visit. All in all, visit for the noodles, but manage expectations elsewhere.",1
11149,"Last minute invite for St. Patty's day! I had the pleasure of swinging by Pete's on this momentous occasion. Naturally, the place was super packed, but luckily my friends thought ahead and grabbed a table. They had some St. Patty's day specials. Honestly, I didn't order a dish, but I had bites of people's food and kind of did halfsies on Fish and Chips. The Fish and Chips came with two battered fish. It was mostly doughy, didn't have the familiar crispyness, but it was tasty! Their shepherds pie is also a good buy too. Steak fries vs shoestring: I'm more of a steak fries fan, so definitely recommend that!Drink: Cinnamon toast! It's a warm drink and it was kind of a cold day.",0
12669,"Title: Disappointing Experience at Poketeria

Having ventured out of my way based on its impressive Yelp ratings, I anticipated an exceptional poke experience at Poketeria, but instead, I encountered a letdown. As an LA local, my poke standards are high, and unfortunately, Poketeria fell short of them. The prices were slightly elevated, which I could have overlooked if the portions hadn’t been disappointingly meager, with the scoops of fish leaving much to be desired in terms of generosity—more air than substance. 

A poke bowl's foundation is just as important as its toppings, and the use of plain romaine instead of a vibrant mix of greens was another point of disillusionment. While they were liberal with the avocado—at an extra $2 charge, they certainly should be—I find such a surcharge excessive. Despite opting for a 2-scoop salad, which typically would be more than enough, I left Poketeria without the feeling of satiation I'm accustomed to. 

In all, while the meal wasn't a disaster, it's clear to me that Poketeria’s reputation might be a tad inflated. LA’s poke spots remain unchallenged by this New York encounter.",1
20575,"I've waited a while to try Gnocchi and if it always taste as good as this first time, I'm hooked. I recently learned that there are two types, pasta style & potato style and here they can provide both. I wanted the exact image I saw on a review so I opted for potato, wow. It is delicious, like it dissolves in your mouth and with the pesto sauce it's a plus. This dish is pretty filling, being that it's potato and a good amount is served. So willing to try the pasta style with other sauces. Also had a few merlot glasses of wine, perfect pairing. The restaurant is a bit tight but intimate, candlelights & hanging lights being the only light they provide, very Europe. The staff are friendly & attentive. This will be a place to return.",0
19971,"Decided to stop by here for brunch and had  to try out the biscuits and gravy skillet (Herb & gruyere biscuits, house sausage & cracked pepper white gravy, 2 poached eggs) and will have to say it was fantastic.   Definitely some great comfort type of food for the rainy day.   Would definitely recommend this dish if you're in need of good food.",0

20475,"Came here on a Friday night as a group of 10. Staff was very accommodating and they have a private-ish area upstairs where we were sat. The vibe was very old school Italian, as is evident with the menu options as well!Overall everyone was pleased with their dish. One critique I have is that I wish there were more vegetarian options on the menu. Currently, there was only an Alfredo pasta and a cheese ravioli to choose from. About half of my group was vegetarian so we all basically got the same thing. All the food was delicious, especially their red sauce.",0
13271,"Title: A Modest Greek Fix in FiDi

As an Astoria native with a soft spot for Greek cuisine, I ventured twice into one of the few Greek spots in the Financial District, drawn by the familiar craving. While overshadowed by renowned establishments like Uncle Gussy's and GRK, this eatery offers a serviceable Greek fix.

The restaurant occupies a less-than-inviting location, which might explain why it hasn't reached peak popularity. Expectations for an authentic Astoria Greek experience should be tempered here; the offerings are decidedly average and Manhattan-priced.

The lamb and beef gyro had promise with their juicy, tender cuts, yet they fell short on flavor, scant on tzatziki, and lacking in robust seasoning. Portions won't satisfy a hearty appetite unless supplemented with additional sides.

The restaurant appears to sustain itself through online and phone orders, with a quiet lunchtime in-house service, likely due to its hidden setting. If you find yourself in FiDi with an urgent Greek craving, this spot might suffice for a quick grab-and-go, but for a more memorable meal, I'd recommend looking elsewhere.",1
15921,"My dining experience could only be described as magical, possibly the best I've ever had. Faced with the delightful conundrum of choosing between a tasting menu and a 4-course meal, we opted for the latter, allowing us to sample a total of 8 distinct dishes. For those considering the tasting menu, be warned – it's a culinary marathon, so come hungry.

Words hardly do the meal justice, so I'll let the attached pictures do the talking. While the menu is ever-changing, rest assured that any choice you make is sure to be a winner. Each dish was a hit, contributing to an unforgettable gastronomic journey.",1
10018,"Title: Delicious Treats, Disappointing Service

I recently visited a local eatery renowned for its delightful offerings and left with mixed feelings. The array of mouth-watering options, including self-serve displays, were as pleasing to the eye as they were to the palate, and the prices didn’t break the bank. The highlight of my visit was the chocolate chip twists, which came fresh and scrumptiously packed in a quaint box of six.

However, the experience was soured by the lackluster service. The staff seemed disengaged, lacking the warmth and attentiveness that completes a dining experience. As a newcomer, I felt overlooked by employees who favored chatting with locals over providing a welcoming atmosphere. This indifference made me reconsider my purchase, even though I ultimately gave in to my hunger.

In the end, despite the culinary appeal, the unenthusiastic service was a letdown, costing the restaurant two stars in my book. Regrettably, I won't be returning. A reminder to all: never underestimate the power of good customer service.",1
16642,"Made a reservation a week in advance and glad we did. It was freezing rain and almost fell down on the sidewalk. Everyone in the area was wanting to get some Ramen.Server was so on the ball and knew all details about every item. It was fun, ordered pork buns, potato caviar (interesting name), fried chicken, the house special chicken Paitan ramen, and the tonkotsu beef Tsukemen.Everything was prepared and cooked beautifully. It was a high energy place was excellent tasting food.Had to take most of it to-go and made a nice late afternoon snack.",0
10634,"I came to Rahi twice and it's my favorite upscale modern Indian restaurant. The only dish I repeated was the three mango cod. The coconut mango curry was ridiculously flavorful, not particularly spicy, but a bit sweet from the fresh and pickled mangos to perfectly compliment the texture of the cod.The Tangra octopus was excellent, but it's really small even as an appetizer. The calamansi aioli was what made the dish stand out, I nearly licked the plate because of it. The Mangalorean duck was presented really well, but was a little bit chewy. However the curry was flavorful along with the cornmeal/black pepper slightly made up for the duck not being as tender.The Banana leaf chicken was very similar to a tikki masala and the chicken was very tender. My only gripe was that I would have liked not having to take the chicken off the chicken leg. I'd recommend coming here for a date night. The service was great as well and they were very attentive.",0
16120,"I had the chance to visit this buzzworthy spot around noon on a Saturday, and to my surprise, the wait was quite reasonable. The ""Spicy Spring"" came highly recommended, so my choice was clear. First impressions were dominated by the sight of those iconic, oil-filled pepperoni cups - every bit as tasty as they look, though two tragically escaped from my slice to the floor. While my usual preference leans towards thinner crusts, the warm, chewy dough of the Spicy Spring won me over, offering a delightful deviation from my norm. For fellow pizza aficionados, this place is a hit when the queue isn't daunting. Make sure to seize the opportunity for a slice if you find yourself nearby.",1
14174,"I recently visited this gem of a restaurant and was thoroughly impressed by their omakase offering. Opting for the Nozawa 'Trust Me' version at an incredibly reasonable $45, the quality exceeded expectations. The assortment of sashimi, nigiri, and hand rolls was not only fresh, but expertly curated. I appreciated that the rice was proportionate, allowing the quality of the fish to take center stage.

The service was notably quick, ensuring a seamless dining experience without compromising on the quality of the food. However, a pro tip for future visitors: try to schedule your visit during off-peak hours. This place is popular, and for good reason, so it's not uncommon to face a few hours' wait during busy times.

In summation, if you're on the hunt for an excellent omakase that won't break the bank, this is the place to go. Fresh ingredients, swift service, and fair pricing make this restaurant a must-visit.",1
11296,"Lovely tapas-style izakaya/yakitori restaurant, with open and modern decor. The menu pictures here look so appetizing and mouth-watering (seriously...how is it possible to make even potato salad look so good?!), and my friends and I had such a hard time settling on what to order.We shared all our dishes family-style. My favorites ended up being the scallop uni carpaccio (scallop sashimi topped with uni and a light and refreshing basil sauce) and their Kani Chowder (cream soup filled with a soft shelled crab, clams, and vegetables; labeled as a winter special). However, none of our dishes disappointed and each one was flavorful and well balanced. There's definitely more on the menu that I'd love to try next time.The restaurant was very busy for a Wednesday night. My group of 3 had about a 45 minute wait, but we took advantage of Yelp's online waiting system and were able to put our name down earlier.",0
2168,"Our dining experience at this restaurant was outstanding, meriting every moment of anticipation. The winter cream of corn soup served as a delectable appetizer, setting a high bar for the meal. The grilled octopus was tender and flavorful, leaving a memorable impression. However, the true star of the evening was the Thai fried rice with seafood—a dish so divine, it demands a return visit. Highly recommended for an unforgettable culinary adventure.",1
2608,"Very good lunch spot with fresh food, and a number of interesting options. Customers choose a main and a few sides.  I do not  usually like a number of different foods in one bowl, so chose my sides carefully.  The wild rice, curry cauliflower and blue potatoes were all very good. The main dish was dry though.  My son enjoyed his chicken and sides.The sauces are also great. The sauce I tried was sweeter and a little creamy, and my son's was spicy with a kick.The servers were friendly. I would return for lunch.",0
13813,"During my latest visit to NYC, I finally had the chance to check out this much-raved-about taco spot, and let me tell you, it did not disappoint. Their tacos, particularly the carne asada and adobado, were a taste sensation with perfectly balanced seasoning – some of the best I've had.

The ordering system was a breeze; despite the queue, the line moved fast. After placing your order at the counter, you hand your ticket to the taco experts, who tailor your order to your preference of tortilla and toppings—corn or flour, with all the traditional garnishes like onion, cilantro, and lush guacamole. For those who love to customize, additional toppings like limes, radishes, and chili peppers are available too.

If you're in the city and craving authentic tacos, make the effort to stop by. It's an experience that's absolutely worth it, and undoubtedly, you'll leave with no regrets.",1
17462,"This is a very cozy small place that offers quick bite. I came here on a Saturday at 1pm and we were the only table, so the service was great and fast. Ordered green curry chicken and a store fried squid. Both taste pretty decent and the price is very affordable. Each dish comes with plain rice. The green curry supposed to be spicy but I think it's less spicy than I expected, even the flavor is great. The stir fried squid is ok, a lot of green pepper and union but not much squid. I also had the duck spring roll which was very delicious. Fresh and straight outta boiler. There are lunch special from Monday to Friday .",0
14585,"Title: Generous Portions and a Charming Vibe

I ventured out during restaurant week to sample the offerings of this delightful dining spot, conveniently nestled near Central Park. The experience was certainly worth the visit. We were greeted with portions generous enough to satisfy the most ravenous of appetites, with a helping of fries ample enough to serve a small gathering.

My choice for the evening was the pate and burger. The pate stood out, creamy and perfect when spread on the accompanying bread—though it was served in a quantity that could easily feed a small party on its own. The burger, while tasty, didn't quite leap out as anything extraordinary.

My companion opted for the mussels, which arrived in a voluminous pot. However, the curry sauce meant to accompany the shellfish settled at the bottom, requiring some excavation to properly enjoy the intended flavor combination.

For ambiance, the restaurant strikes a comfortable balance, making it an ideal location for both a casual catch-up with friends or a laid-back date night. Not overly fancy, yet a step above casual, it's a place I'd return to for its atmosphere as much as for its food.",1
17465,"i really enjoy coming here for their noodles. The soup is pipping hot when served and its just fun ""cooking"" your own noodles with the add-on little dishes.i recently starting trying their appetizers and cold dishes; very good. The spicy cold dishes were not as spicy as the szechuan places in flushing but the FLAVOR was there. The fried foods: popcorn chicken, french fries, tofu were all tasty and served hot as well. Being a lover of fried chicken wings, it was not for me here. Their wings had nicely fried skin but the meat inside was SWEET? my friends suggested the chef swapped the sugar and salt by mistake? LOLOne BIG take away for me is the staff. Not that their service is bad or anything but they give me a ""i dont care vibe"". After you are seated, they throw you the tea/water and you are on your own. You dont get eye contact until you wave them down. They dont even come by to fill the water/tea automatically.To this day i am still wondering about the ""way to order things"" here... do i write on the menu (in a plastic folder) or do i not? LOL there was one time i was snarled at for writing on the folder BUT there is a erasable marker on the table... hmmm.Another issue about the menu is the LACK of it. Half of the time there is NO menu on the table because the table next to us took it when they sat down... staff leaves ONE menu on the table regardless of how many people there are... this doesnt make sense to me. Being a party of 2 or 4 or more, this menu sharing doesnt work out.",0
13883,"Tucked away in the bustling heart of Chinatown, this cozy eatery offers a delightful twist with its Asian fusion cuisine. I indulged in the taco platter featuring a trio of taste – a zesty cheesesteak, a succulent fried pork belly, and a tender grilled steak taco. Each was drizzled with a sauce that truly packed a punch, elevating the flavors wonderfully, especially the pork belly which was a standout.

My companion opted for the breakroom burger, which was equally impressive in taste and portion. The pricing is reasonable, with each of our dishes falling between $10-12, and we left content and comfortably full.

While it might not be a destination we'd travel far for, it is undoubtedly a solid pick for anyone in the Chinatown area looking for fulfilling and tasty Asian fusion fare.

14839,"I honestly did not really see what's so great about this place. I ordered a $3 slice of their original pizza, but it tasted just very very slightly better than the cheap 99 cents pizza found in many various blocks around Manhattan. There was flop in the pizza, and the pizza dough is not that chewy. Their biggest upside is that they close super late, so it is definitely perfect after a big night out and you're trying to satisfy some late night cravings. If it's within reasonable hours where other places are open, I would definitely check those other places out first. Besides, this place is cash only.",0

I loved that we were given tap and sparkling water, something I've never seen at other restaurants. They have a wide variety of brunch options and we had quite the spread. I got the eggs Benedict with smoked salmon instead of ham. I wasn't extremely impressed as it was average - the eggs had a strong taste of vinegar which is how they probably poached the eggs, not the most appetizing. The rest of the table thoroughly enjoyed their food and I left wishing I had decided to venture out and try something new as opposed to sticking to the usual brunch foods. I will be back to try out their other more special brunch items!",0
11841,"Title: A Refreshing Culinary Alternative - 94 Corner Cafe

My quest to find a solid backup to my usual haunt led me to 94 Corner Cafe, and it didn't disappoint. This clean and welcoming establishment caters to a range of tastes, adeptly managing custom orders with flair. Their menu is a diverse spread, offering everything from refreshing smoothies, juices, and lattes to savory wraps, pizzas, and fresh salads—all at wallet-friendly prices.

The execution of each dish is commendable, but I tend to steer clear of their bread-based options like rolls and heroes—they're just not to my taste. Instead, I find delight in their non-bread items, particularly enjoying the plentiful and always fresh avocado.

While service can sometimes lag, the Cafe more than makes up for it with consistency and quality. Their extensive selection ensures you'll always find something to satisfy your cravings. All in all, 94 Corner Cafe is a solid choice for anyone looking for reliable and tasty dining options in the area.",1
12968,"It's more of a 3.5 stars than a 4 - for drinks only. If you're looking for a laid back weekend evening, this is the place to go with speakeasy vibes.The reasoning being the limited drinks menu, although the drinks were definitely above average in taste but not different than other cocktail bars I've been to. The spot is a bit hidden, you enter through a graffiti door that leads downstairs. It's a great place to go on a busy weekend, since it's fairly quiet. We were given a spot right away and there was a lot of open space at this bar.The drinks tasted good, especially the one with gin, blueberry and eggwhite. Decor could have some more uniqueness though, too play off the speakeasy vibe.They also have a full dining menu if you're hungry.",0

My partner and I ventured into B&H Dairy on a whim, hoping to satisfy my cravings for traditional Jewish comfort food, and the experience did not disappoint. Having never been to this no-frills spot, I was instantly drawn in by the cozy atmosphere and the promise of wholesome, delicious food.

Despite its diminutive size and the potential for crowds, we found the close quarters to be part of B&H Dairy's charm. The service was refreshingly direct; efficient without sacrificing warmth, creating an ambiance of familiarity right off the bat. 

The latkas I ordered were the epitome of crispy perfection, and the accompanying sour cream and apple sauce only amplified their flavor. As for the matzo ball soup, it was like an embrace for the soul, especially appreciated on the damp evening we visited.

For anyone in search of kosher fare served quickly and with care, B&H Dairy is a must-try. The combination of speedy service, a welcoming environment, and, most importantly, food that delivers both taste and comfort, will have you planning your next visit before you've even finished your meal.",1
18962,"tiny little restaurant. extremely cramped.almost no lighting, completely pitch dark, except the bar.small menu with different ramens including unique options like matcha. the portions were pretty underwhelming given the cost. there's maybe a few pieces of pork and noodles. that's it. no extra fillers etc.",0
20352,"Lions & Tigers stands out as a top pick for when the craving for non-traditional New York pizza kicks in. This gem offers mouthwatering Detroit-style square pizzas that are perfectly cheesy and generously sauced. The menu features irresistible options, with the original, sausage and onions, pepperoni, and the exciting new vodka pizza being personal favorites. Service is welcoming, enhancing the dining experience, while the convenience of ordering through Seamless is an added bonus for those cozy nights in. It's a must-try destination for any pizza enthusiast. Highly recommended!",1
14501,"What a cute place! I love the ambiance here with the open, green interior and friendly waiters. Food is also so good. For a table of 2, we ordered the Meatballs and Quattro Formaggi. The meatballs were good - the marinara was fresh, but the meatball itself could've been more flavorful. The Quattro... so yummy. I love sweet hints in savory dishes, and they executed perfectly with this pizza. The layers of cheese weren't too rich, and the truffle paired really well with the hot honey and figs. Highly recommend if you want something less meaty / savory. Will definitely be ordering again!",0
12595,"Embarking on a culinary adventure at Babs, I found myself enveloped in an oasis of lush green banquettes, immediately setting the tone for the luxurious feast that lay ahead. The creators of Mimi have struck gold again, with Babs impressively sprinting out of the starting blocks.

The experience was close to flawless, with each dish showcasing a level of cleverness and sophistication that tickled the palate. The crab salad was a triumph, elegantly perched atop a potato hash, so perfectly balanced in flavor that my request for pepper and lemon proved superfluous. 

The small sea bream was a revelation, presented with two complementing sauces that enhanced rather than overpowered its delicate char. The tagliatelle, intertwined with clams and speckled with arugula, was another standout, embodying the essence of the sea.

Accompaniments like charred peppers and Bertolli beans were more than just sides; they were co-stars in this gastronomic production. A decadent chocolate mousse cake brought a sweet conclusion to a meal where, true to form, each dish somehow managed to outdo the one before.

At a total of $105, the value was undeniable, especially considering the culinary calibre. One minor caveat—the ambient noise level did rise, which is to be expected in a venue buzzing with satisfied diners. Babs, despite its infancy, has already mastered the art of allure. If it's this lively on a summer restaurant week Tuesday, one can only imagine the clamor for tables in the days to come.",1
16266,"Another great location for a quick lunch at by Chloe. Their salads are really good, reasonably priced ($10.50) and delicious! My favourite is their Kale Caesar Salad with mushroom ""bacon"". My only complaint is that their mushroom ""bacon"" is extremely salty and their sweet potato fries (even though they say are air baked, could be less oily. However, these sweet potato fries are delicious- even though they taste deep fried. Another great dish is their Spicy Thai Salad. Would definitely come back.",0
15334,"I recently revisited a local favorite of mine and was pleased to find that their entrees remain top-notch, with the freshness and flavor I've come to expect. In an exciting update, they've expanded their menu to include new items like the hearty Balkan bean soup 'pasul,' which is a must-try for any food enthusiast. The staff continues to be the epitome of hospitality – friendly and attentive. Plus, the prices are as reasonable as ever, making this gem of a restaurant a place I'll keep coming back to.",1
20143,"This is the original West Village shop of the famous Joe's Pizza in New York City.  It long ago became famous for its pizza by the 'slice.'  I've heard sometimes the owner & founder Pino ""Joe"" Pozzuoli shows up here to work in the kitchen. One thing is for sure....it is always busy.But I absolutely did not find any thing special about the pizza. The consistency of the crust was limp, the ingredients totally ordinary, and it costs a lot more than other slices in NYC.  Perhaps my standards for pizza have risen significantly over the last few years with all the tasty pizzas I have eaten in Philly & Vienna & other cities including New York.  I know NYC takes pride in its pizza and I'm always happy to see traditions like Joe's survive and thrive, but I'll check out other pizzas or slices in the future.",0
11173,"Seriously everything we ate was so delicious. Duck liver soup was so simple and decadent, the broth was so rich and light brussel sprout leaves added the perfect veggie balance. The leeks were probably our favorite, so good we were all fighting over the last bite. Ghost of Mary was basically a clarified martini style bloody Mary was so delicious and the tomato stuffed olive in it was a welcome treasure. So glad we made this stop! Cute little spot as well",0

10881,"Haven't been here in awhile and I heard they changed management. I was craving their sukiyaki so my husband and I came here during the week for a quick lunch. It was a complete failure and as bad as a lunch experience can get. Our waiter was taking away finished dishes from table next to us and spilled leftover soup all over my husband's coat. Strike one. I ordered sukiyaki of course, because that's what I came here for. 15min later, my husband's lunch came and mine didn't. Another 5 min later, the same waiter who spilled soup on my husband's coat brought a complete different dish and wanted to put in front of me. Strike two and I said no. Another 5 minute passed, he came back with the same non-sukiyaki dish and said sorry your sukiyaki is sold out. Strike three and I was flabbergasted. Had to talk to the manager. I bumped it up from 1 Star to 2 because of the manager was very sincere and apologetic. He explained that the waiter was brand new, and had put my sukiyaki to the wrong table and that person started eating it and that was the last sukiyaki set. Now with that said, the waiter was also the same person spilled soup on my husband's coat. On top of that, if you made a mistake, don't just bring a random dish to me assuming I'd take it without explaining to me what happened. I mean how many mistakes can one person make in one day. Once again, the manager was apologetic and comped our lunch plus future three sukiyakis. The thing is, I don't know if I will ever come back here after being wounded this much during one visit.",0
12164,"After nearly half a century of patronage, I can testify that this restaurant remains a paragon of consistency. While the wait staff has naturally evolved over the decades, the core experience—enormous portions, impeccable service, and remarkable value—has steadfastly endured. The sangria continues to be a palate-pleasing delight, perfectly complementing the generous entrees, which are easily shareable with leftovers to spare. A nod to tradition, they maintain a cash-only policy, eschewing credit and debit cards. This place is an enduring classic that keeps me coming back.",1
11604,"I've frequented this establishment numerous times primarily for their exceptional drinks. Although on the pricey side, they never disappoint. The bar staff deserves special mention; they're simply fantastic. Once, they humorously indulged my friend and me – and even a plant we impulsively purchased while tipsy – making our experience memorable. We accidentally left our green companion behind, yet the accommodating staff ensured it was there for us upon our return. Kudos to the entire team for their excellent service and for consistently creating such a welcoming atmosphere.",1
18608,"Dining at this culinary gem in Chinatown is an experience for the bold palate—where the zest of authentic Szechuan meets the robust tradition of Cajun seafood boil. The fusion is surprising yet incredibly harmonious. Each dish is a testament to the kitchen's fantastic execution, especially the spicy popcorn chicken that never fails to delight. The sheer size and meatiness of the claw fish are standout features, making it a seafood lover's dream. The staff complements the excellent food with their attentive and friendly service, ensuring a memorable meal from start to finish.",1
20209,"Shoo Shoo is one of a growing number of Mediterranean restaurants opening in Manhattan showing New Yorkers what hummus really is supposed to taste like. Happily, Shoo Shoo is more than just about hummus. The cocktails, the atmosphere and the service are all excellent. The food is very good and very much like what you would find in Israel. The vibe is a lot like Tel Aviv with a clearly younger crowd. We've been for both brunch and dinner and will be back.",0
12932,"Came here for restaurant week with two friends. The food was presented beautifully and cooked to perfection as you'd expect from a Japanese restaurant. Service was efficient and attentive. We got the soft shell crab karage, chicken thighs, cod, and both of the desserts. The meal also comes with complimentary miso soup and salmon roll. It was  enough food for us but if you're super hungry (or a guy with a bigger appetite) you'll like need to order something else a la carte. What I love the most about this place is that you really do get privacy because they have these curtains that divide tables of two and also these spaces that can sit six. It's not as tight as some spaces you'd get in midtown. I'd definitely be back to try other things on the menu!",0
17276,"Title: Underwhelmed by Style Over Substance

Despite my excitement to dine at this restaurant, the experience left me feeling underwhelmed. The interior charmed me with its delightful decor, setting high expectations that, sadly, were not met by the meal that followed.

The menu was pricey, and although the food was passable, it failed to justify the cost. The fries and calamari reached only the heights of mediocrity, while the chicken marsala was not only undercooked but also lacked the richness in flavor one would anticipate from such a dish.

A particular letdown was the tea selection. For an establishment that boasts high tea, especially at their Times Square venue, the range was disappointingly basic, offering no more than the common earl grey, chamomile, and peppermint varieties. Receiving the same peppermint tea I might drink at work, and at no cost there, only cemented my disenchantment.

In summary, the restaurant is a charming space, but when it comes to the culinary experience, it's merely average and not worth the premium.",1
2885,"Title: Fresh Fare with a Side of Slow Service at New Local Spot

I recently visited a new restaurant in the neighborhood for lunch and came away with mixed impressions. My colleague and I opted for the sashimi lunch and a two maki roll combo, each accompanied by miso soup and salad. The sashimi delighted us with its freshness and exemplary preparation, while the maki rolls were generously filled, leaving us quite satisfied.

A pleasant surprise was the complimentary tiramisu and jelly dessert, courtesy of a Yelp check-in – a sweet ending to our meal!

However, not everything was up to par. The service dampened our experience – slow and lagging, it turned our expected one-hour lunch into a bit of a time crunch, forcing us to rush back to work. Additionally, while the open kitchen concept piqued my interest, it fell short with poor ventilation, leaving us carrying the kitchen's odors with us for the rest of the day.

In conclusion, while the food was a hit, the service and atmosphere left room for improvement. I might revisit to see if things get better, but it’s not at the top of my list for a return lunch break.",1
12423,"Title: A Culinary Triumph Amidst NYC's Tapas Scene

I recently patronized an exceptional tapas restaurant in New York City, a resounding palate cleanser from a previous lackluster dining experience elsewhere. This establishment not only met but exceeded my gastronomic expectations with a menu that was nothing short of spectacular. 

Upon arrival, the promise of tapas and sangria had my taste buds tingling, and the reality did not disappoint. The cheese and meat trays were a delightful introduction, each bite more compelling than the last. The bacon-wrapped delicacies and croquettes were a testament to how simple ingredients can be transformed into culinary artistry.

The highlight, however, was the surprise birthday treat—Nutella Churros, courteously offered by the attentive waiter. This sweet gesture was the perfect capstone to an already delightful meal.

Returning the following day, I indulged in a full pitcher of rich, ruby Tinto Sangria, which proved to be the perfect accompaniment to another round of impeccable fare. Additionally, the cleanliness of the kitchen did not go unnoticed. The spotless counters and meticulous attention to food safety were so impressive that one could confidently undergo surgery on them, a testament to the chef's commitment to excellence.

In conclusion, this restaurant stands out as a jewel in NYC's vibrant dining landscape, earning a rousing round of kudos for the chef and the entire team. It's a must-visit for anyone seeking an extraordinary tapas experience accompanied by the perfect sangria.",1
15119,"I came in with a friend and had the prix fixe menu ($55/person) and I was blown away. A Michelin star guide noodle star, it definitely lived up to its expectation. The service was great, the servers were attentive and really kind. There wasn't a wait when I went (5pm on a Thursday). But around 7ish, there were a few parties waiting on line. The prefix menu consisted of 6 dishes: the toros ssam bap, jeju chicken wings, soft tofu w/ truffle (sorry I couldn't find the name of the dish online), prime ribeyes ssam, and finally the So Ramyun. For dessert, we got both chocolate and raspberry ice cream. I believe that the prix fixe menu starts only works with another individual, in my case I lucked out because my friend wanted to do the prix fixe menu as well. Everything came out relatively quick and in a bowl that was shareable for the both of us. I was pretty much tapping out by the 4th dish and thought that I couldn't make it to the ramyun. I would definitely recommend the So Ramyun, it is creamy and milky beef bone broth. It reminded me of Seollongtang broth my mom would make for me during the cold winter months. I would 10/10 recommend this ramyun. Overall, I was pretty satisfied with my experience. Would I come here again? Yeso",0
10228,"After a harbor boat ride by TopView tours to see lady Liberty- my girl crew of four was hungry and didn't want to walk far for food.  Located in the Brookefield Place mall in the financial district, the restaurant wasn't too busy so we dipped in.  I was Leary because of previous ratings, but all in all food was decent and the other ladies seem to enjoy.  I would agree that it was pricey for what you get- for example I had a glass of rose wine $12 and fried zucchini (straws on a bed of fried herbs of sage/mint/rosemary/basil) for $9.  The total with tip (I was always do 20+%) was $28.  I tasted my friend chicken Parmesan and she thought it was good but the bread could have been better.  The big winner among us was the garlicky Parmesan fries- very delicious.  The other lady had the arugula salad $14 and I wouldn't say it was substantial ( fit and balsamic dressing). The last lady had the Ortezky? (Beef and mozzarella) and it was huge and she said no complaints.  Overall it was good.",0
18305,"I recently dined at a local gem that left a lasting impression. From the moment we walked in, the experience was noteworthy, with our attentive and comically charming wait staff promptly escorting us to our table. The culinary delights that followed were nothing short of spectacular – each dish was bursting with flavor and served at remarkably reasonable prices.

The meal was presented on a cart, a novel touch that ensured all dishes arrived simultaneously, perfectly hot and fresh. Portion sizes were generous to the point where, despite my best efforts, I couldn't quite finish everything on my plate – a testament to the value offered.

I wholeheartedly recommend this restaurant for any meal; it's a place that clearly prioritizes customer satisfaction and quality dining experiences.",1
1619,"I first visited Old Tbilisi Garden in the summer and again recently. At the time my friends and I ordered the dumplings and the cheese bread boat and was pretty much done for, for the night. It is quite filling (but so delicious) so eat with caution! In my recent trip, I felt I had a more comprehensive tasting. My meal included the Georgian salad, beet salad, Georgian tasting board, cheese bread and a chicken dish I cannot really, but it was creamy garlic good. As someone who doesn't like beets, interestingly enough I enjoyed the dish, which says something. We also ordered a bottle of Georgian wine which I had not tried before. The garden space at the restaurant is a cool place to dine, a bit of an escape from the city. Service is also attentive. I highly recommend giving Old Tbilisi Garden a try!",0
10250,"I recently visited this gem of a restaurant, which is conveniently located just a brisk six-minute walk from my office. Despite its popularity during the lunch rush, the patrons maintain a commendable level of civility while ordering and waiting. The establishment thoughtfully offers two separate lines for payment - one for card and cash, another for card only, which helps streamline the process.

My go-to dishes are the F4, an exquisite offering of dumplings, and the mouthwatering Spicy Cumin Lamb Noodles. Both options have never failed to impress. This spot is a reliable choice for any food enthusiast looking for a delightful meal close to work.",1
13321,"Bottom line: small, clean, organized little spot for delicious sushi. All ordered via touchscreens on the wall.

Small amount of chairs on the right. The rolls are freshly made and outright delicious. A whole lot of freshness. Everything looks outright spotless. We will 1000% be back for more sushi.",0
14508,"Title: Worth the Wait for Quality Korean BBQ

I visited this restaurant on a bustling Sunday night and confronted an intimidating wait time, even with online check-in, culminating in an extra 20-minute wait upon arrival. Despite this, the restaurant’s spacious interior set the stage for an exceptional dining experience.

The meal commenced promptly with the arrival of our beef platter, an impressive spread of kalbi, prime ribeye, beef thin skirt, and beef brisket. Accompanying the main course was an array of side dishes including steamed egg, crisp lettuce, punchy kimchi, onion, and marinated bean sprouts adding a variety of flavors and textures to our meal. Between the choice of a bean paste soup and a soft tofu stew, we opted for the latter, which complemented the barbecue nicely.

Service was attentive as our server expertly manned the grill, ensuring our meats were cooked to perfection. The four beef varieties were delectable, with the ribeye standing out as the star. Dips were plentiful, with three different sauces to enhance the meats' natural flavors.

In conclusion, this eatery offers a genuine Korean BBQ experience with quality food and generous portions, particularly the beef platter suitable for two. Be prepared for a higher price point and significant wait times during peak hours, but rest assured, the quality is worth the patience.",1
18074,"Title: A Rustic Brunch Delight at The Wren

I eagerly ventured to The Wren for their Saturday brunch, enticed by the prospect of indulging in their French toast. Upon arrival at 11:45 AM, we were greeted by the cozy allure of dim lighting, wooden accents, and soothing scents courtesy of soy candles—perfectly setting the scene for a relaxed meal.

Service was prompt, with menus presented on charming mini wooden boards, complementing the restaurant's rustic theme. After a brief wait, I eagerly anticipated my French toast; however, the dish that arrived was unexpectedly innovative. Instead of traditional brioche, it artfully combined Granny Smith apples with a cake-like bread, enveloped in the warm embrace of cinnamon.

Each bite was a delightful surprise, the toast dissolving like a flavorful cinnamon-apple cloud on the palate. The accompanying cream cheese frosting, though abundant, was a perfect mate, enhancing the dish's richness. Despite its deliciousness, the density proved to be a challenge, and the repetitive taste eventually begged for something to cut its sweetness.

Thankfully, occasional savory interludes from their sriracha sausage sandwich provided the necessary contrast to my meal. Overall, The Wren delivered a memorable brunch experience with its creative twist on a classic. Highly recommended for those in the area seeking a tranquil and tasty morning retreat.",1
18548,"As someone who works nearby and frequents this establishment, it's disappointing to report a noticeable decline in quality. Opting for the lunch special, the drunken noodles with shrimp, I was underwhelmed to find a mere three shrimps in my dish, an upgrade that cost an extra $1.50 compared to the generously meat-filled chicken option. Moreover, the shrimp didn't match the size one might expect from a Chinese eatery, which typically provides four. The execution of the dish fell short, with the seasoning leaving a gritty aftertaste reminiscent of undercooked spices. Additionally, the spring roll accompanying the meal was overladen with grease. Unfortunately, this experience has dissuaded me from planning a return visit in the foreseeable future.",1
16401,"I absolutely adore Ruibosa! The food is phenomenal, truly top-tier in flavor and quality. Service matched the high culinary standards, leaving nothing to be desired. It's worth noting that it's a unique gem with only one location, so it's advisable to make a reservation to avoid the lengthy waits, which are the only downside due to the spot's popularity.

You really can't make a misstep whether you choose one of their pastas or pizzas. A stand-out item is the signature Tie-Dye pizza, boasting a mesmerizing blend of vodka, tomato, pesto, and fresh mozzarella that is as delicious as it is Instagram-worthy.

Ruibosa has won me over, and I'm already planning my next visit. It's also the perfect place to impress out-of-town guests with a taste of local culinary excellence.",1
18906,"If you are really craving some barbecue in East Village and don't mind spending a bit of money, I'd recommend eating here. I got the half pound burnt ends sandwich which is even bigger than the single serving sandwich but it was not filling enough for a whole meal, so I'd recommend you order some sides as well. The quality was much better than I expected for a chain in NYC though, so I might come back sometime.",0
11862,"The 6 of us visited Han Bat in K-Town on a Thursday evening of January.The staff was very accommodating, and the restaurant was not so busy around 6:30 pm, which made it possible for us to pick the table of our choice. Usually, the busy restaurants would only seat us only when the whole party is present, but Han Bat was not so strict.... which made it even more appealing for us.However .... the food can be a different story. We ordered seafood pancake, ttuk-bo-kki (spicy rice cake), jokbal (pork hocks), soo-yuk (pork belly slices), soybean paste stew, soft tofu stew.Check in and get 4 steamed dumplings which were very well made !!! Not store bought at all !!!!! Major disappointment : The jokbal (pork hocks) was COLD !!!! Usually, this dish is served warm and soft. Apparently, when inquired, Han Bat serves it COLD, and would not ""heat/stir fry"" for us even after requested. So, we ended up having a few pieces only ...Soybean paste stew was too ""sweet"" for us, and soft tofu stew lacked the deep flavor ""umami"".Next time we are gathering there, we should definitely try other dishes !!!But the ""soo-yuk"" was really worth it !!!

The place is very tight and cramped so keep that in mind if you come in at a busy hour!The dishes were absolutely delicious! So flavorful and they used good quality ingredients. I got the pad see ew with chicken, and they give huge portions! The service was great as well and we truly enjoyed our dinner. I definitely want to come back and try more of the dishes, but the cramped waiting definitely makes me hesitate a little. One good thing to note however is that they seem to be able to accommodate lone diners very easily. I have no problem with dining alone so maybe that'll be the plan!",0
19687,"I recently visited this spot for a friend's birthday, opting to share various small dishes among our group. The char siu bbq baby back ribs and hoisin hakka noodles stood out for their flavor but left me contemplating the value given their steep prices and modest portions, which seemed more suited to the establishment's bar food niche. While our party didn't indulge in beverages, the vibrant atmosphere suggests it would be an excellent place for drinks. I might return for a cocktail or two during a special event, but the food alone wouldn't beckon me back.",1
18495,"Title: A Slice Above the Rest in the Big Apple

Don't let the unassuming façade fool you; this pizzeria is a slice of heaven tucked away in the bustling streets of New York. As a seasoned pizza aficionado, I've embarked on many a late-night quest for the perfect cheesy indulgence, and I can assert with confidence that this spot truly stands out.

What sets it apart is not just the claim of being the ""best pizza in New York""—a title many lay claim to—but the undeniable truth of it. Whether you're a local with a discerning palate or a visitor caught by a pizza craving, you'll find satisfaction here.

Each pizza, irrespective of the variety you choose—and there are plenty—is a fresh, flavorful journey. The ingredients taste like they were picked just for your slice, and the crafted dough is the perfect foundation for what I can only describe as a masterclass in pizza excellence.

The experience isn't just about filling a gap; it's about delighting in every bite, knowing that you're getting your money's worth and then some. From the casual diner to the inebriated connoisseur seeking solace at the end of a long night, this shop is the definitive destination for pizza in New York.",1
11589,"In NYC for the weekend! I came in for a quick bite with my friend. We shared a pizza by the slice of the Chicken Broccoli pizza.  It was a little dry and the flavor of the sauce and toppings were bland and mainly tasted like cheese.  I wasn't a big fan. Their topping options were limited as well. There were the basics: Cheese, Pepperoni, Mushroom and Spinach,  etc.. I would probably try another pizza place next time from all the NY Pizza options around the city!",0
2681,"**Title: A Sake Haven in the East Village**

If you're a sake enthusiast, look no further than this gem in the East Village. There are good restaurants, and then there's this place, where the term 'excellent' feels like an understatement. The service? Incredibly warm. The food? Nothing short of extraordinary. But let's talk about the main event: the sake selection. It's akin to the vast offerings one might expect in Tokyo's best spots, like Nurukan Sato – extensive and impressive.

Imagine every type of sake you've dreamed of exploring, all under one roof. This place delivers that experience without the need for a plane ticket to Japan. Granted, the prices reflect its New York City setting, but for the quality and variety, it's entirely justified. In short, if you're serious about sake and exceptional dining, this East Village haunt is a must-visit. Cheers to that!",1
201,"I LOVE THIS SPOT. Best Hong Kong food ever. I go here almost every week for a comfort meal. Cha Chan Teng's are basically Hong Kong style diners. The food here is unrivalled.

Everything is good. AND SO CHEAP.",0
19171,"Finally tried this place again years later and it is not as good as I remembered it. Either that or maybe I just ordered the wrong thing. We started out with some Greek meatballs and Greek fries. The Greek meatballs were great, especially with the tzatziki sauce it came with. However, the fries could have used something to dip them in as well. We started using the tzatziki for it. For my main, I had the lamb burger. I liked that it was served with pita instead of a regular bun. I also liked the roasted tomatoes and the beet slaw. However, the lamb was a bit dry. With so many other Greek options in the city, I'm not sure I'll be back a third time.",0
18927,"Came here for dinner with some friends after taking a stroll around the newly opened hudson yards. This is pretty out of the way with really only the 7 train nearby, not the greatest location in my opinion. When you walk in, you're immediately impressed by the decor, it's super cute, but everything else is lackluster. When we came in at 6:30, there was only 1 table, and by the time we left, there were 3. Not sure where they're getting the 4 stars from...Their biggest issue is definitely their pricing/portions. We ordered a guacamole to share and an entree for ourselves. When the guacamole came, I was shocked at the size. If you look at the pictures I posted, it's smaller than the size of my palm. It's literally a dollop of guacamole, with 4 chips. Flavor is good, but my goodness, $16 for that?! Crazy, even for NYC. This guacamole better have some caviar or uni on top of it to be that price... No wonder the waitress asked us if we wanted any additional appetizers...I ordered the Barbacoa tacos for my entree, which were also $16. These were 3 TEENY TACOS. I'm pretty petite and I think these are freakin tiny. I can't imagine what a guy would do dining here. Flavor was just OK, nothing special. My husband ordered the organic chicken $26, I didn't get to taste the chicken, but I did try a bite of their arroz verde - it was extremely dry and undercooked, super grainy still.Don't think I'd be back again due to location/food/price, this would've been an amazing date spot with the ambiance they have! Maybe they should pivot into a fancy bar instead...",0
2522,"Title: A Culinary Gem Worth the Reservation

From the moment we stepped into this bustling eatery, it was evident why reservations are a must. With a cozy arrangement of 10 tables and additional outdoor seating to enjoy in pleasant weather, the atmosphere caters both to romantic outings and casual gatherings with friends.

Our culinary journey commenced with an array of appetizers that set a high bar for the evening. The octopus salad was a standout, its grilled tentacles bursting with flavor. Paired with tuna tartare complemented by a dollop of guacamole, and the comfortingly decadent cheese gnocchi, which could rival any mac and cheese, the starters were a hit.

As for the main course, the grilled branzino was a delight. However, the star of the show was the mixed seafood grill – a dazzling assortment of grilled shrimp, scallops, salmon kabob, and tuna slider – each piece was succulent and seasoned to perfection.

Though the accompanying chopped salad was fresh, it could easily be swapped for a more adventurous side or tapa. To round off the meal, the bread pudding stole the spotlight, an exquisite balance of creaminess and fluff, while the sorbet provided a refreshing cleanse to the palate.

The wine selection impressed as well, providing a smooth accompaniment to the flavorsome feast. This place is a must-visit for anyone seeking an extraordinary dining experience. It comes highly recommended, and rightfully so!",1
20437,"This place looks rather unassuming from the outside, but don't let that fool you. It's actually decently sized and very cozy on the inside. Came here on a rainy day after craving some soup-based to eat. I got the lunch special unagi combination, which consisted of cold soba noodles, eel over rice and several pieces of sashimi. I was blown away by the quality of the food! The soba noodles were chewy and managed to grab onto the flavors of the soup, which was rather mild and clean. It paired nicely with the eel over rice. The eel was nicely seasoned and melts in your mouth. Just wished there were more pieces because it was so tasty. The sashimi is great too. Very fresh. This place is a hidden gem. Would definitely come back again.",0

The authenticity of the place was amplified by our Irish waitress, adding a genuine touch to the experience. A pleasant surprise was receiving a complimentary shot of Fireball upon checking in on Yelp. I opted for the chicken quesadilla, which turned out to be a solid choice, while my buddy indulged in several IPAs, which he evidently relished. Overall, this spot is a great find for anyone looking for a bit of Irish hospitality in the heart of Manhattan.",1
2417,"Best lunch spot for sure! $15 gets you one entree and a beer. I always get the grilled chipotle chicken sandwich with no bacon.

Xe May puts their own twist on the traditional banh mi with combinations like the Lam'bretta (coconut curry lamb) and the Sidecar (grilled beefsteak with pineapple chutney). A vegetarian/vegan option is also available in the Mean Green (portobello with spiced tofu and a cauliflower spread on a whole wheat baguette). We got the Hog (grilled pork with fried shallots) and the Pilot (lemongrass chicken) and enjoyed both of them. Crispy baguettes and generous fillings of meat and fresh veggies; what more can you ask for in a good banh mi.,0
10430,"Came for lunch in the tavern section, and my party of 3 was in and out within 50 minutes- there was no weekday lunch rush at 12:20pm. In addition to the celebratory dinners this place seems to be popular for, Gramercy Tavern is also a great place for a fancier but not-too-time-consuming lunch break!This is one of those classy places with individual, machine washable hand towels in the bathroom and servers who will neatly fold your napkins for you when you leave the table momentarily. My friends and I, in our t-shirts and jeans, didn't fit the bill for their usual clientele, but everybody we encountered was pleasant nonetheless. As a bonus, tip is included in the prices listed on the menu!You start the meal with complimentary (focaccia?) bread. I loved this bread. It was cheesy, a bit crispy on the outside but fluffy on the inside. I just wish it was still warm and a bit less oily. They normally start you with one generously-sized piece, but I ended up unashamedly asking the server for more and ate four pieces. The server could tell I really liked it and offered to pack some to-go for me. I decided to decline, though I was definitely tempted. For my entree, I got the sea bream. Great choice for a lighter lunch (or if you want to save room for their delicious bread). The fish was tender and vegetables flavorful. It was a bit too salty for my tastes but still very good. My two friends got the tavern burger, and they both said it's one of the best burgers they've ever had (featured on the Buzzfeed Worth It Secret Menu episode). One of them has been here 3 times and has gotten the burger every time.",0
14417,"Came to HCC to satisfy my craving for dakgalbi upon reminiscing and thinking about my last trip to Korea. Unfortunately the food here does not compare to Korea but it does satisfy the craving.  HCC is located on the second floor, however I noticed there were no door bells or a call button to get into the building. Luckily someone was in the hallway and let us in but I'm unsure of how others would get in otherwise. I appreciate that the restaurant isn't super cramped like others in ktown. We ordered the cheese dakgalbi. Note that the minimum order is 2 servings. With our add-ons of rice cake, sweet potato tempura, and kimmari - this could comfortable feed about 3-4 people. They did mess up our order slightly and gave us ramen when we didn't ask for it. We still had to pay for it, but it was whatever. When the plate first came out it was quite underwhelming  - no sizzling hot plate or anything. Just a room temp plate of food. Granted the food is cooked at the table, it took about 10 minutes for the plate to get hot and we were just sitting there waiting awkwardly for the food to heat up. The food was pretty dry so we had to ask the waiters for more sauce and they gladly got more and mixed it in for us. I definitely recommend the fried rice at the end. It takes up the flavors of the plate and is probably my favorite part. All in all, not the best dakgalbi I've ever had but it does satisfy the craving.",0
20335,"Kaoru has quickly become our top Japanese dining spot in Manhattan, enchanting us with its delectably fresh sashimi don. The value is incredible, particularly for the quality on offer. My go-to picks, the uni bowl and chirashi bowl, boast generous portions that challenge even my appetite. Highly recommended for an authentic and satisfying culinary experience!",1
12330,"This is a classic brunch spot with a wide range of brunch options that are high quality. I got grilled chicken salad which came in a generous portion size and it was delicious! My parents got pastrami hash breakfast and tuna melt which were both really yummy. The potato chips that came with the tuna melt was alright, but the sandwich itself was really great. Although it's slightly on a pricier side, this can be a go-to brunch spot if you want to take anyone who's visiting nyc to a solid brunch place. There's always a long wait though, so expect to wait before you get seated!",0
12502,"The food here was good but the service wasn't. They waited a good 20 minutes to tell us they ran out of beyond burgers, which happens but they had already made everyone's food before they came and told us. So when I had to pick something new I just got a normal burger and we asked how long that would take the food now out of curiosity. The sever was rude about it and told us a while because I ordered a normal burger as If it was my fault they ran out of food. They never checked on us either. I mean it's New York I know the people aren't the nicest but I didn't think that meant restaurants too. The food however was delicious so at least there's that! And the portions weren't ridiculous either which I also appreciated!",0
11811,"During a late-night layover at Penn Station, I found a hidden gem perfect for solo diners like me: a quaint eatery with individual booths offering privacy and comfort. The establishment was welcomingly quiet, ensuring no wait time, and thoughtful amenities like a water fountain and coat rack added to the convenience. Opting for the standard tonkotsu ramen with an added egg over the pricier recommended set, my wallet thanked me. The noodles were delightfully firm, and the creamy broth hit the spot. The portion initially seemed small, but a complimentary noodle refill coupon came to the rescue, rounding out the meal nicely. Price-wise, my bill didn't break the bank and felt justified for the quality received. For those on a tight schedule, this spot is a fantastic choice when you're dining alone and craving a satisfying, swift meal.",1
13900,"Came here for my birthday earlier this year. We made a reservation and got to the restaurant right on time. However, we were still told to wait and grab a drink at the bar. We waited for about 20 mins. I'm definitely not happy with that because the whole point of making a reservation in advance is to avoid all that waiting time. Once we are seated, I noticed the distance between dining tables are very close, and the restaurant itself is noisy. It's definitely not the best option if you are looking for a more intimate experience, but I'd recommend for the group. The food is a little above average, but definitely not the best. For the dessert, we ordered the chef's choice because it looks so pretty I have to get it. But it turned out to be just a bunch of sweets, like popcorn, cookies, and cake pop, etc. Definitely not worth getting it. Overall, it's a place I'm happy I tried, but will definitely not go back.",0
10589,I Came back here and tried the Caribbean wrap. Service was fast and friendly and restaurant was clean. There is seating available.the wrap took about 15 minutes so if you don't want to wait call ahead to pick up as everything is made fresh and takes some time. The quantity and quality was good. The location is perfect as you have connections to the A train. I'm happy to see more healthier options on Broadway. They have a variety of foods to offer. If you want something light they have juices as well. This is also recommended for vegans.  if you're looking for a good breakfast or lunch I would definitely stop by in. They do take cards but they also have an ATM machine available.,0
11457,"I've been trying to order a lot of different foods for delivery or takeout while deployed to NYC for COVID coverage.  I really WANTED to love this food.  I TRIED to justify the food.  I can't.  I ordered asa tibs, which is supposed to be tilapia marinated in onion, garlic, turmeric, and jalapeño.  I expected juicy, moist fish full of flavors.  What I got was fish that the fork would not even pierce, which was burnt and over fried.  I am not exaggerating when I say it was utterly inedible.  I even googled asa tibs to see if maybe I was just uneducated on how this dish was to be cooked, but none of the dishes was cooked in such a manner.  I was so disappointed.  It came with two sides, including shiro wot, a ground roasted split pea sauce that I found full of intense flavors, and I really did like that.  It also came with tikil gomen, or cabbage and carrots.  This was ok, but could have used more seasoning/flavoring.  The order also came with a large order of injera, a crepe-like Ethiopian bread.  It wasn't my personal style, but I can't speak to whether it was good, as I've never had it before.I want to try this place again, but I can't stand the thought of spending that much money to risk getting something inedible.",0
11593,"It has been over a decade since I've been at Caliente Cab. When I was a college student I would go here for after work drinks and happily leave (toasted) with a the famous Caliente Cab glass cup. I was meeting friends for a congratulatory drinks and appetizers. I got there a little late, but they were still seated even though I was missing. A load has changed inside and the big hat in the front is no longer there. To start there is a long line to get inside, the interior is so festive and colorful. I love it! there's actually a tremendous amount of space by the bar, outside seating, next to the bar, on top the landing. It's a new Caliente Cab and I like it. Onto the drinks - I had a passion fruit mojito and the big WHOOPER size drink with 6 straws plus 8 shots. OMG! the waitress Laura was so patient with us while we decided on food and drinks and more drinks. There were only (6) of us and she did not break a sweat. I tried the fried calamari from someone's plate and it was good, I ordered the fried shrimp and sampled a little of everyone's food. HAHAHAHAHAHA! Everything was made with love. I plan on visiting but I may just take an Uber there, parking is not ideal in the Village. ENJOY I know I did!",0
19874,"I recently visited a fast food vegan spot at Rockefeller Center, lured in by the trendy location. Regrettably, the experience left much to be desired. The concept of fast, vegan food is promising, yet the execution here was lackluster. The vegan burger was a disappointment: a tiny patty reminiscent of lower-quality fast food chains, messily dressed with an abundance of toppings to disguise its insubstantial nature. It failed to deliver on the essence of what a burger should be, regardless of dietary preference.

The fries didn't fare much better, coming across as limp and unappetizing. It seems the restaurant's main achievement is its prime location rather than its culinary offerings. Initially, I felt generous with a three-star rating, but upon reflection, that evaluation was overly kind for what was provided. However, I'll maintain a two-star rating for the establishment's redeeming qualities: its cleanliness, bright and spacious interior, and the staff's somewhat friendly demeanor.",1
13087,"Title: A Buzzing Hotspot for the Corporate Crowd – Maiolino's Delivers on Italian Classics

I recently ventured into Maiolino's on a bustling Tuesday evening around 7:30 pm, and the atmosphere was abuzz with a mix of corporate elites and business professionals unwinding over dinner. As my guest and I squeezed into the intimate and dimly lit space, the effervescent chatter and tantalizing aromas from neighboring tables set the stage for what was to be a promising culinary experience.

Kicking off with the suckling pig hearts bar snack, I found myself pleasantly surprised by their pleasing tenderness and balanced seasoning – a delightful appetizer to whet the palate. The highlight, however, was the main course, featuring a spaghetti alla carbonara and a rich ragu pasta. As a self-professed carbonara enthusiast recently beleaguered by underwhelming renditions elsewhere, Maiolino's rendition came close to hitting the mark. While the pasta leaned towards the firmer side of al dente and the sauce could afford a touch more richness in the form of cheese or an additional yolk, it was still a satisfying dish. The ragu, on the other hand, struck the perfect chord with impeccably textured pasta bathed in a robust and flavorful sauce.

Service was the cherry on top, with our server exemplifying kindness and contributing to an overall great dining experience. While Maiolino's might benefit from a slight tweak here and there, it's a solid choice for anyone in search of authentic Italian fare amidst the city's hustle and bustle.",1
11035,"Waited a bit in a line outside but sounds like that's standard considering it's just a store front. Ordering a whole pie would take 30-45 minutes, so we just opted to pay for individual slices instead which was a bit more expensive. We all got the Sicilian pepperoni square though and it was so good!! It's not really a thin crust pizza and it's not a deep dish but it has a nice thickness in between those.There's a lot of oil on the pizza and you probably need a lot of napkins, either to blot it or to wipe your hands and mouth with because the oil just gets all over. The crust itself was perfectly crispy and yet soft enough too. It didn't taste doughy at all either. My favorite part was probably the pepperonis though!!! The pepperonis are smaller circles but they're just SO crispy, and the pizza makers definitely are generous with the amount they put on top of your slice!!Highly recommend visiting here and grabbing tons of napkins too. Just know there's not really seating inside and be prepared to wait in a line bit. You can enjoy all the awesome photos of celebrities that have come before you though!'",0
16967,"Title: A Mixed Bag with Standout Nachos and Service at Jajaja

My recent visit to Jajaja was a bit of a roller coaster when it came to the food. While I wouldn't say I was bowled over, it's hard to dismiss the experience entirely. The culinary highlight without a doubt was the nachos - a must-try for any future diner. The Chayote fish tacos also deserve a nod, bringing a unique flavor that I genuinely loved.

On the flip side, the sweet potato taco left me feeling rather underwhelmed. It's the one dish that didn't quite hit the mark. But it wasn't all about the food; the wait staff was commendable for their friendliness and attentiveness. They sweetened the deal with an extra dessert, which, along with their relaxed approach as we enjoyed our lengthy conversation, was a big plus in my book.

Overall, the cozy atmosphere and the few standout dishes like the nachos and Chayote tacos are enough to beckon me back. Next time, I'm eyeing the turmeric cauliflower rice, hoping for another pleasant surprise. If you find yourself at Jajaja, settle in for a nice evening - there's enough here to warrant a visit, especially for a laid-back catch-up with friends.",1
14055,"Nice spot for sushi in Flatiron. I went the other night and tried a whole bunch of their dishes. The tuna pizza with avocado spread is pretty tasty (although I wasn't a huge huge fan of the tortilla it was on, the tuna and sauce were good). The karaage with tartar sauce was super tasty, cooked perfectly. My favorite part was the hand roll I ordered- salmon avocado, and seriously delicious, I could've eaten 5. We also got the sushi for 2 (could definitely feed 3), which had a lot of different options. The desserts were pretty good, I liked their mango and green tea mochi a lot (red bean was not exactly flavorful enough for me, but the others were nice). Pretty good place to stop for a weekday sushi night.",0
18254,"Title: A Gem Beyond Brunch – A Delightful Dinner Experience

My visit to this charming eatery surpassed expectations set by its popular Yelp brunch reviews. The dinner truly shone with a thoughtfully curated prix fixe menu priced at a reasonable $45, especially for a farm-to-table experience. Adorable touches like a sourcing map behind the menu added to the charm.

The starter, a comforting chicken and mushroom soup, set a high bar, which the main course, a fresh and perfectly prepared seabass, effortlessly met. The meal concluded with a sublime lemon ricotta cake, leaving me sated and eager for a return visit. Next time, brunch!",1
14685,"Title: New Favorite Spot Just a Block Away!

I can't believe I've been missing out on this gem while frequenting Selena Rosa nearby! Finally tried this place, and it has easily become my new go-to. The outdoor seating is a fantastic touch, especially for those pleasant evenings when you just want to soak in the city vibes.

My boyfriend and I were greeted warmly and seated promptly at around 9:30 pm, with the staff kindly informing us that the kitchen was about to close. Our waitress was incredibly friendly, adding to the welcoming atmosphere.

We opted for the frozen margaritas, which were exceptional – they offer a variety of flavors, and yes, they theatrically light them on fire! It's not just a drink; it's an experience.

The guacamole, prepared table side, was fresh and customized to our spice preference – simply divine. Combined with a hearty portion and the crispy chips, it was a perfect starter. The chicken quesadilla followed suit, delicious and satisfying to the last bite.

And here's a tip – they have a happy hour from 12pm to 7pm every day, which isn't advertised on their website. It's an opportunity I won't miss next time.

Can't wait to return and delve deeper into their menu. It's safe to say that my evenings just got a little more exciting!",1
12585,"Tucked away on the ground floor of the Whitney Museum, Untitled stands out as a delightful tapas gem directly affiliated with the museum. The seasonal menu promises an ever-evolving dining experience. During our visit, the standout service, particularly from our server Ysabella, enhanced the meal—no need for tipping here, as the restaurant adopts a unique pay structure courtesy of the museum.

My friend's choice of a three-cheese plate was a triumph, featuring a zesty lemon marmalade and a delectable cranberry-pecan bread that complemented the robust flavors of Gorgonzola, Brie, and a sharp cheddar. My grilled squid was equally impressive, with shelled beans, shishito peppers, and a zingy red Mizuna salad in a flavorsome marinade.

The atmosphere is as vibrant and artistic as the museum itself—upbeat and cheerful. Untitled is a must-visit for anyone in downtown's west side, museum-bound or not.",1

15655,"Title: Decent Food Overshadowed by Lukewarm Service

I ventured into this eatery with high hopes for a cozy dining experience on a chilly December day. The food indeed lived up to expectations, with delightful pork and crab soup dumplings worth every penny of their $10 price tag. The spicy beef noodle soup was customizable and satisfyingly good, even at $15 with the option for a milder broth. Additionally, the chrysanthemum tea, albeit pricey at $7, rounded off the meal pleasantly.

Regrettably, the service left much to be desired, starting with their refusal to reseat us away from the open door despite the restaurant being nearly empty. The staff exhibited an unwelcoming attitude throughout our visit, which was further soured by a non-disclosed 15% service fee included in the bill – a sneaky move that nearly coaxed us into double tipping.

Although the food was quickly served, the indifferent service prompted my three-star rating. Courteous interactions and transparent billing practices could easily have elevated my experience to a four-star review. As it stands, the delicious offerings are dampened by a need for a warmer, more genuine approach to hospitality.",1
12360,"After a day spent nearby, my companion and I arrived at 5:20pm, just before the 5:30 opening, to beat the anticipated crowd. True enough, a queue had formed, but we managed to nab seats at the sushi bar upon doors opening. With coat hooks within reach, we settled in and were promptly briefed by our server on the recommended order quantities.

Throughout the evening, I indulged in a variety of temaki, including XO scallop, Ebi shrimp, and three grades of uni, opting for the mid-priced option at $16 which was notably fresh. The spicy tuna rice cracker and spicy crab dynamite temaki stood out as favorites, the latter with a warm, creamy texture akin to crab cake.

Although the fish quality was high, the balance often leaned towards excessive rice and an overpowering wasabi presence. The experience wasn't kind to the wallet either; we shelled out over $100 for two, leaving satisfied but not stuffed.

In summary, this restaurant offers quality seafood with attentive service, albeit at a price point that reflects the premium offerings. I would recommend it to sushi enthusiasts looking for freshness and variety.",1
13155,"Title: Searching for the Best Pizza in NYC

On my latest quest for NYC's best pizza, I joined the queue at a trendy spot, enduring a 45-minute wait that seemed promising based on the crowd's enthusiasm. Eager to taste what the hype was about, I opted for their famed spicy spring slice – a Sicilian square boasting pepperoni – and a classic NY-style margherita, the fancy spring.

The Sicilian pepperoni slice delivered; a superb crust laid the foundation for the judiciously spiced sauce and perfectly cooked pepperoni, though a bit more cheese would have made it sublime. Regrettably, the margherita fell flat, quite literally, with its overly crunchy crust reminiscent of cardboard, detracting from the overall experience.

The spicy spring slice was a hit, but I'm torn about whether it justifies another long wait. Solid for the pepperoni, but the search for the ultimate pizza continues.",1
12601,"Finally got the chance to try out their specialty chicken rice today at the new Essex Market. The original location has been open in the East Village for several months. The quarter chicken makes a decent amount of food for the average person. It comes over a bed of their delicious ginger rice, slices of cucumbers, cilantro and 3 of their speciality sauces. I was pretty satisfied with my meal. The chicken wasn't too overly dry. The real stand-out for me was the ginger rice. The sauces and soup that were provided definitely complemented everything wonderfully. I also had an order of their chicken wings just to give it a shot. $5 gets you 2 humongous wings. I'd say skip it, because there wasn't anything truly fascinating about it. It lacked flavor in my opinion.Overall, I'd say give this place a shot if you haven't already!",0
1625,"Dined with two companions at this eclectic eatery and I am still dreaming about their steak – a true masterpiece! Perfectly cooked with a sauce that's the stuff of foodie dreams, it complements the kale and grits to create a mouthwatering dish. I'd rate it beyond perfection if possible. A close second in the flavor race was the truffle Mac and cheese – wonderfully decadent but surprisingly light, thanks to the tapas portion size.

The Korean popcorn chicken was satisfactory, though not remarkable enough to outshine its competition. The soft shell crab caught me off-guard with its appeal, especially since I'm not a big seafood enthusiast. The kimchi paella was middle of the road; it's not something I'd rush back for.

Eager to return, I've got my sights set on trying more of their offerings, especially the Capri Thursday drink special. If you visit, prioritize the steak and Mac and cheese – you won't regret it!",1
18524,"I had high hopes for District Social but unfortunately they came up relatively short. However, I do feel that most things on the menu are either a complete hit or miss so it really depends on what you order. My friend and I came here on a Wednesday night and this place was spacious yet packed which is definitely a good sign. First, if you're looking for a bar where you can have an intimate conversation, or, rather, be able to hear the other person, this isn't the place. Second, if you're looking for good service, I don't think this is the place either so I had to knock off a star. The waiter was not only a bit curt but he also didn't know how to serve a bottle of wine. Literally. He tried to open it repeatedly in front of us for a good five minutes but failed miserably so swapped for a new bottle...twice. On top of that, I'm pretty sure asking for it ""chilled"" doesn't mean serve it lukewarm. This was really off-putting but I would give the food a solid 4/5. The pork belly pizza was a more than adequate portion though the pork was a little too sweet. However, the branzino was absolutely perfect and was cooked perfectly. So, to sum it up, 3.5-4 stars for the food and 2 stars for the service. If it's that difficult to serve a bottle of wine at a bar there's something wrong there.",0
1911,"Title: A Must-Visit for Fried Chicken Aficionados

If fried chicken is your weakness, this eatery is not to be missed. Though I originally opted for the pork chop, which was mouthwateringly good, it was the fried chicken that stole the show. A tantalizing crunch gave way to succulent tenderness, leaving me reaching for more from my companions' plates. The sides round out the meal to perfection, with the collard greens and mac & cheese deserving a special shout-out. In short, make room on your plate for these delectable choices.",1

19139,"Title: A Pleasant Surprise in the Heights

I recently had the pleasure of ordering from a local restaurant that I had frequently passed by but never ventured into. On this occasion, I opted for their poke bowl and was genuinely impressed by the expertly crafted flavor combinations. It was apparent that care and thought had gone into each ingredient, creating a high-quality dining experience that one might typically associate with downtown eateries. The convenience of finding such an establishment in the Heights only added to the satisfaction.

To accompany my meal, I chose a passion fruit juice which struck a perfect balance of flavor without being overly sweet—a refreshing complement to the savory poke bowl.

The only minor hiccup in my experience was a 20-minute wait after placing my order, but the delicious meal that followed proved that good things indeed come to those who wait. Certainly, a spot worth the patience for the tasteful reward.",1

1130,"Title: Superb Seafood Feast at Sup Crab!

I recently ventured into Sup Crab with friends, eager to dive into their renowned seafood offerings. This laid-back joint accommodated us comfortably, flaunting a space perfectly suited for seafood enthusiasts.

As first-timers, we indulged in one of their $99 combos, impeccably designed to satiate two to three people – and it did not disappoint. Our duo found the generous portions challenging to conquer. The meal kicked off with a delightful serving of popcorn chicken, followed by a tough choice between fried chicken, calamari, or Cajun fries – we were already impressed by the variety.

The main event was the seafood boil featuring succulent snow crabs, alongside head-on shrimp and crawfish, all mingling with savory sausage, hearty potatoes, and sweet corn. Each dish was an explosion of flavor, especially when drenched in the signature Sup Crab sauce, which added just the right amount of spice.

Not stopping there, we sampled several other dishes, evidence of which you'll find in my photos – each as delicious as the last.

Service was impeccable; attentive waiters ensured our food arrived piping hot. The restaurant's decor added to the overall pleasant experience, making it a spot I'd happily return to after a short stroll from the D train.

In conclusion, Sup Crab is a seafood haven I'd wholeheartedly recommend, whether you're a seasoned foodie or a curious newcomer craving a taste of the ocean's bounty.",1
2383,"Title: A Gem in the City: Giano Restaurant Review

I had the sheer pleasure of dining at Giano, a charming establishment steered by a delightful couple, which offered both delectable cuisine and a heartwarming ambiance. Last Thursday, amidst a birthday celebration with friends, I experienced firsthand the welcoming spirit of the place, accentuated by the owner's kindness when I arrived notably late, ensuring my meal was hastened to the table.

The menu featured Italian classics executed with finesse. The Tagliatelle alla Bolognese was a harmonious mix of flavors, perfectly balanced without an excess of tomato sauce. The Gnocchi Ai 4 Formaggi was a masterclass in texture—soft, smooth, and utterly indulgent. But it was the Lasagna Tradizionale that stole the show, earning the title of the best lasagna I've ever savored and the highlight of my meal.

Ending on a sweet note, their Tiramisu was an exquisite finale, marked by a restrained use of sugar that allowed the coffee essence to shine, paired with a base that was impeccably moist yet firm.

In conclusion, Giano is more than just a restaurant—it's a celebration of fine Italian cooking wrapped in an atmosphere of love and care. It's a must-visit for anyone with a penchant for high-quality Italian fare. The combination of exceptional food and a nurturing environment makes it an undeniable favorite.",1
19105,"Came to Rasa after hearing good reviews with a friend. We got there right at the opening time but they said they still weren't ready so we walked around for a short period of time. Came back 30-40 minutes later and were seated. The restaurant was well spaced and seemed fairly clean and well taken care of. After checking the menu, I decided on the Sarawak Laksa. They brought out the dish fairly quickly and it looked very good. Taste-wise, it was good but nothing exceptional. I was hoping for spicy but it was definitely on the more mild side. There were good portions for everything but honestly didn't feel anything remarkable about the dish. Pricing was on the upper side but I guess thats expected for someplace in the city. Overall, I feel like its good for people with more mellow tastes. I still prefer the places in flushing I've had for malaysian - more flavor and I usually leave fairly satisfied.",0
12134,"Toasties is a bit of a hole-in-the-wall sandwich store, but nevertheless one of my many coworkers' favorite lunch spots.The food is freshly made right before your eyes, and the oven-roasted turkey sandwiches are simply amazing. Much better than cold cuts - though they have those too! They have a menu that stretches from New York to the moon and back, so it can be a bit hard to choose what to eat - so I've just found and stuck with the turkey sandwiches like my coworkers do! I've also tried their grilled chicken with a hero roll, but it was lacking in taste and the chicken's juices left the bread quite soggy at the bottom. Once you find ""the one"" though, you're good to go! The price is reasonable depending on what you order, but I've found that the turkey BLT sandwiches on wheat for ~$8 are always deliciously satisfying and has its own distinct signature Toasties flavor.The food can be occasionally a bit inconsistent in the amount of meat given / size / etc, and the service is gruff, but I felt that it adds to the authenticity of the place. Not much of a sit-down store, so be ready to go in, order quickly (there's usually a crowd, but just tell your order to the guy who says ""Next!"" behind the counter in the back), and grab-n'-go. There's even a complimentary little wrapped pickle or two with every purchase!",0
1229,"Title: A Welcoming Haven for Early Morning Cravings

I recently found myself at this diner in the wee hours of the morning, searching for a place to sate an unexpected hunger. After discovering that nearby options on delivery apps and even a 24/7 McDonald's were closed, stumbling upon this establishment felt like striking gold.

The atmosphere was surprisingly welcoming for such a late hour, making it feel safe to dine in. My friend and I were seated immediately, an appreciated perk considering the sleepy time of day.

Opting for the spaghetti with meatballs set, which allowed a choice between soup or salad, and included an egg sandwich, my expectations were kept in check. The pasta dish was average—nothing to write home about—but it's a diner, not an Italian bistro. The chicken noodle soup, however, was marred by an overly salty taste that required some water to dilute.

A delightful surprise was the bread that accompanied the meal. It was exceptionally delicious and could easily be hailed as the best diner bread I've ever encountered.

Despite noticing that the floor cleanliness left a bit to be desired, the table itself was spotless, which is what truly mattered after a long, tiring day.

The diner also offered great value for money. Should I find myself in need of a late-night or early-morning dining option again, I would not hesitate to return here for another meal.",1
3541,"I'm not a fish-lover but I love this place!  I had the donburi rice bowl with fish added.  It was really delicious and filling.  I took a gamble with the fish  and I was stunned.  The artic charr was juicy with addictingly crispy skin and it was not fishy at all.  If this is what fish is supposed to taste like I would eat it every day.  I might reconsider this whole fish thing.  All the veggies in the rice were seasoned really well.  There were many different flavors that complimented each other - sour spicy kimchi, sweet mushrooms, etc.  The ceviche is to die for!  It was so refreshing.  Loved the textures and taste.  Everything here tastes so fresh.  The chipotle sauce and chips were the perfect touch.  Definitely coming back soon.---Update! Went back again for their lunch specials and it did not disappoint.  I ordered the local skate with mashed potatoes.  I devoured the whole plate and essentially licked it clean.  The fish was cooked to perfection, crispy on the outside and juicy tenderness on the inside.  Seasoned perfectly - I tasted salt and lemon.  The mashed potatoes complemented the fish very well.  The mashed potatoes were creamy and delicious on its own but definitely also worked as a palate cleanser for the more seasoned fish.  Of course I had to get the ceviche again. I believe there were different fish in there this time around but equally delectable.  Service is wonderful.  Water gets filled without asking.  Overall very friendly and welcoming.",0

My friend and I only got marinated short ribs and kimchi stew, but I wish we got only meat options because the meat here is sooooo delicious. They grill for you, so I'm grateful for the attentive service! The kimchi stew is good but the meat tho!!!!!!!!!!! We came here on a Sunday night around 630pm and got seated immediately. By the time we finished dinner, the place was pretty packed. I also asked if they have flavored soju and the answer is no ahah",0
14407,"Title: Flavorful Thai Cuisine in a Bustling Setting at Up Thai

My dining experience at Up Thai on a Wednesday evening was punctuated by both the hustle of the city and the warmth of excellent service. Despite a slight hiccup with the seating policy that requires complete parties, we were seated promptly after my friend's 7pm arrival—although it's worth noting that by 7:30pm the place was buzzing with activity.

The restaurant's interior is aesthetically pleasing, though the close proximity of tables can contribute to a higher noise level. Our taste buds were greeted by a fairly priced and flavorful chicken satay, served with four skewers and a side of indulgent, albeit slightly oily, garlic bread. While the chicken tended toward dryness, the robust peanut dipping sauce provided the necessary moisture.

We also savored the pad thai with tofu, a dish my friend wholeheartedly recommends, and I found myself particularly enamored with the panang curry with chicken. The curry's mild heat was well-balanced and didn't overwhelm the generous portions of chicken and vegetables.

Service at Up Thai deserves a special mention; the waitstaff's attention to detail and the on-point floor management reflect a commendable operating standard, even if it slightly diminishes the ""homey"" atmosphere.

Price-wise, Up Thai positions itself competitively within the NYC Thai scene. Given the delectable flavors and quality service, I believe it's a worthwhile indulgence. I'm looking forward to a return visit to explore more of their menu offerings.",1
10759,"Title: A Mix-Up on the Waitlist with a Speakeasy Save

My recent visit to the restaurant began with a bit of confusion at the host stand. Despite joining the Yelp waitlist and receiving a notification that my table was ready, I was told to expect another 20-30 minute delay upon arrival. The waitlist process was unclear, seemingly a prelude to another wait.

Fortunately, the restaurant offered us a spot in their new speakeasy on the third floor while we waited. The ambiance was so inviting that we decided to dine there instead. We indulged in the 'nacho belly' and 'spicy charred chicken' tapas, along with a bulgogi stone bowl - all of which were delicious. The chicken dish packed a potent punch of heat. An added bonus was the check-in offer of fruit-flavored soju shots, which the speakeasy graciously honored.

Overall, despite the initial waitlist confusion, the unexpected speakeasy experience and tasty menu offerings made for a satisfying evening.",1
16389,"So... I was supposed to be on a diet. But I was in the vicinity for a storytelling jam at @caveatnyc and Sweet Chick was in the vicinity... so we ended up here for dinner goddammit. Their dinner menu is the main draw for me, with chicken and waffles fused with different cuisines. For example, they have a Chinese version (general tso's fried chicken) and Italian (chicken parm). The chicken is flawless - extra crispy breading, ridiculously juicy. I can say this Nashville hot chicken was pretty damn authentic, having actually been to Nashville and having Prince's and Hattie B's.Nashville Fried Chicken & Milk Jam Waffle",0
14450,"Tucked away in a vast, echoing dining hall that reverberates with an upbeat British melody, this seafood haven is a delight for the senses. Though the seating arrangement may echo the unconventional style of the erstwhile John Dory, it hardly distracts from the culinary experience for a true seafood aficionado.

The feast began with a diverse selection of oysters, each boasting its unique briny essence, followed by a delicate mussels escabeche that balanced vinegar and sweetness to perfection. The standout of the meal, however, were the fish sticks - a simple dish executed with such finesse that it left a lasting impression.

Rounding out the meal was a comforting bowl of chowder. While the presentation unexpectedly lacked the whole clams featured on their Instagram, the flavor was uncompromised, delivering a rich and creamy taste that encapsulates the essence of the sea.

Overall, if your palate yearns for aquatic delights, this restaurant's fare is a siren call that is hard to resist, ensuring a dining experience that is both super delicious and authentic.",1
12180,"Title: Dumpling Delight in Chinatown

Review:

Had an incredible culinary experience with what I can only describe as the best dumplings I've ever had – the flavor is out of this world! The option to take a frozen bag home is a bonus. Make sure to try the fried dumplings with a drizzle of their chili oil sauce; your taste buds will thank you. The dry noodles with minced pork deserve a solid 5/5. Service is pretty standard for Chinatown, not the highlight but it's all about the food here. If you're nearby, it's a must-visit spot. Truly a dumpling haven worth stopping by!",1
2887,"Title: A Carnivore's Delight at Blossom - Chelsea's Vegan Gem

As a devout meat-eater, I was skeptical about dining at a vegan establishment, but Blossom, tucked away near the Chelsea Galleries, was a delightful surprise. This lunchtime jaunt, prompted by my vegetarian best friend's visit, proved to be a revelatory culinary experience.

The bilberry nectar, priced at $3, was the first pleasant shock. A robust glass of this thick, ice-free drink offered a perfect balance of sweetness, medicinal notes, and a hint of herbal complexity. Bilberry, a new discovery for me, seemed like a cousin to the blueberry with an intriguing twist. I would return just for another glass of this unique concoction.

The buffalo risotto croquettes were a steep $13 for an appetizer, but they justified their price tag. Three hefty croquettes arrived, each boasting a crispy shell and a spicy, creamy risotto heart that paid homage to buffalo wings while standing proudly on their own. The pairing with blue cheese dressing was a match made in heaven.

Rigatoni for $22 could have been an overreach, but not at Blossom. The dish was a symphony of flavors—porcini-cashew cream lending a light but robust base, flecks of pistachio gremolata adding crunch, and a side of caramelized onion & fennel jam crostini elevating the plate to new heights. The generous helping of broccoli rabe cut through the richness, providing a welcome bitterness.

Although we made a 12:30 PM reservation and the place wasn't packed, it was a prudent move. Blossom delivered an exquisite meal that made me forget the absence of meat. I wholeheartedly recommend it to vegans, vegetarians, and even skeptics like myself.",1
14721,"Title: A Pleasant Seafood Lunch at a Cozy Spot

I recently visited this restaurant for a Tuesday afternoon lunch and even as a non-seafood enthusiast, I was impressed. Opting for the shrimp tacos accompanied by chips and guacamole, both my mother and I enjoyed the flavorsome, fresh, and seemingly authentic dishes. A notable mention goes to the friendly staff and the charming decor that enhanced the dining experience. The service was commendably swift, adding to the desire to return and explore more of the menu.

While the menu and seating options are somewhat limited, the overall experience was positive enough to recommend a visit. So if you're in the vicinity and considering where to dine, this establishment is certainly worth the stop.",1
20750,Best plain slice in NYC! Can't be compared to other types of slices like Sicilian pies or anything. I'm rating this based on the plain triangle slice of pizza. Not too greasy. Just the right amount of sauce and cheese. Semolina crust just how ma fathaaaa taught me when I was just a banbinooo (Italian voice). They have a few locations but I love the one on 14th & 3rd. The counter guys yell at everyone when it's busy but they still smile and give me a wink. Maybe they think I'm pretty and I'm cool with that. Tip- the have the BEST garlic salt. It's not too strong. Not too thickly granulated. Slabber it on and you'll see.....,0

Copinette stands out as a testament to Manhattan's dining scene. During a quest for a lunch spot, my coworker and I were fortunate to discover this spacious gem. Its uncongested seating arrangement and pristine cleanliness immediately caught our attention, offering a comfortable experience with a thoughtful touch of privacy - a rare find in the city.

Not to be overshadowed by the ambiance, the food was praise-worthy. My choice of a cobb salad, a personal test for any kitchen, did not disappoint. It struck the right balance with its light dressing and flawlessly cooked chicken. The sandwiches we observed at other tables also seemed to promise a satisfying bite.

Practical amenities like a private room upstairs and a clean restroom further solidified Copinette as a four-star establishment in my book. Whether for a casual lunch or a potential dinner outing, it’s a place I’d gladly revisit.",1
16884,"Title: A Delightful Brunch Experience at [Restaurant Name]

My friends and I recently tried the bottomless brunch at [Restaurant Name] through the Pulsd App, and it was an absolute delight. Pro-tip: to maximize the experience, ensure your reservation is at 1:30 PM, which allows for a full 90 minutes of indulgence since brunch ends at 3 PM.

Upon arrival, we were promptly seated, and true to the restaurant's reputation, an endless stream of mimosas was already within reach. The ambiance was matched by impeccable service, particularly from our server, Lydia. She went above and beyond, ensuring our glasses were never empty and engaging us with warm conversation, adding a personal touch to our weekend treat.

Lydia's attentiveness and charm were the highlights of our visit. If you're planning a visit, requesting her as your server is a must. And at $29 through the Pulsd app, the value simply can't be beaten. Highly recommend [Restaurant Name] for an exceptional brunch experience – cheers to great food, endless mimosas, and stellar service!",1

17899,"Title: Mixed Emotions at a Hyped Spot

Upon entering the establishment, I encountered an ambiance that left me perplexed - it struck me as a peculiar hybrid between a bar and a restaurant, an identity crisis that could be better resolved for a clearer dining experience. The service staff, albeit friendly, seemed to operate at a snail's pace, which was surprising as we were the sole patrons partaking in a meal.

When it came to the meal itself, the peppercorn burger's arrival was delayed, a fact that stood out given the lack of other diners. While the bun was commendable for its structure and integrity, the burger patty was disappointingly parched, falling short of what the surrounding buzz had led me to expect. To compound matters, the pricing didn't quite align with the value received.

In summary, the experience was a juxtaposition of decent service with disproportionate wait times and food that doesn't live up to the hype, all at a cost that might have you questioning the worth.",1
11967,"Absolutely delicious food and great service!I found this spot after searching on yelp for vegan pho. My boyfriend and I came here for an early dinner and were the only ones in the restaurant. The restaurant was super cute and the bathrooms were clean. They had the front open for a nice breeze. I ordered the summer rolls with tofu and the veggie pho. My boyfriend ordered the spring rolls and beef pho. They have a great happy hour so we ordered draft beer as well.All of the food was fantastic! We barely needed any herbs or sauces because the broth was just that good. The summer rolls were filled with fresh veggies, which was unique compared to many other summer rolls I have had. I loved the citrus and mint water on the table too. So yummy and fresh to compliment the food. I love the shops and restaurants in this area so I will for sure be back!",0
16633,"Title: A Hidden Gem for Noodle Enthusiasts

Tucked away below street level, this cash-only nook may be modest in size, but it's grand in flavor. With just a couple of steps leading down into the eatery, you're greeted by a simple, hustle-and-bustle atmosphere that's perfect for a quick, satisfying meal. Seating is limited to two four-seater tables, so be prepared to take your meal to go during busier times.

The menu is concise, focusing on what they excel at – rice noodles and cheung fun. I opted for the curry fish ball rice rolls, which did not disappoint. When ordering, customize your dish with condiments like melted peanut butter, sweet sauce, sesame, or hot sauce, and specify the size and whether you’re dining in or taking out.

Watching the dedicated staff skillfully prepare the rice noodles across several ovens, you understand that the food is worth the wait. While there, don't miss out on the $1 soy milk, an absolute steal and the perfect complement to their savory dishes.

Patience is key in this bustling spot, but your taste buds will thank you. Definitely make time to visit and dive into their delectable offerings.",1
15481,"Title: Speedy Service and Mouthwatering Chicken at Local Eatery

I can't praise the staff at this restaurant enough, especially Russel, who is nothing short of a superhero. Thanks to a bit of a mix-up on both our ends, he swooped in and delivered a feast for my team of 20 in under 30 minutes! We were treated to succulent chicken fingers accompanied by an impressive assortment of sauces. Personally, I couldn't get enough of the buffalo and vampire sauces – they were so good I found myself scraping the container for every last drop.

The fries, both regular and Cajun, were a hit as well; they were perfectly seasoned with just the right amount of spice to make your taste buds dance. The chicken itself deserves a standing ovation – it had a beautiful crispy exterior that gave way to the most moist and tender interior. It's a mystery how Russel manages to create such perfection, but I'm not complaining.

I was so impressed that I returned the very next day to treat myself and my partner. While she indulged in the buffalo tenders, I couldn't resist trying the pretzel caramel/honey flavor, and let me tell you, it was nothing short of fantastic. If you're looking for delightful flavors and staff that go the extra mile, this is your spot.",1
10860,"Despite warnings of long lines from friends who endured a 35-minute wait for pizza, I seized the chance to visit this acclaimed spot before my flight, even if it meant a contrarian 8-minute subway ride. Serendipity was on my side, as I basked in a mere 5-minute wait for a divine, fresh-from-the-oven pepperoni square slice.

Priced at $5, cash is king here, though card payments incur a negligible 20-cent fee. The pizza itself? Utterly crispy, lavishly pepperoni-topped, each bite a crescendo of flavor, despite the oil-collecting pepperoni shape—a minor quibble.

This establishment has now skyrocketed to my favorite for thicker, crispier slices. A noteworthy culinary adventure, it is a must-visit for any pizza connoisseur.",1
11535,"Title: Charming Indian Gem with Welcoming Vibes

I stumbled upon a delightful neighborhood Indian restaurant recently and it turned out to be a stroke of luck. With its warm and incredibly friendly staff, the eatery boasts a cozy atmosphere that can accommodate around 10 tables – a hint to either book ahead or opt for a convenient takeaway, given the frequent sight of carryout orders.

For those who enjoy pairing their meal with a glass of wine, there's no liquor license, but you're welcome to bring your own, courtesy of a splendid wine shop just around the corner. I'm not sure about the corkage fee, though.

The highlight of my visit was the chicken tikka curry, priced at about $15. It was quite a generous serving, brimming with succulent chicken pieces. While I requested it very spicy, it leaned more towards a mild to medium heat, yet it was thoroughly satisfying.

I must give a special mention to the beautifully prepared tandoori roti and what is possibly the thickest mango lassi I've come across – both of which were nothing short of excellent. This place is a must-try for anyone craving a taste of authentic Indian cuisine.",1
17005,"Title: A Festive Filipino Feast at [Restaurant Name]

Our party of six ventured into [Restaurant Name] for a Saturday lunch, and despite a brief 20-minute wait beyond our reservation time, the experience that followed was well worth it. The culinary journey began as a humongous banana leaf was laid out before us, serving as our communal plate, and hand napkins were provided in anticipation of the hands-on dining adventure.

Opting for the basic package with an addition of aromatic garlic rice, we dove into an array of Filipino delights. Standouts included the crispy lumpia (spring rolls) and the savory longganisa (local sausage), both of which offered a burst of rich flavors. While the chicken adobo did not quite hit the mark for our tastes, it was a negligible hiccup in an otherwise splendid meal.

Packing leftovers was a welcomed option, adding value to the generous feast. The meal concluded with a chiller of a dessert, Halo-halo, a delightful blend of Ube ice cream, flan, jellies, and other exotic mix-ins that was immensely cold yet irresistibly scrumptious.

Service throughout our stay was impeccable; ensuring a memorable dining experience. For those seeking the essence of Filipino cuisine served with a side of fun, [Restaurant Name] is a must-visit.",1

The meal kicked off with an appetizing array of starters: crispy spring rolls, tantalizing spicy pig feet, and fried chicken wings that had our taste buds literally dancing. The burst of unfamiliar yet refreshing herbs was a true palate pleaser. Simply put, yum!

Props to Henry for steering us towards these impeccable choices—his recommendations truly made our dining experience remarkable.

And let's not overlook the ambiance. The interior took us by surprise with its thoughtful and engaging design, enhancing the dining experience greatly.

The fried dough pizza was a delightful surprise, both scrumptious and unique. The portion, comprising four generous slices, is perfect for sharing between two patrons.

12652,"I recently dined at a restaurant where I had an experience worth sharing. The service was commendable, with a wonderful waiter attending to our table, and the ambience struck a note of elegance with its modern flair that was quite excellent.

However, my meal had its ups and downs. The bouillabaisse had potential, but the mussels and lobster were tougher than desired, suggesting a mistiming in their addition to the dish. On the brighter side, the bread selection was delightful, with the mini baguettes being a notable highlight.

The lettuce salad paired with a slice of brie was a fresh touch, although the mustard dressing proved overpowering for my taste. Despite the culinary hiccups, the overall experience was pleasant, bolstered by the attentive service and chic surroundings.",1
17345,"Ordered on ritual for lunch and I feel like I wasted my money. What a mistake. The guy at the counter was super unfriendly and was chilling in the back with his phone. All of the pickup orders were in the fridge. Why would you put warm rice in the fridge? The bowl was constructed weirdly as the rice was placed above the kale. The rice was super gummy and not appetizing at all. I ended up picking out all of the rice. The fish was marinated well but there was barely any of it and not proportional to the bowl. Whoever made it was in a rush to cap it and crushed the fish. Also, many poke places offer crab salad and masago as free toppings - this place did not. Hard pass on this place. I was still hungry afterwards.",0
15517,"Title: ""A Second Chance Falls Flat at Local Taqueria""

I revisited this spot hoping for redemption after an initial letdown, especially with the underwhelming veggie tacos from my first visit. Joined by friends, we sampled a range of offerings, including Sofia's Secret guac, crispy wings, chicken flautas, burrata, and a steak burrito. Unfortunately, the experience was lackluster, with the menu items failing to impress. The wings were unexpectedly sweet, the acclaimed guac was disappointingly bland, and the flautas suffered from dryness. Surprisingly, the burrata emerged as the highlight, an odd standout for a taqueria.

Our dessert venture included horchata flan, cookie butter tres leches, and chocolate cheesecake. The flan shone with its delightful flavor, but the other desserts, though creatively conceived, missed the mark. The spicy mango sangria was a high note, vibrant and enjoyable. Despite this, the overall culinary experience was mediocre, and it's unlikely I'll return, even with tempting drinks on the menu.",1
17189,"Title: A Birthday Bash to Remember at a Swanky Spot

Last night's celebration of my son's birthday at this highly acclaimed restaurant was nothing short of spectacular. Despite it being a busy Friday night, the check-in staff's friendliness and efficiency had us seated within a reasonable 12-minute wait for our 9:30 reservation.

Our waiter, Bernie, was a true gem, providing excellent dish recommendations that lived up to their promise—each delectable course warranting its own shout-out for its perfection in taste and timely arrival.

I sampled one of the restaurant's signature drinks, whose balanced mix of ingredients hit just the right note—not overly strong or sweet. (Do check out the attached photo for a visual cue!)

The ambiance was spot on with a vibe that was both swanky and upbeat, complemented by great music, and an environment that boasted cleanliness and meticulous attention to detail.

To top off the night, the manager's personal touch, humor, and open invitation to return solidified our stellar dining experience. This place has certainly earned its stripes, and my family and I will definitely be returning.",1
12200,"Title: A Disappointing NYC Dining Experience

My family's recent visit to a well-known NYC eatery left us all disheartened. Despite New York City's reputation for exceptional culinary offerings, our experience was marred by subpar food, lackluster service, and exorbitant prices—a triple threat of disappointment.

Our bill soared to an astonishing $270 for three main dishes with a few sides, a steep cost for what we received. The grilled vegetables arrived at our table soggy, and the $20 shrimp cocktail was a miserly portion of just four shrimp. As for the steak, it was presented with a lack of flavor and was accompanied by a couple of unappealing shriveled mushrooms.

Even the bread, usually a reliable staple, was merely passable, and our dissatisfaction was such that we skipped dessert entirely, which is uncharacteristic for us. Though the building itself carries a certain charm and historical significance, it couldn't salvage the evening. Ultimately, this establishment fell drastically short of the high standards one expects from NYC dining, leaving us to rue the missed opportunity to explore better options the city has to offer.",1
11117,"My visit to this local spot for lunch was quite satisfying, especially considering its affordable pricing in a pricier neighborhood. I opted for the turkey club, which was exactly what you'd expect – a classic sandwich, nicely presented but not extraordinary. However, the highlight for us was their attention to dietary needs. My fiancé, who has celiac disease, thoroughly enjoyed their open Reuben sandwich, thanks to their thoughtful substitution of gluten-free bread. They also offer gluten-free buns for their burgers, which is a big plus. As a safe side option, he was served mashed potatoes instead of fries, which are typically off-limits due to cross-contamination in the fryer. It's great to see a restaurant that caters so well to gluten-sensitive patrons.",1

16635,"Title: Hit or Miss at Chic Japanese Eatery

My experience at this avant-garde Japanese restaurant was a mix of enchantment and disappointment. The allure of its concept and the Tokyo-esque ambiance set high expectations that, unfortunately, the food did not fully meet.

I opted for the seafood tempura lunch complemented by an order of uni. The meal promised an authentic Japanese culinary journey with a suite of dishes—from tempura and sashimi to chawanmushi and dessert.

The tempura, while encased in a delightful batter, fell short when it came down to the individual components. A glaring misstep was the dense Japanese sweet potato, which lacked the right texture. Even the scallop, although decent, did not match the creaminess I have savored in Japan or in other venues across New York City.

The chawanmushi was notably underwhelming, presenting a confusingly bland taste and an awkward texture that failed to resonate with my appreciation for traditional Japanese custard.

I was perplexed by the tempura dipping sauce's faint flavor, which seemed infused with natto but lacked the robustness I anticipated. In contrast, the rice was a success, and the sashimi, although fresh, was typical of what one might find at any competent sushi restaurant.

Despite the culinary setbacks, I must commend the impeccable service, which was a high point along with the immersive environment.

Concluding my lunch, which approached the $100 mark, I was left wanting in terms of the cuisine's sophistication and authenticity. While the restaurant nails its concept in creating an environment, it must refine its execution in the kitchen to truly transport its guests to the heart of Tokyo.",1
20623,"During my latest visit to NYC, I ticked another Union Square Hospitality Group venue off my list with a trip to Marta, nestled in the Redbury Hotel on 29th Street. A strategically planned 5 pm reservation meant I could enjoy the dinner offerings with the added benefit of happy hour prices until 6 pm.

The evening commenced with an eclectic trio of champagne glasses - Pierre Péters, Benoit Marguet, and Laherte Freres, each priced at $18 during happy hour and offering distinct tasting profiles. A Negroni followed, which, although beautifully presented, was notably bitter and heavy on the alcohol.

For the food, we sampled the Calamari alla Diavola, a $19 spicy grilled calamari with Asian influences. The portion, however, was on the smaller side, and it left me craving some rice as an accompaniment. The Stracciatella, reminiscent of stretched-out mozzarella, was a worthwhile happy hour selection at $13.5.

Rounding out the meal was a pizza adorned with prosciutto and soppressata to accommodate my lactose-intolerant companion. Despite its simple composition, the pizza was disappointingly the last to arrive, even after tables seated after us had been served.

In the end, the bill hovered around the $100 mark. My overall impression? The experience at Marta was satisfactory, though not extraordinary, with nothing particularly standing out to warrant a strong recommendation.",1
3382,"Tucked away in the bustling streets of New York lies a gem of a pizzeria that serves up slices that are criminally underrated. The aromatic blend of grease and cheese may linger with you a bit longer than anticipated, but rest assured, it's a small price to pay for a taste of authenticity. Each bite of their pizza captures the essence of what sets New York slices apart from the rest - the perfect balance of flavor and texture that leaves your palate recognizing the city's unique pizza prowess.

I started with the huevos rancheros, which were perfectly prepared (the attached picture doesn't do it justice). For the main course, the penne pasta was flavourful and cooked to perfection. To conclude the meal, I had a slice of 3 leches cake that was quite satisfying.

I've had eat better elsewhere.Pork cutlet(4.5/5)-amazing delicious. I could tell you this is number one menu in here. Fully cooked and crispy and inside pork was soft and tender. Beef cutlet(2/5)-little chewy and nothing special tasted. I would recommend you that please have pork cutlet.. definitely pork cutlet is better than this.Kitsune soba(4/5)-the broth was decent but noodle was over cooked.. noodle was too soft but hot broth was really good. If you order your cutlet with Gozen, you can get rice , soup, potato salad. But potato salad tasted like expired food... please be careful when you eat that.Service(4/5)-our table waitress was accommodating and kindly. They forgot my potato salads but she happy to served what I didn't got.",0
14423,"A fancy and modern Thai place in Chelsea. We ordered Tom kha (the best Tom kha I have ever had in NYC!), crab meat fried rice (good amount of crab in it) and Gra Prow Gai Kai Dow. Seriously.. the Thom Ka broth was divine! It was exactly what you would expect and want from a Thai coconut soup. I highly recommend and I will definitely come back soon. It can be little pricy compare to other Thai restaurant in NYC, but yeah.. good/delicious food deserve $$$.",0

13906,"Title: An Ode to Bite of Hong Kong

Bite of Hong Kong (BOHK) in Chinatown is more than just a restaurant to me; it's a trove of cherished memories of group gatherings. Its future may seem tenuous in these unprecedented times, but I am compelled to share my affection for this establishment.

Over the years, BOHK became synonymous with our monthly group dinners. The semi-private space at the back initially accommodated our table of twelve, enjoying the communal pass-around of delectable dishes atop a lazy susan – a gleeful spectacle. As our numbers swelled to 20 or 30, we would take over multiple tables, our laughter and celebrations merging with the restaurant's vibrant atmosphere.

The salted-egg eggplant turned into a signature request – a mere glance towards the servers was enough to have more of this crowd-pleaser on its way to our tables. The menu was a Cantonese delight, with beef chow fun and shrimp with mayonnaise being standout favorites.

Eventually, our growing group had to relocate, but my nostalgia for BOHK's crispy salted yolk eggplant and the warmth of those evenings lingers. Thank you, BOHK, for being the backdrop to so many wonderful moments. Here's to hoping you'll open your doors once more.",1
14746,Our go to chinese food delivery spot. They always deliver much quicker than the estimated delivery time which is awesome. We have yet to be disappointed from Noodle Fun... always spot on. Their wontons are so good and huge. Portions are definitely not skimpy at all.. and everything is reasonably priced. The lo mein is really good and doesn't feel / taste too greasy. I've gone to Noodle Fun to pick up an order as I live near by and it looked nice and clean in there. The woman working the registry at front was very nice. Will continue to order from here!!,0
18165,"Keeping in mind that this is Urbanspace and you will definitely be paying a premium for the convenience (for all the people who work in the area), I'm giving four stars for the food and service. This is the new fried chicken spot in Urbanspace where Delancey's was (see photo). I decided on the chicken tenders plate which includes a biscuit and choice of side: mac & cheese, fries, collard greens or coleslaw. My choice of side as you can see from the photo was fries. The cashier was very nice and my order came out less than a minute after I put the order in. Granted I went when there was no line but still appreciate the efficiency. Expect a line if you're coming during the lunch rush hours. Biscuit: buttery and flaky, exactly how it should taste Chicken Tenders: Crispy with a slight crunch on the outside and perfectly tender on the inside. Advertised as a fried chicken place, I had high expectations and they delivered. It's a deceiving amount of chicken from the photo, actually more than I thought when I first opened the box. Fries: Same great crisp on the outside as the tenders. From the looks of it, I thought they'd be mushier but they were great (normally a fan of thinner and crisper fries). If you're craving fried chicken, this is a great spot!Tip: Order ahead on the Ritual app to avoid the crazy lines in Urbanspace. You can pick up on the left side.",0
10178,"Title: Phobar - A Dash of Trendy with a Traditional Vietnamese Twist

Phobar is currently the talk of the town in NYC, boasting a trendy ambiance that is all the rage. Yet, the question remains: does it deliver on its promise of authentic Vietnamese cuisine? Unquestionably, the answer is a resounding yes.

While the restaurant has jumped on the 'Crazy Rich Asians' bandwagon, naming dishes after the hit movie—which comes across as somewhat distasteful to a purist—it seems to resonate well with their clientele. I decided to give their ""25 hour Crazy Rich Broth"" a try, while my companion, whose beauty is as striking as the décor, went for the Bun Bo Hue.

As someone with a discerning palate for Bun Bo Hue, I must admit I approached the dish with skepticism. Nevertheless, it did not disappoint. Although it could have been spicier to match the authentic taste I remember from childhood, the foundational flavors were spot on.

The ""Crazy Rich"" broth, while rich in flavor, fell short of the traditional depth I had hoped for. It was more of a flirtation with extravagance than a full embrace of it.

The restaurant itself is a feast for the eyes, complete with a beautifully appointed bar that encapsulates the essence of pho as nurturing comfort food. The meticulous attention to detail extends throughout the establishment. For example, the placemats charmingly teach guests how to say ""love"" in Vietnamese (""Yeu""), and the restrooms feature vibrant tropical neon ceilings—unique to each gender's facility.

Overall, Phobar is a delightful spot for anyone looking to indulge in Vietnamese flavors with a contemporary twist. Don't just take it from me—I'm neither crazy nor rich, just a guy who appreciates a good meal and a pleasant atmosphere.",1
11965,"I went here with my fiancé and another couple for Winter Restaurant Week 2020. Typical dinner restaurant week pre fix for $42 per person. We did not order any upcharges, but the waiter was (heavily) pushing for us to order the wine pairing pre fix for $80 per person. The food was served luke warm, which was fine. However, the soup would have been more enjoyable served hot (obviously). Their creme brûlée saved the meal. It was lavender flavored and a large portion size. I would return for another pre fix meal depending on the options offered.",0
12259,"Title: A Fiery Noodle Haven That Always Delivers

I'm absolutely enamored with this noodle sanctuary! Each visit is a confirmation of its culinary prowess, particularly with their spicy beef noodle soup and the zesty cumin lamb that burst with freshness and flavor. This time, I braved the crowd-favorite spicy cumin lamb. While undeniably tasty, it proved a tad overpowering for my palate and the lamb's natural game was more pronounced than I prefer. However, beef lovers might find it underwhelming compared to the beef options. That said, if your taste buds dance to the tune of cumin, the lamb dish could be your new obsession. The star of the show remains the hand-pulled noodles - an absolute must-try, twirling perfection in every bite. This noodle spot is a gastronomic gem that keeps on giving!",1
17788,"Upon a friend's recommendation, I ventured into the realm of Japanese BBQ at Gyu-Kaku, a hands-on grilling experience that I found delightfully engaging. Despite reading about subpar service, my personal encounter was outstanding, with our server being particularly helpful, guiding us through the restaurant's features and even proffering an invite code to the Gyu-Kaku app which netted us a scrumptious Spicy Tuna Volcano on the house.

Opting for a shared Meat Lovers lunch set due to moderate appetites, the highlight was undoubtedly the Bistro Hanger Steak – a perfect symphony of flavor and tenderness, especially when paired with the restaurant's spicy sauce. The staff's attentiveness to our grilling needs, consistently swapping out the grill, was commendable.

The Spicy Tuna Volcano deserves a special mention; fresh, devoid of fishiness, and pairing magnificently with the crispy fried rice, it was a revelation for someone typically averse to raw fish. Thanks to a savvy suggestion from our server, we doubled down on our app strategy, grabbing a gratis portion of Toro Beef, elevating our meal further.

Clocking out at an economical $20 including tips, the experience proved that app-savvy diners can indeed feast on a budget. Gyu-Kaku has left an indelible mark on my palate, and it's a sure bet that I'll be returning to accrue more points and indulge in their delectable offerings. Highly recommended, especially for newcomers eager to delve into the robust world of Japanese BBQ.",1
20738,"Title: A Delightful Lunch at Top Thai

I recently had the pleasure of dining at Top Thai, conveniently located near Washington Square. Despite its bustling atmosphere, my party was promptly seated and cordially greeted, setting the tone for a remarkable dining experience.

Opting to craft our meal, we indulged in shared appetizers, including succulent shrimp dumplings, crisp spring rolls, and perfectly grilled chicken satay complemented by an outstanding peanut sauce. We also chose to split a chicken green curry, which we ordered medium spicy and found it tantalizingly flavorful.

For a mere $10, one could enjoy a lunch sampler with soup, a spring roll or dumpling, and a main dish, although additional costs vary with protein choices. Regardless of budget, Top Thai caters to a variety of appetites with their generous portions.

The service was notably friendly and swift—a testament to the restaurant's efficiency amidst a full house. Top Thai's culinary finesse shone through each dish, making me wish for a branch in my own neighborhood. For anyone in search of an exceptional Thai meal, Top Thai is a must-try.",1

Highly recommend!",1
13808,"I'm giving Maison Pickle 5 stars based solely on their ambiance and Mac and Cheese. My friend and I are both Mac and Cheese fanatics. The Mac and Cheese here is one of his favorites, so I had to give it a try. The French toast combos caught my eye, but I was told they are enormous and recommended for sharing between at least 2 people. Since neither one of us wanted a food coma, we ordered a small Mac and Cheese and a Smoked Salmon Hash Brown to share.This turned out to be just the right amount of food. The Mac and Cheese was just as amazing as I imagined. The top was broiled to a crisp. Underneath lies a gooey blend of penne swimming in a cheesy sauce. Each bite yields a cheese pull like no other. I could taste sharp cheddar and mozzarella but I'm not sure what other cheeses they used. The Smoked Salmon Hash Brown was also delicious. It's garnished with a heap of dill, but the dill flavor isn't strong. I was surprised to see salmon roe included too. The hash brown is of a latke pizza. The outer edges were crispy but the center was a little too soggy for my liking due to the sour cream they usedThis restaurant is definitely more upscale than its sister restaurant Jacob's Pickles. Plush booths, string lights, and a staircase that wraps around the kitchen bar, add to the lounge atmosphere. Around 4pm, they dimmed the lights and brought candles to every table. Maison Pickle is a great spot for a fancy, yet affordable Southern brunch or dinner.",0

I recently celebrated a friend’s birthday at [Restaurant Name] and was blown away by their Prix Fixe Pre-Theater dinner, offered from 3-7:30PM at a reasonable $43. We savored every bite, starting with the sumptuous, buttery escargot. The French Onion Soup Burger, a unique twist on a classic, lived up to its award-winning reputation while the Boeuf Bourguignon with tender short ribs was a symphony of flavors.

But the cherry on top was the heartwarming birthday serenade and candle-lit dessert provided by the attentive staff, leaving a lasting impression. I’m already looking forward to my next visit for another round of their innovative cuisine!",1
16807,"Food: 3.5/5 Ambiance: 2/5Customer Service: 5/5The food was decent but did not blow us away. My friend and I had just gotten back from Taiwan and were craving Taiwanese food. The oyster omelette had a nice chewiness and the orange sauce was very similar to what we had in Taiwan. The $7 fries were a huge let down. They sprinkled it with the same rice seasoning you can get at any Asian grocery store and served it with what tasted exactly like Kewpie Japanese mayo. At least have one other condiment or squirt some sriracha in there and make it spicy mayo to make it more interesting. The danzai noodles were just okay. They came in a very strong shrimpy broth, so stay away if you don't like the smell of seafood/shrimp. The noodles themselves had a great flavor and texture to them but I wished there was more garlic in the dish. The restaurant itself was waaay too dark! We couldn't even read our menus! They definitely tried to go for the night club vibe with the dark ambiance and neon lights but we weren't that into it. The smell of the bathroom also kept wafting over even though we were two tables away. Customer service was excellent and the food came out at a reasonable time. Our waiter was also very honest about what he liked and disliked on the menu, which we all appreciated.",0
16415,"Title: A Delightful Brunch at Momofuku

I had the pleasure of brunching at Momofuku this past weekend and the experience was nothing short of fantastic. As a fan of David Chang's culinary prowess, my expectations were high and I was not disappointed.

The meal kicked off with a unique smoked trout dip that was salty and delightfully complex, perfectly complemented by the accompanying pork rinds. For my main dish, I indulged in a blueberry skillet pancake, which nailed the balance between fluffy and crispy.

My fiancé opted for the spicy pork sausage and rice cakes, a dish that packs a punch for those who relish a bit of heat. The rice cakes were particularly intriguing, with a chewy, dough-like texture.

Momofuku is a must-visit for an innovative and satisfying brunch experience.",1
18154,"Title: Casual Bites and Brews in the Heart of EV

My recent foray into the bustling East Village brought me to this sports-themed watering hole, where the promise of a quick bite and drinks did not disappoint. Starting the evening in the refreshing outdoors with a cold beer set a convivial tone.

As the night matured, we transitioned indoors where our server, David, greeted us with remarkable warmth and professionalism. We dove into a plate of buffalo chicken wings which, while satisfactory, didn't steal the show. The sausage appetizer, though a seemingly popular choice among patrons, landed on our table with a less than stellar impression – they were somewhat lackluster but vanished from our plates nonetheless.

While the menu prices were what you’d expect for the area, and the restrooms maintained a commendable level of cleanliness, the overall culinary experience was quintessentially 'bar food'—nothing to write home about, but it filled the void.

The ambiance of the place leaned heavily into its sports bar identity, creating a lively yet pleasantly bearable noise level. A big plus was the immediate seating upon arrival, a rarity in such a prime location.

In summary, if you find yourself in the East Village with a hankering for standard bar fare in a venue where service shines (thanks to the likes of David), this spot is worth a try—though I'm personally on the fence about a return visit.",1
1586,"It's a very very cute restaurant, and the ingredients are really fresh, but sadly the food is just mediocre. If you're into really healthy food with almost no seasoning, this is the place for you. However, if you want a delicious meal, maybe look elsewhere.",0

The potato coating, lightly toasted with the hearty purée and sauce was heart warming Fettuccine carbonara was a miss but it's Resturant week after all. I don't eat pork tho so I had to request it without the bacon which may have killed it ..This time the desserts really stole the show. Between the toasted meringue ice cream flavor and the passion fruit tart on the Resturant menu and the unique creative take on creme brûlée with pineapple ice cream ( this was fromThe seasonal dessert menu) it was quite a treat for the senses.",0
17517,"I've been here twice now and enjoyed it both times! The food is similar to Dig Inn and other fast, healthy bowl spots. I like how quick the servers are and also helpful.For my recent bowl I got half rice and half greens, the mushroom barley balls, and two of the side salads. My one complaint was that I didn't realize there were more sides because the hot ones are separated from the cold salads. I guess I could have paid better attention but it was crowded as well making it hard to see everything. Unfortunately the sauces ran out before I was checking out as I would have liked to try those too.The options for proteins are good but they do charge extra for seafood. I think the sides rotate seasonally so that is nice because then you don't get the same options over and over again. All in all the food tastes very fresh and flavorful.",0
11299,"Title: Mixed Feelings on the Monday Special

I returned to the restaurant eager to try their Monday special, offering four tacos with a choice of sangria or beer for $22. Unfortunately, my experience was a mixed bag. The al pastor taco disappointed with its overly large, fatty pork pieces and a lack of pineapple, while the baja fish taco suffered from blandness, unenhanced by its accompaniments.

However, it wasn’t all underwhelming—the chicken taco was quite satisfying, and the shrimp taco was the star, as usual, loaded with generous amounts of succulent shrimp. The sangria I chose as my beverage was delightful, well-balanced, and not overly sweet.

An added bonus was the check-in offer of churros, which were a sweet and delicious treat. I have to commend the service, which was both efficient and attentive. While some of the taco offerings were a letdown, the value of the deal still holds, especially considering the usual prices. In future visits, I'll be sure to zero in on the shrimp tacos. Overall, the experience offered enough positives to warrant a return, albeit with a more selective approach to the menu.",1

13217,"Title: High Hopes, But Missed the Mark at Local Pizzeria

After an enjoyable stroll around San Gennaro, a friend and I decided to finally try out the pizzeria I had bookmarked for years, spurred by our craving for a slice of pizza. With much anticipation, we ordered the original Margherita pie with mushrooms. Despite the high ratings on Yelp, the pizza fell short of the ""wow"" factor we were looking for. It lacked the distinctively delicious sauce akin to L&B's and didn't match the ingredient quality of Di Fara's. While the pie was decent, it didn't stand out amidst the myriad of exceptional pizzerias New York has to offer.

On a positive note, the pie was generously topped with mushrooms and had a satisfyingly crunchy crust. The service was commendable; our waitress was attentive, providing extra napkins proactively, and the server presented our pizza with a welcoming smile. While I'm content to have given this pizzeria a shot, I remain uncertain about returning. It's worth noting for future patrons that the establishment is cash-only.",1
17518,"I recently visited a charming mom and pop restaurant, tucked away on 10th street— a hidden gem overshadowed by the bustle of 9th avenue. Upon arrival, we were warmly greeted by PK, the proud owner, who informed us that the eatery has been serving customers for an impressive 37 years.

The exterior may resemble a bodega, but stepping inside reveals the key to their longevity: quality food, excellent service, and superb margaritas made with fresh lime juice. The option to customize your margarita, from a modest 8 oz to an indulgent 60 oz, was an unexpected delight, as was their willingness to craft a half-and-half blend of tequila and mezcal.

The brunch menu offered great value, with a generous serving of chilaquiles with moist, well-seasoned chicken and plenty of cheese for just $11. While tasty, it wasn't entirely authentic—the chips weren't homemade and hadn't been cooked in salsa. A suggestion for improvement would be to offer enhancements such as a fried egg or avocado for a small extra charge.

The steak and eggs, however, was an outright hit. A perfectly cooked and seasoned steak paired with three fried eggs, along with the traditional sides of rice and beans, truly showcased the kitchen's capabilities. To top off the experience, a complimentary slice of tres leches cake was a sweet finishing touch.

Eager to try more, I am already planning a return visit for the fruit margaritas and the dinner selection. This place is certainly worth revisiting.",1

18566,"Nestled in the heart of Soho, the Marshall-owned gem rightly earns its spot on top Zagat lists and personal recommendations alike. Our friends D & J introduced us to this culinary haven; indeed, a delightful revelation since its 1996 inception.

Upon arrival, the respect for our reservation was immediate, matched by the service's unwavering attentiveness. The harmonious partnership of Mr. Marshall's culinary prowess and Mrs. Marshall's wine expertise sets the stage for an unforgettable dining experience.

The greeting with tuna tartar amuse-bouche set a high standard, followed by an assortment of bread options, each a flavor encounter on its own. The cocktail prelude gave way to a tantalizing shared starter of tuna tartar, and a personalized baked stuffed clams dish redefined seafood indulgence with its chunky, savory filling.

The entrées showcased an expertise in seafood with a mushroom truffle crusted cod laying atop a decadent creamed spinach, a bouillabaisse brimming with fresh, oversized seafood in a subtle saffron broth, and perfectly baked scallops accompanying a crab risotto. Each dish was a testament to the chef's deft touch.

Desserts - a shared black walnut pie and an apple tart crowned with cinnamon ice cream - provided a sweet finale to the meal.

Nestled in the heart of Alphabet City, this quirky spot offers a menu of fancy fare that's surprisingly affordable, striking a balance between upscale dining and the casual eater's budget. The establishment, while not the most aesthetically traditional, has a unique allure that adds character and a sense of whimsy.

1719,"Decided to upgrade from the more pedestrian, collegiate go-go curry option and looked at curry places in the vicinity and landed upon Abiko curry and boy I'm glad I did.Being Indian myself, I've had a love/hate relationship with the Japanese version of ""curry"" or ""raisukare"". Not that I had any objections to how it tasted but more it seems some form of appropriation that didn't sit well with me for the longest time. A work trip to Tokyo few years ago revealed the real history of Japanese curry to me and I've been a fan since.What's great about this curry? Well the gravy is richer, has a more deeper texture and flavor to it, the richness brings me back. Perfect for a cold New York evening. I've paired the veggie/mushroom/shrimp (veggie has to be my favorite) curry with the pork/chicken marsh and the potato cutlets and they've all been great options. The chicken is likely my standard go to option although pork seems to be the default for curry elsewhere. Regarding spice level - the first time I tried I asked for a 3 and got a warning from the server that few people really enjoy the 3 and boy was he right. I'm an experienced eater of spicy foods and can vouch for the strength of the 2. For milder taste buds I'd def stick to the 1.What would make this a great 5 star option? Well, maybe some desert or more drink choices would be great - especially after your insides are burning from the delicious and spicy curries.

I recently visited Kahlo for Cinco de Mayo and left thoroughly impressed. The cucumber margarita set a vibrant tone for the evening—refreshing, crisp, and expertly crafted with fresh cucumber juice. The guacamole was delicious, but the elote stole the show with its decadent truffle aioli mingling delightfully with the sweet corn.

For the main event, I indulged in the empanada trio. The chorizo packed a flavorful punch, standing out as my favorite, closely followed by the equally tasty chicken tinga and mushroom varieties. Each empanada was a testament to perfect cooking, boasting a crispy shell with a well-seasoned interior.

Amidst our dining experience, a lively mariachi band added to the atmosphere, complementing the complimentary tequila shots that warmed our spirits. While the NYC premium prices and modest portion sizes were minor drawbacks, they couldn't overshadow the overall excellence of the meal.

Kahlo is a gem for anyone in search of sophisticated Mexican cuisine in the heart of the city.",1
3399,"During a recent Monday evening visit to Sugarfish, I found myself comfortably seated without the notoriously long wait. The wait staff, especially at the bar, was commendable for their friendly service.

I opted for the omakase 'lite', which, in retrospect, felt insufficient. Beginning with cold edamame, the meal progressed with a pleasant tuna appetizer in ponzu sauce—definitely a highlight worth trying on its own.

My sushi assortment consisted of albacore, salmon, yellowtail, and shrimp, served with noticeably warm rice that tended to cling to my fingers. The albacore, while tender, disintegrated a bit too easily, and the ponzu felt superfluous. The rest of the sushi ranged from good to just fine in quality.

A standout dish was the toro hand roll, boasting an ideal rice temperature, crisp seaweed, and deliciously buttery fish. However, the true star was the extra crab hand roll I ordered, with its sweet crab clearly overshadowing the lite menu's offerings.

While some dishes like the appetizer and hand rolls were exemplary, others didn't justify the price point or the usual long queues I've observed. Overall, the experience teeters between average and slightly above, landing at a 2.3 rating. The quality service and a few culinary wins nearly push it to a 3, yet the sense of value left much to be desired.",1

Last evening's opening night at this new local eatery proved they are on course to make quite the splash with their fresh fish offerings.

We couldn't resist the salmon tartare causa, a harmonious blend of raw salmon atop a savory bed of squid ink potatoes. Equally impressive were the scallop and octopus skewers that simply dissolved on the tongue.

Although the restaurant currently lacks a liquor license, their house-made sodas, especially the passion chili, did not disappoint and hinted at potential for future boozy versions.

The menu keeps it simple, yet be wary of the ""two servings"" dishes that'll have you paying double. Portion sizes are generous, so come hungry. We dove into a spicy seafood and chicken ramen that was hearty and satisfying. The chicken fell apart with tenderness, and the seafood was top-notch. Even with our best efforts, we couldn't clean our plate. A pro tip from observing fellow diners: after polishing off the main elements, ask for rice and seaweed to mix into the leftover sauce – it's a game-changer.",1
1938,"We only came here for the famous khachapuri - did not disappoint! I'd never had Georgian food before this so didn't know what to expect. They have a bunch of different types of khachapuri. We decided to keep it simple with egg and cheese boat. It's served hot and unscrambled - proper way is to ""scramble it"" to mix up the cheese and egg. The bread is soooo good. Now I'm thinking when I need to stop by again... will be back!",0
11771,"I recently visited a very decent Chinese restaurant in the heart of Chinatown with a friend. We opted for the stirred fried water spinach with garlic at $13.50, paired with the scrumptious pepper steak for $17.50, accompanying them with two bowls of rice. Service was swift, and the dishes arrived promptly.

The highlight was certainly the pepper steak—generous in sauce, it came packed with a variety of vegetables. The flavors were a perfect amalgamation of sweet and savory, and the meat was tender and juicy to the point where we devoured the entire dish. It's clear why this dish is a favorite.

Although the restaurant is famed for their Xiao Long Bao (XLB), which I have yet to try, the pepper steak might just tempt me into a repeat order on my next visit. Take note, this is a cash-only establishment, and while you might face waits over the weekend, the food justifies the patience.

The setup, with its large round tables, is ideal for accommodating bigger parties. All in all, a return visit is certainly on the cards, not just for the XLB, but perhaps for another helping of that delightful pepper steak.",1
10164,"I was driving down 2nd Avenue in Kips Bay, when i started craving their signature Baja Fish Burrito. Placed a quick order for pickup with Carmen. She was so sweet! I guess i expected someone not so bubbly because of the dreary weather. Waited about 15 minutes for my order, which was totally fine. I also opted for a Fruit Punch Jarritos. Ramen or phô are my dreary day go-tos, but something told me to try something different. So glad i did!!! This location is right on 2nd Avenue between East 6th and East 5th Streets. Minutes away from the 2nd Avenue stop on the F at Houston Street. I usually frequent the Brooklyn location in Greenpoint, but this will be my new preferred location. Great atmosphere, dimly lit , cool vibe and great staff! The food rocks too!!!",0
20501,"Title: A Letdown Close to the Hotel

After reading promising reviews, my dining experience at this nearby lunch spot was unfortunately disappointing. Despite the restaurant's bustling atmosphere and a menu of typical lunch specials, the dishes fell short of expectations. Both the hot and sour and egg drop soups were passable, but the main courses left much to be desired. The General Tso's chicken was overly breaded and cloyingly sweet—it reminded me of standard food court fare. The beef and vegetables suffered a similar fate, lacking the refinement I had hoped for, especially in a city like New York with its myriad of culinary delights.

In retrospect, I should've followed my initial instinct to explore further afield, perhaps in Chinatown or the West Village, for a more authentic and satisfying meal. That said, the service was efficient, a small consolation in light of the forgettable food. If you have the luxury of time and can hop on the subway, I'd recommend seeking out the numerous tastier options that NYC has to offer.",1
13574,"I recently had the pleasure of dining at this local Thai gem, which proved to be one of the best Thai meals I've had in ages. Using Yelp's convenient waitlist feature en route saved me some time, and I only had a brief 10-minute wait upon arrival. Although the entrance may deceive you into thinking the space is cramped, you'll find ample room towards the back. Casual attire is completely appropriate here, adding to the relaxed atmosphere. The culinary experience was outstanding, and I'm already planning my next visit. Admittedly, the ambiance was a bit noisy, but it didn’t detract from the enjoyment of the meal. Highly recommend for Thai cuisine aficionados!",1
14784,"I recently dined at this bustling spot on a Monday night, to my surprise, the place was buzzing with patrons. The star of my meal was the Minala Pizza, a delightful bianche variety laden with copious amounts of mozzarella, vibrant Amalfi red and yellow cherry tomatoes, fresh basil, a drizzle of olive oil, and crowned with creamy burrata. A cheese lover’s dream, though I'll note it might be a tad overwhelming for the faint of heart when it comes to dairy.

The cherry tomatoes added a burst of flavor that was quite enjoyable, however, they did render the center of the pizza somewhat soggy from their juices combined with the olive oil. This made it challenging to handle towards the middle, but this was a minor inconvenience in the grand scheme of things.

Overall, the experience was delectable. Despite the slight sogginess, the pizza was a hit and I'm already planning my next visit.",1
12696,We wanted to try a new ethnic food. This was great! A little independently owned place with super friendly help. We got the lunch special chicken gyro with green salad and pita bread. Oh so good! The chicken was tender and had a mild spice. Served with a yogurt sauce an spice sauce. For a sweet treat we got the baklava. It was dripping with honey and had a perfect balance of pistachio and flakey phylo.,0
16175,"Wow wow wow! I loved everything about my meal so much that I am still dreaming about a few dishes.  I highly recommend a visit here!We walked in as a group of 4 and waited about 20minutes for a table on Saturday, not bad! It's a small restaurant but it's cozy and I loved the ambiance. Everyone was also very friendly :)To start, we had the soon du bu, pyunche salad, mul hwe, and toro ssam bbap + uni. Everything was yummy but the shining star was the pyunche salad! The dish blew me away with its complex flavors and textures! I don't know if it's the jeju chimchurri or their spicy yang yum jang sauce but the dish is not like anything else I have ever had and I can't stop thinking about it! Haha! Great balance between the fresh amberjack and crunchy salad, simple but explosive flavors!Of course, it's a noodle spot so we also had the SO ramyun, truffle bibim myun, and wagyu ramyun to share. Korean inspired ramen? YES, please! All tasty and I would like to have them all again but the truffle bibim myun was something different. The noodles were cooked perfectly with a good bite and chew to it and who doesn't love a bowl of noodles with truffle? I know I dream about truffles! Again, great flavor profiles and textures married together so eloquently. Thumbs up JeJu Noodle Bar and compliments to the chef!!",0
1047,"I recently had a delightful dining experience at a unique restaurant that sits at the crossroads of a hot pot place and an udon noodle shop. The star of the meal was the large stone bowl of broth that arrived at the table, piping hot and rich with deep, well-rounded flavors. 

The interactive element of the meal came with a plate of fresh, raw ingredients and vegetables, as well as noodles, which I got to mix into the steaming broth myself, watching as they cooked gently in the savory liquid. Each bite was a testament to the freshness and quality of the produce used.

To start, the appetizers were impressive, particularly the beef tendons, which were tender and seasoned to perfection. A standout addition to the meal that I'd recommend.

In summary, if the fusion of hot pot and udon intrigues your palate, this is a must-visit. The broth is exceptional, the DIY aspect is fun, and the appetizers are a solid lead into a comforting, satisfying main course.",1
1896,"Title: A Slice Above the Rest in NYC

Review:

From the moment we stepped into City Acres Market in search of this somewhat hidden gem, we knew we were in for a treat. This was our first dining experience in New York, and it set an incredibly high bar. Just thinking about it makes us want to return, and it's only been a few days!

Navigating the market to find the restaurant was a bit tricky, as there wasn't a standalone storefront, but the journey was well worth it. Their current special - buy three slices, get one free - was an offer we couldn't refuse. Though it was just the two of us, we dove in and emerged with a delightful assortment: artichoke, crab, Staten Island, and margherita pizzas.

Every bite was a voyage through flavor town, but the artichoke slice was the star of the show with its creamy and savory profile. The crab slice was a delightful surprise, reminiscent of a comforting clam chowder. While the Staten Island and Margherita were enjoyable, they didn't quite shine like their counterparts.

A word to the wise: the artichoke slice is best savored fresh from the oven, where its taste is beyond compare. Don't wait – this is a must-try experience for any pizza aficionado in the Big Apple. Highly recommend!",1
15528,"Out with my vegan friends they all wanted to check this place out we had an rsvp before catching a show near by. Since we were drinking before coming here no drinks this time we stuck to water. We got the Chef tasting plate to share great tasting bruschetta & empanadas, good tofu & fig quinoa sushi ok & seaweed caviar not a favorite. Main dish I went with the Gnocchi dinner  I must say this was very good great tasting gnocchi nice sauce.  Also tried the Lasagna good as well so was the Rigatoni. The Seitan Scallopini  was very good as well great tasting wine lemon caper sauce along with the truffle mash potatoes & kale. Nice location, 2 floors .. service was good & prices were not bad for a vegan place I really enjoyed my dinner we all did, wouldn't mind coming back.",0
20703,"Service was extremely slow. I think I waited about 10-15 minutes prior to anyone coming to bring me water. I had to track down my waited a few times to get something I needed. It was also extremely hot in the restaurant. I was literally sweating. The drink was good. I liked the thai mule, it had great flavor. I had also gotten the Siamese Fried Rice, it was a bit greasy but had a sufficient amount of flavor. Overall I cannot say I would return but it was a good stop for a quick meal to catch up with an old friend.",0
17127,"Title: Mixed Feelings at Mel's Burger Bar - A Decent Find in UES

Last Saturday, around 7 pm, my wife, cousin, and I decided to give Mel's Burger Bar a try. We were pleasantly surprised to find it wasn't crowded, and we were seated immediately. Taking advantage of the beautiful weather in the Upper East Side, we chose to sit outside.

To start, we shared a spinach artichoke flatbread and garlic fries for the table. The flatbread was fairly average, earning a 3/5 from me – nothing particularly stood out about it. The garlic fries also scored a 3/5; they were well-cooked, but lacked the garlicky punch I was expecting, with the garlic seeming more like an afterthought sprinkled on top post-frying.

The highlight, however, was the Mel's Double Double burger. It was nothing short of exceptional. I ordered it medium, and it arrived cooked to perfection – a juicy 6/5 in my book. The sauce and the accompanying ingredients paired perfectly, elevating the entire meal.

In conclusion, while some of the side dishes at Mel's Burger Bar didn't quite hit the mark, the burger alone was worth the visit. I would rate the overall experience a solid 4/5, thanks chiefly to that stellar burger. If you find yourself in UES with a burger craving, Mel's is worth a stop. Just make sure you know what to order!",1
11904,"Title: Enjoyable Classic Dining Experience at Smith & Wollensky

Rating: ★★★½☆

My recent visit to Smith & Wollensky was largely enjoyable, meriting a solid 3.5 out of 5 stars. Although we had a brief 5-minute wait despite our reservation, it was within reasonable expectations. Once seated at a cozy corner table with a semi-private booth, the ambiance was set for a pleasant evening.

Unfortunately, the meal began on a sour note with bread that was disappointingly stale, casting a shadow on what is usually a promising start to a dining experience. However, we opted for the restaurant week menu paired with an exquisite bottle of Pinot Noir, which did not disappoint.

The appetizers – split pea soup and calamari – were satisfying, and the main course, a 10oz filet, was exceptional; its tenderness and flavor stood out notably. To end the meal, the bourbon pecan pie, accompanied by whipped cream, was particularly delightful and emerged as the highlight of the dessert offerings.

While the prices at Smith & Wollensky are on the steeper side, it's in line with what one would expect from a quintessential New York City steakhouse. In summary, it was a good experience with some minor misses but many hits, especially for those looking for that classic NYC steakhouse feel.",1
17366,We look this place up from previous reviews trying to get some great noodles in Chinatown. We were not disappointed. We were very happy after making the trip to this place to find out the food was awesome. The employees are very friendly and the food comes out quickly.,0
11789,"Homemade gnocchi was superb- soft, warm, and wholesome! It's an extra $5 to make the pizza gluten free. It's quite a large pie so definitely shareable!

13514,"(TL;DR:  3.5 stars for food, -.5 for being overpriced, -1 for having a very misleading/out of date Yelp page where most of the items are not on the menu anymore.  Felt a bit duped into going.)This is the exact same establishment as ""social drink and food"", in the Yotel on 4th floor.  (Not sure why they made two Yelp listings, so they can keep the higher rated one?)Came here for brunch.  Not great not bad, but pricey for what it is.  Food is nothing spectacular but also no negative surprises.  Portions are pretty decent.  I would say 3.5, but rounded down because it's a bit overpriced.  I went there because of interesting dishes I saw on Yelp but something like 70% of those were not on the menu so just FYI.Terrace is quiet and not crowded on a Sunday.  It's mostly shaded and cool on a hot summer day.  Minimal views though unless you like looking at a bunch of residential high rises (as opposed to skyline, as in you can't see the horizon just a bunch of buildings towering over the area).I guess eat here if you're staying at the hotel, or need to find an uncrowded last minute outdoor terrace for your event.  Otherwise there are some other food choices in a 10 min radius you'll probably end up happier with - just search on Yelp.",0
19817,"This is one of my family's favorite spots to dine at in NY. They have some of the best pizza and calamari in Manhattan. We always make time to stop here when we are in town. Their lobster ravioli is also a great option. We tried it tonight for the first time, it was a big hit!",0
19653,"Title: A Decade of Delectable Lobster at Luke's

I've been a fervent patron of Luke's Lobster since its inception in the East Village over ten years ago. Their commitment to perfectly cooked lobster has been unwavering— it's always just the right level of ""toothsome"" rather than overdone, a testament to their culinary finesse.

However, during my latest visit, I noticed that the chilled lobster meat was served a tad too cold for my taste. The temperature seemed a few degrees lower than ideal, which somewhat marred the otherwise delightful experience. This particularly affected the indulgent truffle butter, an exquisite but seasonal addition, causing it to solidify rather than melding with the warm meat. When it comes to truffle butter, akin to cheese, the flavors truly blossom when it's closer to room temperature.

Despite this slight hiccup, Luke's still holds a special place in my heart for their consistently top-notch lobster dishes.",1
20600,"Title: A Haven for Late-Night Comfort Food

I recently visited this gem for some late-night blintzes and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food. It's tough to find fault with a place that serves up top-notch pierogis and blintzes at 3 am. The dishes here are not just good for soaking up the night's indulgences; they're genuinely delicious at any hour, a testament to the kitchen's skill.

My only gripe was the service speed; there was a noticeable wait for both the food and the bill. However, considering the bustling crowd at that unholy hour, this lapse is understandable and didn't diminish the overall experience.

I wholeheartedly recommend this spot for anyone craving Eastern European delights and will definitely be back for more.",1
11615,"Title: A Korean Twist on Tapas That Delights

My boyfriend and I chose this restaurant for a date night, and it didn't disappoint. Presenting a creative spin on tapas, paired with sizzling hot rice bowls, this place is a culinary gem. On our waiter's advice, we each indulged in two tapas and a generous rice bowl— a perfect recommendation as it turned out to be super filling.

The food arrived swiftly, yet it was the flavors that struck us as truly spectacular. The rice cakes featured a uniquely gooey texture that, while initially unexpected, were surprisingly delightful. Though the popcorn chicken was tasty, it didn't quite stand out as much as the other dishes.

The real star of the evening were the rice bowls, served piping hot straight from the pan, locking in an array of deep flavors that kept us hooked until the very last bite. Our experience was phenomenal, and we are already planning our next visit. This eatery is undoubtedly worth a return— 100% guaranteed.",1
11622,"During a recent visit to a local pizzeria, I indulged in a tasting spree that included three unique pizza slices. The promotion – buy two slices, get one free – was an enticing offer that led me to understand the buzz around this place.

My first slice, the artichoke, was a generous gift from the staff, since it was our maiden tasting. This slice is best described as a creamy fettuccine alfredo experience, sans the pasta but with delightful artichoke slices toppling over. Richly seasoned, it's a dense eat that demands an empty stomach and an adventurous palate.

The crab pizza was my companion's choice and a pleasant surprise. Adorned with a medley of flavors, it struck a harmonious balance that even a seafood-on-pizza skeptic like me appreciated. It was well-executed with a robust taste.

However, the meat lovers' slice failed to make an impression. It fell flat amidst the symphony of flavors, offering little excitement or depth. While the other varieties dazzled, this one was forgettable.

Despite the meaty disappointment, I'm intrigued by the other 'PIES' on the menu, eager to explore more of what this pizzeria has to offer.",1
13650,"Solid 4 star 24/7 diner in midtown.  Menu is massive and runs the gamut of cuisine, from Greek to Mexican to Italian to American diner fare.  Everything is here.  The staff is efficient and friendly.  It's pricey but this is midtown NYC.  They do make a damn fine grilled cheese - get it with bacon and tomatoes.  Their Gyro platter is huge and tasty.  Enjoy!",0
16735,"Title: A Less Than Stellar Experience at ABC Kitchen's Sibling

I had high hopes for my 8:30 pm reservation at the sister restaurant of my favorite dining spot, ABC Kitchen. Unfortunately, it fell a bit short of my expectations on a long weekend Sunday.

Upon arrival, we were seated at a less-than-desirable table along the wall, facing a partition that obstructed views and seemed to be a popular spot for waiting staff to gather—yet this didn't translate to attentive service. Following an incident where the table next to us knocked over their wine, our waiter got distracted and it took us 15 minutes to successfully place our drink and food orders. Although the food arrived swiftly, service inconsistencies persisted; our second round of drinks arrived so late that they were comped.

The food itself was satisfactory; the portions were just right, leaving us quite full after four dishes. Although the baked ricotta came highly recommended and was enjoyable, the timing of the courses could be improved, as it was oddly followed by pizza, making for a repetitive cheese experience. Additionally, there was a noticeable delay in clearing empty dishes from our table.

Despite these setbacks, I see potential for a better experience and wouldn't mind returning, perhaps with a group for a more vibrant atmosphere.",1
14749,"Title: Pleasant Surprise at Chinatown Gem

After an absence since its name change, I revisited this restaurant and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the fare on offer. With an extensive array of appetizers and main courses, the highlights were undoubtedly the flavorsome pad see ew and the delightfully crispy chicken wings. The less impressive pad Thai, however, fell short with its peculiar taste profile. The Chang Thai beer served as a refreshing cap to a long workday, providing a much-needed respite.

On the downside, the service left much to be desired. Staff seemed inattentive, responding only when summoned, which detracted from the overall experience.

Despite this, the quality of the food has convinced me to give this spot another go when I find myself in Chinatown.",1
10887,"Title: Brunch at [Restaurant Name]: A Mixed Bag

I was eager to try out [Restaurant Name], and finally, a brunch date with friends provided the opportunity. Our anticipation was dampened by a rather restricted brunch menu, further narrowed by a shortage of beef—one of the scant five main dishes offered.

Heeding our waiter's advice, we ordered two starters to share among the four of us: the Peas 'N' Pigs and Lentil Soup, both of which were highlights. The crunchy chickpeas complemented the zesty chorizo perfectly, while the lentil soup was a cozy accompaniment to the chilly weather outside.

However, my entree, the Spicy Chicken, left me underwhelmed. Overwhelmed by gochujang sauce, the dish's balance tipped too far into the realm of the overly sauced. It was palatable, but not what I had hoped for.

Despite these brunch blues, the quality of the starters persuades me to give [Restaurant Name] another chance, this time for dinner. The limited brunch experience has whetted my appetite for what else they might have to offer during their evening service.",1
1780,"My recent dining experience at this dual-concept restaurant left me with mixed feelings. On a Wednesday evening, I encountered a unique layout: a quiet, typical restaurant ambiance on one side, contrasted with a lively, club-like atmosphere on the other, separated merely by a door. Opting for the quieter area to enjoy conversation, I was surprised by the slow service despite the sparse crowd, likely due to shared staff with the bustling section.

The culinary offerings were a hit and miss. The jerk chicken wings were a highlight, bursting with flavor and thoroughly enjoyable. Unfortunately, my grilled tilapia main course lacked seasoning within, leaving me somewhat underwhelmed, though still satisfied. My companions had mixed reviews; the chicken and rice passed muster, but the lobster Mac and cheese was a disappointment due to what seemed like imitation lobster. The restaurant did show flexibility by promptly substituting it with a shrimp variant, which was a plus.

A downside to note was the intrusive volume of music from the lively section. Each time the door swung open, it drowned out our conversation, which was quite disruptive. While the food and service were generally just average, the energetic side did pique my curiosity—it might be worth checking out on a different night. However, for a quiet dinner, I'd recommend considering other options.",1
19911,"Very cool setting, definitely made me feel like i was in London.Very tight spot at least the lower lever is, the second floor dinning is wey more comfortable.They are not very good with reservations to say the least, will make you wait at least half hour in their tint tiny bar area where the bartender never ever gets your order... pointless situation!!!But then when you order food you do forger about the wait and really start enjoying a great culinary experience.Do not miss the tuna tostadas (named differently), the scallop shell comes with tuna and uni, very delicious.The sashimi and sushi is not at all creative but by.

14298,"Title: A Bowl of Sheer Delight at Midnight!

I can't recommend the Kimchi Ramen enough – it was absolutely divine! The heat level was spot on; present but not overpowering, it perfectly harmonized with every element in the bowl. The dish was a thrill with its enoki mushrooms, nori, perfectly soft boiled egg, and generous chunks of tofu. Opting for ground chicken was a wise choice; it was evenly spread throughout, ensuring a flavorful bite every time. And a bonus – I got some extra pork belly from a friend, which took it to another level!

Visiting the restaurant at 11:30 pm on a Friday was surprisingly pleasant; no crowd to speak of, which made seating our group of eight a breeze. It was the perfect detour for our midday school outing. While I've heard of long waits usually, luck was on our side, and so was the ramen – simply outstanding.",1
15411,"Solid place to get hot pot when you're in East Village. *** You can make reservations for parties of 2! Just call to let them know you're fine with communal dining. For communal dining, you'd be sitting at a table usually meant for 6 people, but there would be a gap between you and the other partyHow dining works:You get to choose 2-3 different broth mixes (we got the pig bone and Chinese herbal), and there's also a long counter with different sauces you can put into your sauce dish.

Our favorites were the beef and lamb slices, Chinese yam (shan yao), udon, enoki mushrooms, chrysanthemum (tong hao), fish tofu, pork blood, and quail eggs.Service tends to lag, though. I had to actively flag down a waiter whenever we wanted additional food, and upon each refill they always missed 2-3 different items.

1303,"Title: A Shucking Good Happy Hour at [Restaurant's Name]

I recently visited [Restaurant's Name] during their well-timed happy hour and it’s safe to say that I was not disappointed. Specializing in seafood, the restaurant truly lives up to its name.

I indulged in their littleneck clams and bluepoint oysters at incredibly reasonable prices ($1 and $1.35 each, respectively). Both selections were exceptionally meaty, fresh, and devoid of any off-putting taste—a testament to their quality.

The New England clam chowder, priced at a modest $5.25, was a creamy delight that paired wonderfully with the provided crackers.

I also sampled the vodka oyster bartini for $9, which, while creative, felt a tad overpowering for my taste—those less inclined towards a strong vodka presence might consider skipping it.

The highlight without a doubt was the oysters. For happy hour pricing, they were a steal and should be your go-to choice.

Overall verdict: Hit up [Restaurant's Name] during happy hour for the oysters—you won’t regret it!",1
19490,"Title: Hit-and-Miss Experience During Restaurant Week

I ventured out to this hidden spot during restaurant week, and the journey was a mixed bag. First off, the restaurant’s location is a puzzle, tucked away so well that it could serve as a speakeasy's blueprint. Upon arrival at a prompt 6 PM, seating was immediate but it was the calm before the service drought.

The restaurant, far from bustling with a mere two other tables occupied, seemed almost abandoned when it came to service. It took an astonishing 15 minutes for a ghost-like waiter to materialize with menus and a greeting. We weren't alone in our invisibility; echoes of dissatisfaction about the elusive service bounced from another table.

After our drink orders were finally placed, another disappearing act ensued, with a 10-minute wait for the drinks followed by a 15-minute vanishing spell before we could order food. It appeared there was just a lone waiter for the whole establishment, an odd setup given the sparse patronage.

On a brighter note, the food was decent. The crab cake appetizer was the highlight, truly delightful, while the NY Sirloin steak for the main course was passable but nothing to write home about. The dessert, a Lava Cake, did little to sway the mixed feelings.

In essence, if not for the reasonably tasty food, this review would be far more scathing. The lack of service was conspicuous and took a toll on the overall experience. It's a reluctant 3 stars, with the food saving it from a dismal 1.",1
13029,Got the brisket sandwich and the broccoli salad! Enjoyed both very much! The staff was veery kind and let me sample the salad and Mac and cheese. The meat was tender and the bread was fluffy. Very decently priced! Check this place out if you're in NY!,0

There are other appetizers that you can choose from. The tofu vegetable soup was light and mild. The fried chive pancake was nicely crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.

1900,"Great lunch special! And they offered  it to us on a holiday when little sheep across the street refused. This place is all you can eat hot pot or skewers. There are also complimentary appetizors  but they are definitly  catered to a chinese palette; edamame and chicken feet. The skewer and hotpot  all you can eat is 26$ a person while the skewer all you cann eat is 20$. I saw people boiling their skewers in their hotpot bowl which i thought was weird. And i couldnt see any grills at the tables  but the skewers that we ordered a la carte was grilled and loaded with cumin flavor. The lunch special was a selection of soups for 6.99$ I got the spicy lamb and the seafood. It did not skimp on either selection. It almost felt like they put a little bit of everything into the soup; lotus, rice cake, cabbage, etc. The service was also very nice helpful. They stood guard at either ends of the Room and helped before we had to call for it. Will definitely come back for the skewers",0

Enjoying the meal outdoors on the terrace was an added treat, given the beautiful weather. Whether you're in the mood for brunch, lunch, or dinner, Aquagrill is a must-visit. And for those seeking culinary inspiration, take a peek at my photos from dinner. My advice? Don't just walk to Aquagrill – run! You won't regret it. Enjoy your meal!",1
17534,"Personally my favorite place to eat at when I am around the Chelsea Market area. Though not as nicely displayed as other Chelsea Market restaurants this place beats them in terms of service.Los Mariscos specialty is fish/seafood based Mexican fare. They offer tacos, ceviches and soups most of which you can get with fish, shrimp or spicey-shrimp. The quality of them all is impressive. The tortillas are great and the seafood is fresh. Personally I prefer the shrimp but I was surprised how well cooked and hot the fish tacos were. Haven't had the soups yet but have been thinking of trying those.What impresses me about Los Mariscos compared to the many other restaurants around Chelsea are the ""extra"" things you can get here. For example across the whole restaurant you can freely get chips to add to your meal. It's a great way to fill yourself up if your still not full. Along with the chips you can get some great house made hot sauces. Personally I really love the peanut based hot sauce they offer near the kitchen window since its not super hot and has a nice subtle flavor. These small things make the difference (at least for me) when deciding what restaurant to visit in such a competitive area.Describing this place as a ""hole in the wall"" is pretty accurate. Though technically ""in"" the Chelsea Market building you can't get to it from the internal walk-way. Instead you have to find Los Mariscos on the buildings outside.  Inside the area can feel like a cave in terms in lighting and it feels quite crowded. It never seems like there are that many seats... but I haven't had a major problem with having to sit down after ordering. There are plenty of ""standing"" tables and there are even places to eat at the window to the kitchen.I found this place originally by accident and was being a bit more adventurous when I went inside. What I found is now a personal favorite for the area. I highly recommend checking this place out for the atmosphere and quality.",0
17511,Great lunch special. The salmon teriyaki is good. The fried carrots are a nice surprise. The fried potatoes are very good. The miso ramen is okThe hot stone with spicy pork and kimchi was awesome. The sauce makes a big difference. Staff is friendly.,0
16955,"Another great found in Chinatown! Heard about this place from family that it has the best claypot rice. It was a late lunch around 3pm and surprisingly there were quite a few people there. Restaurant is rather small and tight but manageable.Rice noodle with fried shrimp: $3.75. yelpers seemed to rave about this appetizer and it certainly did not disappoint. I also used the special rice noodle sauce. Delicious!!Preserved meat rice casserole: $7.75! Perfect on a cold day. I did add some soy sauce to the rice because soy sauce over claypot rice always makes everything taste better!Congee with pork and preserved egg: $4.75! Another great price item. I got this to go for my boyfriend. It had lots of ingredients although a bit watery. Overall, the prices were very reasonable, service was quick and attentive, food was delicious. What more can I ask for?! Would definitely come back and try other dishes.PS: you can have the rice casserole to go but you do literally need to bring the claypot with you. Better to eat it fresh and toasty hot at the restaurant.",0

Review:

From the plethora of Omakase experiences tucked away in the vibrant streets of NYC to the distinguished Michelin-starred eateries that grace the global culinary scene, I've savored some of the most exquisite bites one could imagine. However, nothing quite compares to the revelatory adventure for the palate provided by this gem of a restaurant.

The mastery with which each nigiri was crafted could only be described as an exploration of previously undiscovered taste realms. The freshness of the seafood was unparalleled, an indication of both select sourcing and impeccable timing in serving. The UNI was particularly remarkable, dissolving effortlessly like the richest of butters, while the groundbreaking fish liver concoction had us ordering seconds without a moment's hesitation.

Chef Mark was a delight, infusing humor and a personal touch to an already exceptional dining experience. Andrea's assistance with the nigiri was seamless, ensuring that each piece was enjoyed to its fullest potential. As for the ambience, it strikes a perfect chord between hip and sophisticated, with decor that complements the dining experience and music that subtly enhances the mood.

If there's one omakase spot that is bound to rise to the top of any aficionado's list, it's this one. Should it be overlooked by the Michelin inspectors, I'd be forced to question their judgment. For an omakase that truly astonishes, look no further; your taste buds will thank you.",1
14801,This rating is solely for the HH drinks.This is the perfect place to start out when you want to be drinking all day without breaking your budget. It's so cheap! My friends and I (a group of four) ordered a pitcher of margarita and a pitcher of mojito. The drinks were actually pretty strong! There were around 8-10 glasses per pitcher so it made more sense to do the pitcher. We were all significantly buzzed and it was the perfect place to catch up with some old friends.,0
21136,"I recently dined at a bustling eatery in New York on an unassuming Tuesday night, and the experience was a delightful surprise. Despite its modest size, the restaurant was teeming with guests, hinting at its popularity.

My local friend, adept with the menu, took the liberty of ordering for us both. We indulged in a trio of delights: cold sesame noodles, savory soup dumplings, and a crisp scallion pancake, each dish moreish and well-executed. A standout was the customizable sauce, adding just the right amount of zing to our meal.

Although we eyed the fried rice at neighboring tables with a tinge of food envy, our appetites were satiated. What truly impressed me was the affordability of our feast - a rarity in a city known for its hefty price tags.

This hidden gem also teased us with the promise of delectable dim sum, spurring eagerness for a repeat visit. This restaurant is poised to become a personal New York staple, and I eagerly anticipate my next meal here.",1
13584,"I have come here a couple of times, the service and food doesn't disappoint. This place is over priced.  The service is great, the food is out quickly, on Saturday nights there's a dj, the noise level is extremely loud, the white napkins were even getting spun, some people stood up to dance and the servers joking them, the food melts in your mouth. A place to save for special occasion and when you can spare a few bucks. If you're coming to see salt bae he is not always at this location, but you will still get a show as the server cut & tease the food before putting it on your plate.",0
140,"Pretty decent sushi for a cheap price! Ordered 7 rolls for around $25 including tax. It's a small establishment with mostly counter style seating. We were there for a quick bite. For being a sort of fast food sushi joint, it wasn't bad at all. Everything tasted fresh and the ratio of rice to fish was perfect. Cash only when ordering in.",0
12883,"To celebrate our Valentine's Day early, my fiancé surprised me with Spoon and Table bar for dinner! As it was the evening of February 13, the restaurant was crowded with numerous couples and friends! Our server didn't even talk to us until about 25 minutes after sitting down. Nonetheless, the restaurant was busy and the staff members almost looked overworked. We ended up ordering the red snapper with sweet potato mash as well as the mussels! We didn't get our food until about half an hour after ordering. However, everything was worth the wait! The red snapper was very soft, although it was a tad too salty. Nevertheless, this minor issue was resolved by using the sweet potato to neutralize the saltiness! This complimentary pair was just large enough to feel like I was full, but not too large that I would feel the itis afterward. The mussels were also delicious as well! They were bathed in a mix of white wine and buttery sauce. However, it was a shame that some of the mussels were missing the meat and were only empty shells. Furthermore, when chewing on some of them, we bit into lots of sand. Although a fantastic indicator of the mussels being fresh, it would have been nice to eat some mussels without being interrupted by some pesky sand particles. The mussels were also paired with some crispy and flavorful fries and some garlic bread, which was hard, but eventually softened up when dipped in any sauce. Overall a lovely experience to have! I have heard of people coming here for brunch, so I would love to come back here and try their delicious brunch food. Judging from their dinner, I have high expectations of their brunch being delicious for when I come back again! Definitely a great place to come to if you are in the area!",0
2537,"Title: Cozy Spot with Delightful Bites, Patience Required

Upon visiting this quaint eatery, it's important to note that patience is indeed a virtue, as service can lag. However, the culinary rewards justify the wait. The compact nature of the venue, with its close quarters and small kitchen, does little to dampen the dining experience.

Seating ourselves, there was a noticeable delay before our order was taken. Despite this, the meal was a delightful journey through robust flavors. My choice, the chicken adoba, featured meat that fell off the bone with tenderness, even if bone fragments required some vigilant navigation.

My partner's sizzling pig ears were a crispy revelation, wonderfully presented on a cast iron skillet that kept the sizzle all the way to our table. Definitely a dish to remember and repeat.

A companion's rice platter, though solid in flavor—especially the pork belly portion—suffered slightly with a slightly overdone BBQ beef that paled in comparison to the succulent pork.

I would be remiss not to praise the garlic rice, a standout supporting actor that enhanced each main course with its aromatic and savory presence.

Unfortunately, the meal concluded without a prompt to explore dessert options, a minor yet notable oversight.

In summary, despite its slower pace and snug environment, this restaurant delivers a four-star experience based on the strength of its delectable offerings. A return visit is on the horizon, with the sizzling pig ears and that alluring garlic rice calling my name.",1
14346,"Title: A Hidden Gem for Bao Enthusiasts

If you're on the hunt for an unassuming spot with food that packs a punch, look no further. Nestled in the heart of the city lies a little-known eatery that has quickly become our go-to for mouth-watering baos.

During our visit, we indulged in the Chairman's bao and the classic chicken bao. Each bite of the Chairman's bao was an experience in itself, with pork so tender and abundant it was hard to believe. And at just about $5, this is a steal for the quality and flavors you're getting.

But let's talk about the chicken bao – it was nothing short of a revelation. The perfect blend of crispy and juicy, it had us hooked from the first bite. Overwhelmed by its deliciousness, we gave in to temptation and ordered the spicy chicken bao as well. It did not disappoint.

In short, this is the kind of place you'll hesitate to tell people about, for fear the secret will get out. For bao lovers and newcomers alike, this place is a must-visit. Forget the frills – here, it's all about the flavor.",1
12273,"Some of the best things I've ever eaten. Took the bf here for a special bday treat. I made reservations as soon as the date opened up. Also did the truffle supplement and wine pairing, both were very worth it. The food was amazing, I will definitely come back for another season.",0
17739,"A good place to grab pizza near Union Square. Regular slices are $3 with others being  a dollar or so more.

2964,"My sister is a huge fan of by CHLOE so it was obvious that I had to give it a chance. We came on a Saturday around 3pm to avoid the lunch rush. It was decently busy. I love how this spacious this location is.I got the guac burger while my sister got the spicy thai salad. We also got a side of sweet potato fries to share. My burger was absolutely delicious! The party is bean based but not mushy. I also tried my sister's salad which was very good as well.The prices are decent for where it's located. Also, major plus for the mushroom themed wallpaper in the restroom!",0
1868,Cash onlyStanding room onlyI ordered the artichoke pizza ($6) which was full of creamy creamy goodness and the artichokes are super soft. The slices are so big that they require two plates to hold them up.

11817,"So ok this review is a little late. It's 2020 but this visit to Ichiran happened last year. Right after watching NY Rangers at Madison Square Garden, my friend and I decided to grab a bite and we ended up at this ramen place. This is one of the traditional Japanese style eating places where you have your individual seat although you come in with your friend. My friend and I sat side by side but we can't really engage in a conversation due to the seating layout. It's like being in Japan. I had the complete first world ramen but I gave the sliced meat to my friend. I enjoyed the ramen, vegetable, and the broth. It was quite good, especially on a rainy night. My friend told me that she usually saw a long line at this place but due to the late hours, we got our individual table right away. It was worth a try.",0
15542,"Nestled right beside the High Line, this bustling Spanish market-style restaurant is a true gastronomic joyride. The atmosphere is an exhilarating plunge into the vibrant culture of a Spanish bazaar, buzzing with life and bursting with flavor. Standouts include the empanadas, which are a revelation – flaky on the outside, succulent on the inside – and the potatoes, which are nothing short of amazing. It’s not just a meal; it’s an experience that delights with every bite. Highly recommended for anyone looking to indulge in authentic Spanish fare amidst an irresistible setting.",1
13243,"Super nice vibe, extremely reasonable prices, and fresh sushi. The quality of the sushi, I would give 3.5/5 --but the price is more than reasonable. Went here with my boyfriend and his friend for dinner and was pleasantly surprised. They have a waitlist, which you can join through the Yelp site/app. I suggest you join this waitlist ASAP, as wait times can be easily over 1 hour during the evening time (our wait time was 90 minutes...and it's a true 90 minute wait).  Thankfully we scoped this place out online before, before making our visit and joined the waitlist. The cool thing about the waitlist is that it gives you an approximate time to arrive at the restaurant, so that you may be seated within an appropriate time (score!).We arrived a bit after our suggested time, and had to wait approximately 15 minutes to be seated. Service was extremely pleasant, and sushi kept flowing once ordered. They tend to serve as soon as plates are ready. This worked well for us, as we all shared our plates tapas style. The alcohol is super cheap, and the saki we tried was of good quality (smooth, and got the job done).  My boyfriend ordered the frozen beer, of which I tasted and thought it was ""meh"". The frozen part doesn't taste like anything (just air)...we wished it would've been frozen beer on top of the actual beer, as that would've been a cool delight. We had our fair share of sushi, alcohol, and appetizers. For the three of us, the total was just under $131. (This was reallyyy good for the amount that we ordered!!!).This place is good for a date or for meeting up with friends. We will definitely be back!",0
2931,"Title: A Delightful Surprise at Ivan Ramen

I recently had the pleasure of dining at Ivan Ramen, a name I recognized from Chef's Table, thanks to a work trip. Although not typically a ramen enthusiast due to my seafood allergy, I was pleasantly surprised by my experience. The Tofu Coney Island was a revelation: the tofu's flavor was unrivaled, with miso mushroom chili and mustard presenting a wonderfully unexpected combination. It was so delectable, I considered a second helping.

My entrée options were naturally limited, but the chicken paitan did not disappoint. Completing an entire bowl was a first for me, with the thin-cut noodles providing the perfect remedy for a chilly evening. The wine list was modest—understandable for a ramen spot—yet the Riesling paired nicely with my meal.

One small critique for Ivan Ramen: labeling a dish ""vegetarian"" while including seafood products can be misleading. However, I'm appreciative of being steered away from potential allergens.

Overall, Ivan Ramen defied my expectations and delivered a memorable dining experience.",1
16447,This place is not worth your time. They heckle you if you want to sit on the patio (2 appetizer minimum and 2 drink minimum) without a reservation and the appetizers are so expensive. They do not serve liquor and the beer selection is bad. Do not waste your time here.,0
12140,"Harlem Tavern is good, if you consider it a bar that happens to have food. It's more laid back, the service isn't always super fast and you're not going to get anything fancy. They food is consistent though and it's always a fun time. They have a good brunch special with and entree and a drink too.",0
2519,"**Xi'an - A Rap Review**

Yo, I hit up Xi'an and the vibe was strong,
A spot in NYC where tastes belong.
Flavors bold, the noodles long,
Each bite, a juicy, five-star song.

But, yo, listen up, here’s the catch,
No bathroom access - that's no match.
For a place with prices that latch,
Not offering comfort, that's the scratch.

The seats were tough, the A/C lacking,
Food served lukewarm, heat was slacking.
Yet memories of friends got me backing,
In Flushing's basement, nothing was lacking.

Now they're closed, I feel forlorn,
Lost in the city where taste was born.
Xi'an's still the dawn, its food can adorn,
Any table where spice is sworn.

So if you're hunting flavors that won,
And can overlook the missteps spun,
Hit up their other spots for fun,
Xi'an's legacy ain't undone.

**Outro Rap:**

I'm wrapping up with a flow so lean,
Xi'an's the king, no in-between.
From Reggaeton to salon sheen,
Eat at Xi'an, it's the cuisine dream.",1
19200,"Found this gem down the street from my hotel and ended up going two nights in a row! (And both my dad and I ended up ordering the exact same thing both nights even, haha!)Both nights we made reservations online- first night (Wednesday) was seamless and super easy; second night (Thursday) was PACKED!! So that being said I recommend going earlier in the week for faster service / better table, etc. Food was delicious both days but we just had to wait longer Thursday. I ordered Caprese salads and I thought it was fun that they clearly used different types of tomatoes each night (I'm attaching pics of both) - the first night the mozzarella was more gooey and smooth which I liked. We also ordered the special which included tuna tartar (w/ avo, yum!), branzino (fish) & brussel sprouts (realllllyy tasty sauce & topped with capers + pine nuts), & tiramisu (lovely presentation on a large slate)They make fresh mint tea and this is a must for after you enjoy your dinner!",0
10442,"Title: Mardi Gras Magic at a Favorite Spot

I recently revisited a favorite restaurant of mine, lured in by the promise of a Mardi Gras themed dinner. Having enjoyed past visits, my expectations were high, and I'm pleased to report they were met with vibrant, celebratory flair.

The atmosphere was enhanced by our well-positioned table overlooking the skating rink – a charming backdrop to the evening's revelry. Service was impeccable from start to finish, adding to the event's splendor.

The four-course menu kicked off with a tray of assorted appetizers, including oyster po'boy sliders, blackened shrimp, BBQ glazed pork belly, and boudin balls – each an explosion of authentic Southern flavor. Next, the crispy crab-stuffed shrimp maintained the momentum, wowing with its taste and presentation.

In the third course, shrimp and grits took center stage. While traditionally not a grits enthusiast, I found the shrimp faultless, and the accompaniment of braised collard greens certainly held its own.

Dessert was a tough choice but the pecan bread pudding with Bailey's ice cream triumphed. It was nothing short of divine, ending the meal on a high note.

True to the theme, each guest was gifted a mask and beads, a spirited touch that brought smiles all around. The music, while not entirely on-theme, was pleasant and did not detract from the night's ambiance.

In summary, the restaurant delivered a delightful Mardi Gras experience with culinary excellence, making for a relaxed and thoroughly enjoyable evening.",1
12549,"I've been twice with a total of four other people. We all agree: B&B is one damned fine steakhouse! The design and concept is really cool. The layout is also quite nice, as it lends itself easily to private and semi-private group dining options. The service is always good, with some servers being downright great. Between us all, we've tried four different cocktails and two bottles of wine. All quite good, some stellar.Portion sizes (mains, sides, apps, and all pours) are very generous, helping them edge out some competitors due to offering more bang for your buck, and - in many cases - better quality and flavor profiles.Service is never rushed. Fatware, glassware, and linens all on point. Protein temps are always spot on, from three different cuts of steaks to pork + chicharron to duck. And those smoked cheddar grits....*drool*Most importantly, every single last type of person I've ever seen while dining has been given the same exemplary service and respectful treatment. I'm someone who is hypersensitive to such things, and I have never clocked one ounce of judgment or stigma in the form of poor service coming from the staff to a customer. This is important, as there are many ""nicer"" establishments throughout this city who consistently make certain demographics feel less than welcome.B&B, however, is offering quality, relaxing, welcoming and safe dining, putting them solidly in my top three nyc steakhouse favorites. If you're looking for a great night out, treat yourself to a memorable evening here.",0
15110,"Upon approaching Ichiran, one might mistake the queue for your average busy restaurant line, but it quickly becomes apparent that this is a queue with its own queue - a testament to its popularity and a necessary adaptation to avoid blocking a neighboring parking lot. The patience required is rewarded, and for more efficient seating, it's advisable to visit in a small group or embrace the possibility of dining solo.

Inside, Ichiran caters to the introverted diner with an innovative dining experience. An electronic board displays seat availability, leading you to private study carrel-like booths. The intimacy of the setup is enhanced by a bamboo mat that hides the serving area, offering a unique, near-solitary dining ambiance.

The star of the show is their Tonkotsu ramen, priced at $18.90. Served in a rectangular bowl topped with a heavy lid to lock in the flavor, the broth and custom-ordered noodles (recommend firmer than usual) justify the hype. For those craving a bit more, the extras plate at an additional $5 adds substantial value with extra meat and scallions.

Service is efficient, perhaps too much so, as the readiness to take orders can be a bit premature for newcomers still acquainting themselves with the ordering process. Nonetheless, attentiveness is assured with just the press of a button.

Ichiran delivers an unparalleled experience for ramen enthusiasts seeking solitude or simply looking to savor their meal in peace. The balance of flavor and unique dining format makes this spot a destination I'd eagerly revisit.",1
12594,"Title: Delicious Fare at Balthazar, Service Leaves Room for Improvement

Balthazar stands out as a noteworthy French bistro, a must-visit for those with a penchant for classic Parisian fare. The culinary experience does not fall short of expectations—the dessert menu alone is a compelling reason for multiple visits, with standouts like the mille feuille and banana crème proving to be exceptional indulgences.

The bistro's ambiance strikes a charming balance, offering a cool, relaxed setting with an aged interior, evoking an American take on a Parisian bistro scene, which works rather well until it doesn’t.

While the bistro is quite accommodating for group dining, the service, particularly when it comes to closing out, could use some refinements. A lengthy and frustrating wait to secure the bill, followed by a protracted process to finalize payment, tarnished an otherwise delightful dining experience.

If this were an isolated incident, it could be overlooked, but until the service can match the quality of the food, I find myself compelled to offer a restrained rating of 3 out of 5.",1
11580,"I recently visited a local eatery with high hopes for a comforting bowl of ramen. The Shio Black tonkotsu ramen did not disappoint with its rich broth and satisfying hit of umami. Unfortunately, the same praise can't be extended to the spicy tonkotsu or the miso ramen, which fell short of expectations. The inconsistency in the preparation of the ajitama, the ramen egg, was quite evident with one being a luscious deep orange and the other an unappealing neon yellow. On a brighter note, the Char siu don was a delight with its fluffy rice and tender, flavor-packed pork.

However, the dining experience was marred by the unsettling lack of cleanliness throughout the establishment. The floors and wall edges were coated with a noticeable layer of grime, and the state of the bathroom—with its potent musty odor and visible neglect—suggested an alarming disregard for hygiene. The decrepit sushi bar also contributed to the uncomfortable atmosphere with its dingy and rusty appearance.

Regrettably, despite the culinary hits, the pervasive uncleanliness of the restaurant overshadows what could have been a pleasant dining experience.",1
20231,"Upon visiting the restaurant, we opted for a classic pizza, half pepperoni and half cheese, and anticipated a gratifying experience. Unfortunately, the presentation fell short of expectations with the pepperoni scattered unevenly across its designated half. This lack of attention to detail gave the impression that the pizza did not justify its $23 price tag. Additionally, the crust was charred beyond the desirable golden-brown, detracting from the overall enjoyment. Despite these missteps, the remainder of the pizza was quite tasty. However, there's room for improvement in preparation and presentation to enhance the dining experience.",1
21023,"Title: A Slice That Surpasses Expectations

I recently discovered a pizzeria that has arguably served me one of the best slices of pizza I've ever savored. As someone who typically steers clear of pepperoni pizza, the experience was nothing short of a revelation. The wait time was a reasonable 20 to 30 minutes, which was almost welcome considering my already full stomach from prior meals.

The service was swift once inside, unless you were behind a large order. The pizza itself was a triumph—hot, fresh, with a crust that struck the perfect balance between crispness and tenderness, thankfully devoid of any chewy cheese mishap. The sauce was subtly sweet yet richly savory, and the pepperoni was delightfully flavorful, each a tiny reservoir of spicy oil.

This establishment masterfully dispels any qualms about queueing; a slice (or two) is well worth the wait. I eagerly anticipate my next visit. Highly recommended!",1
2728,"Title: A Flavorful Find with Perfectly Placed Pork Belly

I recently indulged in a delightful dining experience where the $5 pork belly appetizer truly stole my heart. It was part of their Kushiyaki skewer selection and left an indelible mark on my palate - a must-try for any pork aficionado. Following that, I dived into the Tan Tan Men ramen, which was incredibly satisfying. While I personally wouldn't mind a bit more heat, the milder spice level is certainly a crowd-pleaser.

The restaurant's proximity to Bibble and Sip is a winning bonus, making for an ideal foodie excursion. I'm already planning a return visit with the hot skillet pork belly and Sutamina Ramen in my sights. Highly recommend a visit for those in search of scrumptious flavors!",1

Finding it was a breeze with its conspicuous signage leading us straight to an elevator and into what can only be described as a little slice of Korea. Spacious and welcoming, it was an inviting scene despite still being full from lunch.

We couldn't resist the allure of their menu— and we weren't disappointed. The meat was tender and brimming with flavor, a testament to the kitchen's prowess. The friendly staff added to the experience, taking the lead in grilling our selections to perfection.

The accompanying egg custard was a highlight, while the soup provided that comforting hug you seek from a hearty dish. If only there had been a wider array of sides to complement the mains, it would have been perfect. Nonetheless, this eatery has earned its place on my list of late-night must-visits.",1

After endlessly scrolling through alluring Instagram snapshots, my curiosity led me to this gem of a restaurant.

Imagine a succulent meatball encased in a cozy bread pocket - it was a hearty embrace for my taste buds.

Both dishes arrived piping hot, brimming with flavor. The staff exuded warmth and friendliness, although the service did waltz to a slower rhythm. If time is not a luxury, you might want to visit when you can savor the experience without haste.

The verdict? The food soared beyond expectations. I'm already craving my next visit to explore their more daring Trapizzini varieties. A return trip is on the horizon for another round of Italian delight.",1
15207,"886 was one of those restaurants where I enjoyed my dining experience while I was there, but in hindsight was not at all extraordinary and rather lackluster.Came here at 1 pm for lunch with friends, and we found out the restaurant also offered a brunch menu along with its usual fare. Four of us decided to split 3 dishes, and we sampled another friend's youtiao (fried dough) and soy milk.Dan bing Taiwanese Sausage - this is only on their brunch menu. It's kinda like the Taiwanese version of a breakfast burrito. Dough and eggs combine to form the wrap, and it's lined with sausage then topped with a sweet Hoisin sauce and scallions. Hakka Stir Fry - this is the one I was most disappointed with. For $13, we got a pretty tiny bowl filled with stir-fried dried tofu, pork, and vegetables. The taste was alright, but not at all compensating for the amount of food we had. Hsinchu Mifen - This one at least came in a plate rather than a tiny bowl. Mifen is super thin vermicelli, and it came topped with mushrooms, meat, and other vegetables. There definitely was way more noodles than anything else. Service here wasn't spectacular. We were a party of 6 but only 5 showed up, but the waitress still charged us the 20% mandatory tip. After we paid the bill, we didn't even sit for more than 2 minutes when the waitress nudged us to leave because they wanted to get this table ready for another party.",0

My choice of the evening's fare was impeccable: a selection of oysters followed by the ahi tuna soba noodle salad. The seafood was impressively fresh, elevating the flavors to a level of satisfaction only true freshness can achieve.

We arrived before our 9 pm reservation and decided to start with drinks at the bar. While the service was slow, and it took 24 minutes for our drinks to arrive, we were initially patient, enjoying the live band.

The ambiance was lively and enjoyable. Our appetizers, a selection of pork belly and beef empanadas, were delightfully tasty, although they arrived much later than expected. The quality of the food was a high point of the night.

However, service faltered considerably when it came to our main course. We both ordered skirt steaks with white rice and black beans. Unfortunately, my husband's meal was served a significant 28 minutes after mine, which forced us to eat separately. This lapse in timing and the lack of attention from our waitress throughout the evening significantly dampened our experience.

After expressing our concerns, the manager commendably comped our meal, which was a considerate gesture but could not entirely make up for the frustration of the evening. While the food was excellent and the atmosphere was vibrant, the service was sorely lacking. It's essential for the restaurant to address these issues to ensure diners can fully enjoy their experience.",1
16123,"This place is now in my Top 3 ramen spots in the city. Highly recommend the Zurutto Kuro or Deluxe (basically the same taste but more meat). I love the black garlic oil in it and find their chashu grilled perfectly. The restaurant actually smells heavenly with the aroma of grilled chashu. I also get a side of spicy chili oil on the side for that extra kick. I really am amazed how their chicken broth is so delicious, balanced with everything and that perfect noodles! The first time I went, it was onion overload so last Saturday, I asked for less onions and it was perfect.The space is huge, walking distance from the 1 train at 72nd, serve alcohol, and have attentive and polite staff. What's not to love? :)",0
14689,"I was in the mood for tacos so me and a coworker came here yesterday to check it out. I like the whole Japanese Mexican fusion concept. We both ordered the bento box which comes with 2 tacos, 1 side and salad, there were also a few chips thrown in. The price is pretty standard, $11 each. I ordered the shrimp chipotle hard taco, tofu soft taco, with my side being the slaw. My shrimp taco was delicious. The tofu taco however didn't have much flavor and the tortilla fell apart. The slaw was very tasty as well. My friend ordered the short rib taco, the chicken taco, and his side was rice and beans. He said it was good but I don't think it was enough food for him lolI would definitely try it again but after I try all the other yummy looking places that Urbanspace Vanderbilt has to choose from.",0
2098,"Title: Ichiran Ramen NYC: Authentic but Overpriced

I recently lunched at Ichiran Ramen's NYC location, which prides itself on delivering an authentic Japanese dining experience, complete with privacy partitions and a unique ordering system reminiscent of its roots in Japan. In terms of flavors and preparation, the standard ramen I ordered met expectations, offering a delightfully cooked dish with a balanced taste and medium spice level, garlic included. 

However, the price was a hard pill to swallow. At $18.80 for a basic bowl – which, mind you, includes a service tip – the cost was more than double what one would pay in Japan. The bowl itself was quite minimalist: a mere two slices of chashu and a sprinkle of green onions. Anything extra, such as nitamago or kikurage, incurred additional charges, potentially pushing the price up by another $5.

When it comes to value for money, Ichiran's offerings pale in comparison to other local ramen joints. For a more reasonable price, Tonchin's $17 tonkotsu comes with a more generous array of toppings included, and for a slightly cheaper option, Shinshi's miso ramen is a steal at $14.

Given the competitive ramen scene in NYC, it's unlikely I'll be revisiting Ichiran anytime soon. The experience, though culturally immersive, simply doesn't justify the steep prices when there are more complete and economical options readily available.",1

A visit here isn't complete without sampling the seasonal pasta, a testament to their commitment to freshness and craft with their handmade noodles. And leaving without digging into their signature tie dye pizza should be a culinary crime—it's an essential experience. Don’t miss out on these must-try dishes!",1
13111,"Solid choice to get some quality meat for lunch at Grand Central Station! It's not a 5 star kind of place, it's a counter in a food court downstairs but the food was quality and served quickly. Good luck finding a place to sit down and eat though",0
12692,"Came here for the star factor! Upon entry, we decided it's trendy and hip with its rough plaster exposed concrete wall on one side and reclaimed wood on the other it's bigger than it looks with a second level. We ordered crispy tofu which was tasty but found the hard outer crust on the tofu way too thick and hard, the side of caramelized kimchi was tasty. We also ordered the barn special chicken boa, which I highly recommend! Soft squishy white roll stuffed with fried chicken and shredded cabbage! We also ordered a spicy pork stone bowl which is sizzling hot, is a mixture of whole grain rice, veggies and spicy pork (not that spicy), a bowl of hot soup and your choice of truffle fries, which we got or your choice of salad. The plates are perfect for sharing which is a great way to enjoy the variety of dishes here and avg price is about $15 per plate.

13520,"Title: A Bustling Friday Feast at Burger Haven

I stopped by this vibrant eatery on a Friday evening around 7:30 PM and was pleasantly surprised to be seated immediately, albeit in the livelier back section near the bar. The atmosphere was boisterous, setting the scene for a fun night out.

Service was a highlight; our waitress was nothing short of attentive, swiftly taking our order with a smile. The menu boasted a plethora of burger choices, each more enticing than the last—decisions, decisions!

We indulged in fried pickles, which, despite being a bit on the greasy side, hit the spot perfectly. The sweet potato fries were a standout, especially when dipped into the accompanying BBQ sauce.

The main event, the Cheeseburger Baby, was a classic ensemble of fresh lettuce, tomato, pickles, onions, and cheese, all nestled within a soft potato bun. At $9.75, it was a steal considering the quality and taste.

To wash it all down, the Most Unusual Lemonade packed a punch with its lemonade vodka mint concoction—a refreshing twist on a classic drink.

Satisfaction was an understatement by the meal's end, and the discovery of their $30 bottomless brunch sealed the deal for future visits. This place is a must-try for burger aficionados and brunch enthusiasts alike!",1
1923,"My favorite Cap location by far! I always come in hoping that Dan and Johnny are behind the bar because they are legitimately the best bartenders-- so knowledgeable and funny, I never order anything I just let them make me whatever they want to and always knocks it out of the park! Also, do not leave without ordering the lamb chop appetizer. Seriously. Do not leave without eating them. **For those of you that love blue cheese stuffed olives in your dirty martini they have gorgeous gigantic ones here**",0

I recently ventured into the world of real ramen with a delivery order from this spot, and it did not disappoint. The delivery was swift, arriving earlier than anticipated, and the food was both hot and correctly fulfilled. The Nippori Ramen caught my eye with its unique blend of coconut milk, tender dark meat chicken, perfectly cooked noodles, and a notably amusing-looking egg that was a delightful surprise taste-wise. The dish was bursting with flavor and the cilantro added a fresh touch. Pricing is fair for the area, and given the quality and taste, I find it absolutely worth it. This spot has earned a repeat customer eager to explore more of their menu.",1
2843,"Title: A Quick Stop at a Bustling Spot

I recently visited this bustling eatery for a quick falafel sandwich and some baba ghanoush to-go. Despite the crowd, the staff members were incredibly hospitable, offering water as I waited—which was a nice touch. The tech-savvy touch of menus on iPads was notable, though my cravings were set on classics.

The falafel laffa was delightful, expertly seasoned and satisfyingly crunchy. As for the baba ghanoush, it was a smoky, creamy treat, paired with some of the best pita bread I've had. The only hiccup in an otherwise flavorful experience was the tahini, which didn't quite hit the mark for me.

The interior ambiance added to the charm, promising a comfortable dine-in experience for next time. This place definitely earned a return visit on my list. Highly recommended for a casual bite that doesn't compromise on taste or service.",1
262,"Title: A Delightful Dining Duo – Rockefeller Center & Long Island

If culinary excellence is what you seek, look no further than these two sister establishments, conveniently located in Rockefeller Center and Long Island. On a recent trip extended due to family matters, I had the pleasure of dining at both locations and was thoroughly impressed.

Service at these venues is nothing short of impeccable, setting a high bar for hospitality. The menu, deliciously inviting with its prix fixe option, boasts a variety of dishes that cater to every palate. The grilled octopus, a choice of my cousin who happens to be a chef, received her genuine praise – a testament to its quality.

As for my own experience, the loup de mer was a culinary delight, cooked to perfection and paired exquisitely with yaourti to finish. With food and service that truly stand out, I am eagerly planning to host my next reunion at one of these restaurants when I return to town. A five-star experience not to be missed!",1
19118,"My visit to Ecuadorian Restaurant left an indelible mark thanks to the culinarily delightful experience it provided. Chosen by my students for a lunch during our school trip, the restaurant exceeded all expectations. I savored a perfectly prepared steak with onions served alongside aromatic rice and beans. The young diners in our group were equally pleased; their fried pork chops and grilled chicken were not just swiftly served but also featured generous portions that did not compromise on flavor or texture. This establishment is a testament to quality dining, one that promises to captivate any palate.",1
13201,"Located in the 2nd floor food court of Brookfield Place, I was walking by in search of a vegetarian meal and stopped at Umami because I wanted to try their rendition of the impossible burger and there was happy hour pricing for truffle fries ($3)The impossible vegan burger I ordered had too much mustard and probably too much sauce in general.  It was really messy to eat and just not worth the calories. The menu says it's an impossible patty on a vegan bun with charred green chili salsa, miso mustard, espresso rub, smoky sweet bbq sauce, coleslaw, thinly sliced jalapeño.  The dominant flavor of my meal was mustard and the jalapeños were not thinly sliced so a few bites were a little too spicy.  I can see where Umami was going with these ingredients, I think my burger just wasn't put together properly.  I was excited to try their truffle fries but was so disappointed when they came out with truffle cheese fondue that was lumpy and coagulated.  I was very sad but ate enough of it to not be wasteful. The fries themselves were thin and cooked nicely, most were crisp and untouched by the cheese.  Umami does over different sauces. I tried the garlic aioli which was yummy.  I would've been completely happy to eat the fries without the truffle cheese and just use the aioli.  All in all, it was a decent meal but for $20 for a burger and fries, I'd very much rather eat at Barebuger.",0
15079,"Title: Not Just-ified – A Salad Experience to Skip

My visit to Just Salad left much to be desired. Hyped as a member of the good salad chain league, this establishment fell disappointingly short. The salads lacked inspiration and flavor, far from the culinary delights found in Buffalo, Dallas, Cleveland, the Carolinas, or Houston.

Service mirrored the food – abysmal. An interminable wait for what could only be described as a bowl of blandness. Coupled with sky-high New York City prices, the experience just wasn't worth it.

New York might be a pioneer in the salad chain concept, but Just Salad is no testament to that legacy. Invention, as the English with soccer, doesn’t guarantee excellence. My advice: Just Avoid.",1
19957,"I recently visited this super amazing spot where every aspect of the experience was on point. The drinks were crafted to perfection, complementing a delicious food menu that tantalized my taste buds.

This spot is downright dope, and I'm already looking forward to my next visit. Cheers to a fabulous dining experience!",1
18151,"Found this gem because I was looking for a good restaurant for xiao long bao near the MET. The restaurant looks very fancy and high class. It was a very nice restaurant that I thought was way too expensive. I feel like we were mostly paying for the environment around us because the upper east side is a very nice location. My friend and I ordered bok choy, chicken dumplings, shrimp dumplings, and the pork soup dumplings (2 orders because they were really good). We also got an order of 4 chicken dumplings for free because I checked in via Yelp, which I thought was really cool! The soup dumplings were soup-erb and I'm so glad because it was my friends first time having soup dumplings and I wanted it to be a good experience for her! I am happy to say she loved them! And she doesn't even like pork but she thought they were delicious! I found the soup to be very yummy! The chicken dumplings and the shrimp dumplings were meh. The chicken dumplings didn't taste very fresh to me, the skin tasted kind of dry and I found the shrimp dumplings to be pretty bland, although I got it because I really like that it comes in a clear rice skin. These definitely could've been better in my opinion. I gave the restaurant 4 stars because overall the food was delicious, but it definitely wasn't good enough to be as expensive as it was.",0
10389,"Lions and Tigers and Squares delivers on taste with a pizza that's definitely worth trying. Yet, popularity seems to be a double-edged sword here; akin to its sister chain, Artichoke, the price for their pepperoni pizza has stealthily climbed from $9 to $11 within just a few months. I find myself drawn back, but tend to stick to the original personal pie, which remains a more wallet-friendly $5. If you can swallow the price hike, it's a flavorful experience.",1
15721,Had a great nye dinner here. They served prefixed meals on that night. The chef started us with butternut squash soup and it's very creamy and delicious. Then we had the fluke crudo which has coconut milk and lemon sauce on top which makes it super yummy. Then we had Brussel sprouts and I think it's the best brussel sprouts I have ever had in my life and I'm not a big fan of brussel sprouts. Then we had the snow crab egg noodles which tasted like caramel and butter and it's just melt in your mouth!!! it was definitely the best dish there. We had the steak as our main course which was just ok because they're better steaks out there at steakhouses. Then we finished with a chocolate ganach. Fire in the sky is a must have cocktail very delicious and it's not too spicy. The food is 5 stars and the service was also perfect. The only thing not so great is the space and the decor for a Michelin one star restaurant. Our table was wobbly and people kept butting on our table when they want to get out to go to the bathroom. The bathroom is also very dark. I think if the vibe improves a little in this restaurant then it would be amazing!!!,0

Sunny and 78 degrees with a gentle breeze... the only thing that could make it better was a banging inexpensive meal with my girlfriends (oh and the bottomless mimosas).. And Dos Caminos delivered!When we went to make a reservation online, we were told there were no available seats, but since we were literally right next door at the Gansevoort, we decided to walk over and try our luck. It paid off as we were able to have a seat outside to people watch while we ate!Jessie was very friendly and accommodating. She's of great value to the establishment. We ordered the bottomless drinks with brunch.. I tried the prickly pear margarita which was disappointingly sour and not really good, unfortunately... mimosas had a solid amount of bubbly in it. But, the real hit was the food!!Oh so tasty... great guacamole... empanadas de platanos were divine!! stuffed plantains, guys!! The queso fundidos were just rich and decadently salty...

21063,"Title: A Vegetarian Haven with Flavorful Asian Touches

I recently visited a delightful restaurant that truly caters to vegetarian tastes. They showcase an impressive variety of Asian sauces, which adds an adventurous spin to the dining experience. Unfortunately, they were out of avocado on my visit, but the accommodating staff doubled up on the tofu for me. I indulged in two distinct flavors – the creamy Peanut Curry and the fiery Spicy Gochujang. In retrospect, creating my own bowl would have been a savvy choice, but that just gives me a reason to return. Both dishes exuded freshness and offered a guilt-free, healthy satisfaction. This spot is definitely a must-try for a quick, tasty bite.",1

1758,"Title: A Juicy Triumph at Flip'n Toss

If your taste buds are screaming for a burger that defines 'juicy,' then Flip'n Toss is your burger haven. The moment I entered, the air was thick with the promise of indulgence, laden with the scent of sizzling patties (an aroma that burger aficionados will find irresistible).

The expansive menu caters to various cravings, from the classic comfort of mac n cheese with customizable toppings to the decadence of shakes. I surrendered to the glory of the Raclette Burger, a masterpiece stacked with a succulent beef patty, gooey raclette cheese, earthy mushrooms, sweet caramelized onions, smoky bacon, and a lavish swipe of truffle mayo. It was a burger that fulfilled every desire, leaving no room for doubt about its flavor-packed prowess.

On the flip side, while the idea of guac fries tantalized, the execution fell short. The fries were thick-cut (not to my preference), and the guacamole erred on the saltier side. The raw jalapeños were an unnecessary jolt to the palate.

The cozy quarters of the establishment might require a brief wait, but patience typically pays off as seating becomes available. In summary, Flip'n Toss is a strong contender where the main event shines and side acts, like the guac fries, may be better left behind.",1
13549,"Title: A Happy Hour Gem by Bryant Park

I recently enjoyed my second visit to this delightful find nestled near Bryant Park, and the experience was as pleasing as the first. Their happy hour, running until 7pm on weekdays, is a steal with wine priced at a reasonable $8-9 per glass. The best part? These deals aren't confined to the bar area—you can indulge at your table as well.

The space itself impresses with ample room and tasteful decor, creating a comfortable ambiance for diners. The service deserves applause; it was nothing short of attentive.

Moving onto the cuisine, the pesto gnocchi was a revelation—light, fluffy, and paired generously with Brussels sprouts. This dish is perfect for a solo indulgence or for sharing. The Thai mussels, accompanied by rice, also hit the mark with their tender quality and are ideal for communal dining.

Appetizers here promise to tantalize; the burrata was served with a satisfying portion of tomatoes. The mushroom flatbread is another must-try, offering six slices of cheesy goodness. For a touch of sweetness, the honey Brie with rye bread is a delightful choice.

All in all, this spot is a stellar choice for a sit-down meal near Bryant Park—whether you're sipping on discounted wine or savoring a meal shared with friends. Highly recommended!",1
10221,"Not sure why there are so many bad reviews. I've been here twice. The sushi was solid both times. The downside is that sashimi and kani salads are not included with AYE. Our sushi came on a sushi boat. Loved the presentation! Service was spectacular. The ambiance is nothing special, but if you sit at one of the tables by the windows, you can take a look at third ave. This is a small, but nice sushi place. You can bring your own wine, but a corking fee applies.",0
10909,"Nice flavor from simple vegetables! We have been craving Chinese and Kings just hit the spot! We got several dishes to try including garlic string beans, eggplant, jasmine rice, ocean rice with shrimp, potstickers, and crispy oyster mushrooms. My menu that was served to us was in terrible condition - as you can see from the picture someone was using it as a table mat, splattered with food and extremely sticky. Yikes! We were served spicy cabbage first, which gives a nice kick start. Our food arrived slowly after. Being that this was our second time we had to order some of the same dishes (just to satisfy out taste buds). String beans were as tasty as we remembered them - they are actually our favorite dish!!!! (If you are a vegetarian, they can hold off bacon or substitute it with tofu). We also got eggplant (again!) but it was as delicious. The crispy mushrooms were good, but a bit spicy. The pot stickers were ok, but I would not order them again. Same case with ocean rice. Just get jasmine rice, it's more flavorful and moist. Location is pretty convenient, right by the highway, and with ""free"" parking below it (we parked there several times there with no tickets so far but I'm not sure if it's paid or free). We have been here before (very late night) without any wait time, but this time coming around 8 pm we had to wait 30 min (there is ABSOLUTELY no room to wait anywhere inside, keep that in mind especially when it's raining out). During our initial visit we sat in the front room, but this time we were seated in the back room, which we liked more due to less foot traffic. We saw an outdoor patio area in the back, which looks nice.Service is great! They were pleasant during both visits.",0
18920,"Title: A Heavenly Taste of Israel

If taste buds had the ability to sing, mine would be in a full-blown chorus after visiting this gem! The Israeli Breakfast is a must-try, with perfectly cooked eggs, creamy Labneh cheese, delectable home fries, a fresh Israeli salad, and warm pita – a true morning delight.

Hesitant at first, I took a chance on the Burekas. Thankfully, the feta-olive stuffing was a gentle nudge rather than a bold punch, making for a sublime savory experience. The puff pastry was a cloud of joy – soft, moist, and utterly irresistible.

Portion sizes? Generous. Value? Excellent. Every bite felt like a bargain for such high-quality flavors.

Final Verdict? A resounding 5 stars – don't walk, run to this culinary haven! You simply cannot leave without trying it; your palate will thank you!",1

Each dish, from appetizer to dessert, was a testament to the culinary prowess of the kitchen.

3156,"Visited the crown to grab a few drinks and kill some time before dinner in the Chinatown area. I had never heard of this spot and it was actually recommended to me the same day I ended up visiting. I'm a big fan of rooftop bars and this place definitely goes on my ""must visit again"" list. If not for the views and hospitality, for the set up of the spot itself.I walked in around 5:30 on a Thursday afternoon following the work day. I took the elevator up to the rooftop and was surprised to see how empty it was. There were a few people at the bar and maybe only one or two parties seated. I set myself up at the bar and ordered an IPA and casually read a book while enjoying my drink. This place is quiet enough that you can read a book at the bar, but also nice enough that you could bring a friend here to catch up over drinks.The view was astounding as well! Unobstructed from canal street, you're able to see midtown clearly, as well as FiDi behind you. I can easily see this being a go to spot for many during the warmer seasons. Definitely visit if you're looking for a classy rooftop bar where you won't break the bank.",0
10116,"Nestled discreetly, this charming spot may be compact but it delivers big on flavor. With a menu boasting traditional dumplings, including a delightful Impossible meat option, the variety impresses.

The warm and welcoming staff rounds out a dining experience that leaves you planning your next visit. A return trip is certainly on the cards!",1
15902,"Tucked away in the bustling city, the eatery is no stranger to crowds at any given mealtime, breakfast included. Renowned for its straightforward menu, it draws patrons in primarily for the congee and rice rolls. On a brisk winter day, the preserved egg congee emerges as a comforting delight, surprisingly fit for not only the unwell but as a hearty start to the day or a modest meal in its own right.

The rice rolls are satisfactory, generous in their fillings, yet they leave a little to be desired considering the price point—similar offerings can be found elsewhere, with a lighter impact on the wallet and comparable taste.

The establishment thrives on its no-nonsense, efficient service; a haven for those seeking a quick, unfussy bite. If dinner is on the cards, aiming for a pre-rush 5:30 PM arrival might secure you a seat. And though a queue might form, it often moves swiftly, as the clientele are there with a single purpose: to savor their meal and proceed with their day.",1

However, the lentil burger was a unanimous hit, with its delightful falafel-like flavor. It's clear this spot continues to shine with its unique offerings. Highly recommend, especially for the lentil burger aficionados!",1
2287,"Title: Mixed Feelings at a Busy Mexican Eatery

My experience at this Mexican restaurant left our party of nine with a blend of satisfaction and frustration. On a bustling Saturday evening, our waiter unfortunately missed the mark; his unpleasant demeanor and repeated mistakes with both our drink and food orders soured the atmosphere. To add insult to injury, we found ourselves overcharged for drinks.

The food, however, was a redeeming factor. We kicked off our meal with exceptional tableside guacamole and a vibrant salsa, setting a high expectation for the rest of the dinner. Once corrected, the variety of flavorful margaritas, such as the standout smoky ginger beer margarita I enjoyed, were a hit at our table. The Mexican corn offered a delightful taste and a teeth-friendly off-the-cob presentation. Most of us opted for tacos and a few praised their fish dishes, while I chose the tres enchiladas—advertised as a mix but served with all chicken, a detail our waiter got wrong, albeit favorably for my preference.

The menu proved challenging to navigate with descriptions that left me resorting to an online search to decipher unfamiliar sauces and cheeses—a needless hassle that could be easily rectified with a clearer menu.

After a lengthy 2.5-hour dinner, we skipped dessert in favor of our next engagement. While there were certainly highlights, the likelihood of a swift return for Mexican cuisine here is slim, given the ample alternatives that promise less hassle.",1

12060,"Title: Utterly Neglected at Noon

My experience at this downtown New York City establishment was astonishingly poor. Arriving at approximately 11:45 a.m., we were nonchalantly instructed by the host to seat ourselves in the bar area. Once seated, the absence of staff was immediately noticeable; no bartender or server was in sight to take our order. The few patrons at the bar had empty glasses, signaling a lack of attention.

We spent a quarter of an hour waiting, resorting to our phones for entertainment, yet still, no one came to assist us. Taking the initiative, we approached the host to inform her of the deserted bar area. Her reaction was one of surprise, yet frustratingly, she took no action to amend the situation.

In the end, we had no choice but to leave and dine at Ruby Tuesday's. It was mind-boggling: lunchtime in the heart of the city, and not a single server or bartender on the floor, coupled with what seemed to be an untrained hostess. It's difficult to comprehend how such a potentially buzzing location could fail so fundamentally in customer service.",1
18589,"Title: Quick and Satisfying Slice Before Lady Liberty

My lunch stop at this cozy spot turned out to be a delightful surprise. Despite its compact size, the restaurant offers a welcome dining area in the back, a rare find in a city brimming with stand-up eateries—a relief for those who prefer to enjoy their meal seated.

The menu selection hit the spot with both a meat lovers and a white pizza slice on our table. The white slice was particularly memorable for its thin, crispy crust—possibly thanks to a dusting of cornmeal—giving it a satisfying crunch and perfectly balanced with cheese. Although I didn't try the meat slice, my companion assured me it was equally delicious.

Given more time, I'd have indulged in another slice, but a watchful eye on my carb intake and our tight schedule had me restrained. While not the epitome of cleanliness, with a rather cramped bathroom, the establishment at least provides the necessary facilities.

At just over $11 for two slices and a shared drink, the value is undeniable for New York City. This is a place I certainly plan to revisit when the pizza craving hits and time is of the essence.",1
12309,"Title: Warm Comfort at Ichiraku Ramen

I found solace in a bowl of ramen at Ichiraku after a cold, jet-lagged workday. The cozy establishment welcomed me with a mere 20-minute wait on a Wednesday evening — a perfect interlude for a quick drink at the neighboring 3-story pub.

Choosing the Ichiraku for its enticing dashi broth did not disappoint. The ramen boasted tender pork, scallions, and delightful wood ear mushrooms, accompanied by a ""spicy ball"" that promised heat. While the added spice fell short of my expectations, the flavors melded beautifully. Do yourself a favor and try the pork buns; they're a must-have.

Service stumbled slightly with a 10-minute delay for drinks, but this minor hiccup didn't overshadow the overall experience. Ichiraku Ramen has earned a return visit from this comfort food seeker.",1
3518,"Title: Mixed Feelings on AYCE Sushi Spot

My companion and I were eager to indulge in some all-you-can-eat sushi after a considerable hiatus, and we chose to visit this restaurant. Upon arrival at 4 PM, seating was ample, and we were promptly accommodated in the spacious venue, split between front and back sections.

However, our timing meant we missed the more wallet-friendly lunch price of $18, and had to settle for the dinner rate of $30, with an option to add unlimited drinks for $39. The ordering process, though innovative with an iPad menu, proved to be a test of patience. It took an excessive 30 minutes for our rolls and sashimi orders to arrive. Thus, for future patrons, it’s advisable to preemptively order your next round of food early.

When the food did arrive, it was generally satisfying. The variety of sushi rolls, such as the Dancing Mango and Spicy Dragon, alongside the sashimi and the salmon skin salad featured good quality, fresh fish with generous cuts. The only minor drawback was the wish for a crisper texture in the salmon skin salad.

The disappointment, however, lay in the service. An unfortunate mix-up had a server watering down our ginger ale, and attempts to garner attention were ignored by the preoccupied staff. The mood in the restaurant was further dampened by erratic lighting changes throughout our stay. Moreover, the hurried nature of the staff as we approached the end of our 2-hour limit left a sour taste, especially following an automatic 18% gratuity added to our bill for a party of two.

In summary, while the food at this AYCE sushi restaurant met our expectations in terms of freshness and taste, the lackluster service and the mishap with the drinks make it hard for us to consider a return visit.",1
2605,Brunch is about $17 with a mini drink. Steak and eggs were pretty yummy. I ordered medium well ( should have ordered medium) they cooked the steak well done. The regular margarita is much better than the one that comes w brunch. Jalapeño margarita was amazing. Guac and salsa were okay. Bathrooms were clean and service was good. It's the city so you're pretty close to everyone.,0
2708,"During my recent visit to the restaurant, I opted for the Big Kahuna bowl with a salad base. Unfortunately, the portion size left something to be desired, coming up smaller than expected. On a positive note, the fish included in the dish was notably fresh, but it regrettably lacked any distinctive flavor. I chose to enhance my bowl with seaweed salad, ginger, and wonton chips as toppings. Despite these additions, the overall dining experience can only be described as average, with no particular aspect standing out as remarkable.",1
18702,It's a small bar with good drinks.  Some folks refer to it as a dive bar but it really wasn't bad. (Assuming Dive bars are bad). Staff was quick to get your drinks and give you attended when they are empty.  We didn't have any food.Decor is very unique and it's worth walking around and looking at it,0
13381,"My recent visit to this inviting restaurant last Sunday was a pleasant experience. The atmosphere was laid-back, with few other patrons, allowing for personalized attention from the bartender. While the names of the rum concoctions I tried escape me due to their potency, the expert blend of liquor and fruit juices was memorable.

Sharing a spinach dip appetizer with my partner, we found it delectable despite the portion size seeming modest -- a perception possibly skewed by hunger and a quick-eating companion. My partner's enthusiasm for the diverse beer selection and the tasting trio underscored the venue's appeal to hops aficionados.

Observing my friends' engrossment with their chicken and waffles suggested the dish's undeniable appeal, while another friend's generously topped and well-distributed nachos promised a future order from me. Although the classic burger was a hit, the separate charge for fries felt out of step with the meal's price.

My lobster sliders were flavorful, though the over-chopped meat made for a challenging consumption. Accompanying chips fell short, lacking in taste and texture, leading me to opt for my boyfriend's superior fries.

In summary, I would revisit for the nachos, another round of those excellent rum drinks, and to indulge in a savory burger, confidently skipping the lobster sliders for a more satisfying choice.",1
15131,"Title: A Disappointing Experience

I must express my deep dissatisfaction with my recent visit to this restaurant, which has ensured that I'll never return. Despite having a large party of 10-12, we were met with a lack of attentiveness from the staff that was unacceptable. Even though we arrived two hours late for our reservation, it's no excuse for the subpar service we received.

The server was uncooperative, and we repeatedly had to interrupt her just to place our orders. Compounding the chaos, the host tried to dismantle our table while we were still actively ordering and receiving our meals.

Mistakes with our orders were the icing on an already sour cake. We were handed the wrong dishes, and my rum punch was so disappointing that I questioned its authenticity. My request for a mango mojito somehow translated into receiving an unwanted coconut drink. It was clear to me that the staff didn't care about customer satisfaction.

In summary, poor service and the inability to handle a large party or correct order mistakes have led me to conclude that this establishment is not worth another visit.",1
11910,"Sao Mai is a go-to of one of my friends and husband for modestly priced and delicious traditional Vietnamese food. I've been here several times and tried a variety of dishes, but their beef pho here is one of the best I've had in New York, aside from Saigon Shack. Ambience is basic and no frills, and service is what you'd normally expect from a restaurant with cheaper prices.This is not a place where you need to make a reservation, but expect it to be busy from 7 onwards, before that, you will be seated immediately.",0
18940,"Tucked beside the celebrated Los Tacos No.1 in Chelsea Market, mokbar has stolen my culinary heart. Though initially on a taco quest, the irresistible allure of dumplings had us pivoting. Opting for the Kalbi dumplings led to a delightful surprise—these are, without exaggeration, the finest dumplings I've ever tasted. They effortlessly eclipsed the fame of the neighboring tacos. Mokbar’s offerings are not only delectable but also kindly priced. I'm eagerly anticipating my next visit for another round of those exquisite Kalbi dumplings. Highly recommend giving mokbar a try!",1
20660,"Title: A Disheartening Experience at a Favored Food Truck

After eagerly standing in line for two and a half hours due to understandable pandemic-related delays, my anticipation turned to deep disappointment with my favorite food truck. Despite my loyalty to their brand, the lack of lobster in my taco, an oversight that should have been easily caught by the staff, was unacceptable. The day was marred by disorganization, and an apparent lack of quality checks on orders. The company's response, while prompt, requesting an email to address the issue, does little to rectify the immediate letdown of receiving a subpar meal. My experience today was regrettable, and I hope to see tangible improvements in their service.",1
20305,"Title: Cozy Venue with Exceptional Service

I recently visited this understated gem for a lunch date post-class, around 1:40pm. Despite its discreet location, the warmth of the staff immediately strikes you. They offer possibly the best customer service I've experienced—attentive without being overbearing, ensuring our needs were met with promptness and genuine care.

Although small and a bit noisy due to its popularity (especially among groups, hinting that it's ideal for gatherings), the restaurant maintains a vibrant atmosphere. The pricing is fair, and it's matched by the quality of the food—simply delicious.

A special nod to our waiter, who charmingly navigated our broken Spanish and shared a laugh with us. His hospitality only added to the delightful experience. I'm already looking forward to my next visit!",1
14420,"Title: A Gastronomic Delight at Fogo de Chao, Santana Row

My recent dining experience at Fogo de Chao located in Santana Row, San Francisco, left a lasting impression, distinguishing itself from other Brazilian steakhouses. Taking advantage of the Restaurant Week deal, the meal was a steal at $42 for dinner, offering a selection of seven mouthwatering meats including sirloins, pork ribs, chicken, sausage, and bacon-wrapped steak.

The inclusive salad bar was a feast in itself, with an array of options from cured meats and the crispiest bacon to a variety of veggies, several cheese types, rice, and beans. The decor was breathtaking - a testament to Fogo's attention to detail, creating a warm and sophisticated ambiance.

Reservations were honored nearly on time, despite our 9 pm booking during a bustling service. The food, both from the salad bar and the meats served tableside, was delectable. However, service slightly faltered when it came to timely provision of sauce for the meats, requiring multiple reminders, and the initial lack of variety in the meat selection presented to us.

Notwithstanding these minor hiccups, the experience was close to flawless. A highlight worth mentioning, and not to be overlooked, is the complimentary cheese bread. Do yourself a favor and order an extra helping.

Overall, Fogo de Chao in Santana Row offers a supreme dining experience - a must-visit for meat lovers and those appreciating fine food. My rating: 4.5 out of 5.",1
1708,There is an amazing $26 lunch special. The quality of food here is tops.Ate:Spring pea soupBranzinoI don't even like split pea but this had the lightest texture and foamy top. Generous and super delicious fish. A real culinary treasure close to Times Square.,0
2669,"So we came here because it was close to Madison square garden and we were going to a show ... I made reservations because I knew that places around events and at happy hr time can get packed and I was right. Unfortunately the traffic was horrible that day - and even tho I called that was was running a lil late- by the time I parked in the deck across the street and came in- I arrived 20 mins after my reservation. Also the table they were going to give us was going to be upstairs - unfortunately my sister who was ubering from another location - broke her foot and had one of those scooters so it was be impossible to get her to the upstairs floor. I get it- the front desk was annoyed with me but these were the circumstances and it was also my sister's bday that I wrote on the reservation. Anyway they didn't have any 3 seats downstairs even though I saw plenty of seating lol. Anyway I opted to take the two seater and I would stand but when our sweet waitress came over - I told her the situation - she talked to her boss Nile and he gave us a better table with three seats like no problem!!!! Awesome . We were situated by the time by sister arrived. I don't remember the other waitress's name but I was very thankful.  Our new waitress Rachael was also a gem- attentive and friendly. I had the Harry's Martini twice cuz it was super yummy. But step pops had a beer and sister had wine They ordered the burgers and I got the fried chicken sandwich. They said they liked their meal. The chicken sandwich and fries were ok but I ate it because I was so hungry since it was the only thing I ate that day. Out waitress Rachael was able to figure out my sly cryptic non verbal movements to get a Birthday dessert for my sister in which her and her coworkers helped sing happy birthday for my sister . It was a success! My sister had a string of bad luck including breaking her ankle 2 days before birthday and her long awaited tickets to see John Mayer at Garden . So this is my breakdown Food 3/4Drink 4 Service 5 by Nile, Rachael and the other waitress who helped us get a better table!!! Thank you so much",0
1262,"Estela wasn't mind-blowing, but it was great. Very fish-focused menu, which my friend and I were cool with - we shared the hake, sea bream, mussels, ricotta dumplings, and chocolate cake for dessert. The dumplings and cake were my favorite. The dishes were thoughtful and creative enough; the ingredients were fresh. Service was great. I'd try the burrata and beef tartare next time.",0
18111,"Hidden gem you would never expect to find in midtown. Tap Haus 33 elevates the beer hall concept to new heights- even better that it's self-serve. We had an excellent server who did everything he could to help me pick the right selection (there are so many options!). Additionally, we ordered 20 wings for $25 (a combination of buffalo and BBQ) which is beyond reasonable. I want to try the hummus platter, and the chicken wings and waffles next! You access the menu using a QR code (like how you take a picture of the tag at Zara). You pay for the beer using a refillable card, similar to what you would use at Dave and Busters. You pay for the food separately. We have left over money so I can't wait to come back this Sunday and enjoy some beer and football.",0

It's an amazing combo of hot bread and ice cream. The bread was so soft and cooked just right. Was expected to taste this good.Soil Sorbet 8/10 I loved the tartness of the raspberry sorbet with the chocolate soil. You water the soil with chocolate milk and it breaks right through the soil. What a fun and creative dessert with a great balance of flavors!Matcha Lava Cake 7/10 I love matcha and I love chocolate so this was amazing. The outside was cooked just right and the inside was gooey and warm chocolate. The matcha flavor could've stood out more though.Overall, I would eat all these desserts again. However, the price was a bit expensive. Was around $10+ for each dessert, but that didn't stop me from splurging. Additionally, the atmosphere didn't cut it for me. The first location was okay, the place was a bit small and underground. The second was in a loud and noisy cafeteria. With this type of dessert and presentation I feel like the atmosphere should be more relaxed and gentle and in a more formal setting, it should be an elegant dessert place, not casual.",0

2053,"Title: Pre-Show Perfection at Tavola

My dining companions and I stumbled upon Tavola, a dining gem that easily accommodated our pre-Broadway show timing. The convenience of Yelp reservations led us to a surprisingly private experience at a community table, cleverly sectioned off by wooden boxes for a touch of intimacy.

The meal commenced with a delightful serving of fried calamari, complemented by a fresh pesto sauce and bread. Our entrees included the satisfactory spinach fettuccine with chicken meatballs and a satisfying eggplant pasta. However, the star of the show was the spaghetti fruitti di mare, a generous ensemble of succulent shrimp, mussels, clams, and calamari.

The finale, a pistachio gelato encased in a crushed amaretti shell, was nothing short of divine. Each spoonful was a taste of heaven, perfectly capping off our meal.

In summary, Tavola delivered on all fronts – convenience, ambiance, and culinary delight. Highly recommended for a pre-theater feast!",1
2440,"I recently dined at a local gem where I savored their Toro Ssam Bap, and it may just be the best dish I've ever encountered. The balance of saltiness and richness was impeccable, enhanced by the delightful crunch of radish. Additionally, the So Ramyun I tried had an unexpectedly thick texture, yet it managed to be neither greasy nor overpowering. It was a comforting meal that left a lasting impression on my palate. Highly recommended!",1
1101,"Title: A Slice of Naples in NYC

If you're yearning for authentic Neapolitan pizza without crossing the Atlantic, look no further than this unassuming gem. The pizzas boast a dough that's been nurtured to perfection, evidenced by the tantalizing charred bubbles and that dreamy crust—soft, chewy, and miraculously springy. Far from being underdone, it's a masterful execution of the Neapolitan art.

Beyond pizza, the grilled calamari and spaghetti with meatballs hold their own—flavorful and satisfying. Coupled with the super friendly staff and wallet-friendly prices, this spot is a must-visit. I'm already plotting my next visit on my next trip to NYC.",1
3293,"Title: A Burger Experience You Can't Scroll Past

Instagram did it again, luring me into a compact, dimly-lit restaurant with the promise of burger bliss – and it didn't disappoint. Seated by the window, we experienced a slight wait before being greeted by the server, but the anticipation only heightened the reward.

Drinks to start; the Reyes Rush was a delightful concoction, whilst The 8 Ball received a thumbs-up from my companion. But let's talk burgers. The El Chapo – an Instagram legend that lived up to every pixel of hype. With its tantalizing Burrata, it was like biting into a gastronomic treasure – rich in flavor and oh-so-satisfying.

Not ones to stop there, we ventured into the realm of 'build your own' with a creation featuring a fried egg, Gruyere cheese, and garlic aioli. It was a heavenly trio atop a perfectly cooked patty that had us uttering praises.

The service may have lagged slightly, surprising for the size of the place, but it was a minor hiccup in an otherwise enjoyable dining experience. Prices didn't make our wallets weep, and with burgers this good, I'm already planning my next visit.",1
18634,"I recently dined at a local restaurant and was thoroughly impressed by their offerings. For enthusiasts of Thai cuisine, their Tom Yum soup is a must-try; I'd rate it a perfect 10/10 for its zesty and robust flavors. Additionally, the $11 lunch special, which includes both an appetizer and an entree, provides excellent value and a satisfying culinary experience. Highly recommended for a delightful meal that doesn't break the bank.",1
11843,"*solely based on restaurant week experience*The food was ok, prices ok, space ok - hence the 3star. The restaurant was really tight - ie one step beyond cozy. It seemed like there was a lot of demand due to resto week but they packed everyone into two of the dining areas (there are three ""rooms"" of sorts). Kind of uncomfortable to eat when you feel cramped - not to mention all the winter gear everyone is sporting. I got the French onion soup, rabbit, and a banana brulee. The soup was alright, I realized I am not a fan of french onion soup but i think if i was i would have enjoyed. The rabbit was quite good but the portion size was very, very small. And i know its not supposed to be expected but they served it with rice but the portion of rice was literally the smallest i have ever had in my life (think three spoonfuls). The banana brulee was pretty good, kinda banana pudding-y but obviously more creamy. My friend got the pate as an appetizer which i think was a good start and the Cornish Hen which was actually quite good and a large portion to boot. Overall i don't think i would go again for resto week or even on a regular day..",0
1064,"I recently revisited Roberta's, this time at their new 52nd Street location through Mealpal, and I decided to try their much-talked-about Bee Sting pizza. At a discounted Mealpal price, it seemed like a reasonable deal compared to its original $12-14 tag.

The Bee Sting's promise of a spicy-sweet combination from tomato, mozzarella, soppressata, basil, chili, chili oil, and honey had my taste buds intrigued, especially with its rave reviews on Yelp. Unfortunately, the pizza fell short of my expectations. The crust was disappointingly thin and dry, lacking the chewiness I look forward to in a good pizza base. While the soppressata was flavorful, it missed the mark on spiciness, making me curious about how it compares to their pepperoni option.

Although I enjoyed the fresh basil and would have preferred more of it, the mozzarella was thinly sliced to the point of being too dry. The tomato sauce, sweetened by the honey, reminded me of apple sauce, an interesting but not entirely pleasing combination for me, given that I'm not a fan of that particular honey flavor.

The heat from the chili and chili oil was distinct, creating a targeted spicy sensation in the middle of my tongue. This heat lingered uncomfortably even after finishing the meal, an experience that seemed to align with the ""bee sting"" theme but didn't enhance the overall flavors.

Surprisingly, the pizza didn't sustain my hunger until the evening, leaving me disappointed in its satiety level. While I might consider ordering the Bee Sting again through Mealpal for its value and novelty, I do so with tempered expectations, as it has more shortcomings than merits in my book.",1
19432,"**Restaurant Delivery Review**

I recently tried delivery from this establishment and had a mixed experience with their offerings. Out of the three dishes ordered, the pork dumplings with chili oil stood out; they were delightful and came with a flavor-rich sauce definitely worth recommending. However, the pork soup dumplings were underwhelming, presenting a thick dough with an almost hollow center that failed to impress. The most disappointing was the beef with bok choy—it lacked the flavor and texture one would expect given its rave reviews, with a mushy beef consistency that suggested it might have been fried and subsequently drenched in sauce. Based on this experience, I am hesitant to order delivery from them again.",1
20396,"I recently visited a charming little spot in a bustling tourist area, a mini Irish pub chain known for its cozy, authentic ambiance. The cleanliness and aesthetic appeal were immediately noticeable upon entering—a welcoming, pretty setting perfect for a casual meal or a drink.

175,"Title: A Carnivore's Delight at a Buzzing New York Pizzeria

I must confess, this bustling New York pizzeria stole my heart, convincing me to dine there twice! Early whispers of brusque staff fell flat in light of their brisk efficiency—which, in the city that never sleeps, is more a feature than a bug. As a first-timer, decision paralysis could have struck, given the smorgasbord of choices, but the all-meat pizza was a clear winner with its mouthwatering melange of chewy, savory perfection. 

During my first visit, I opted for the pepperoni square pizza, which unfortunately wasn't thoroughly heated, detracting from the experience. Nonetheless, it wasn't enough to deter a second try, where I gambled on the garlic and Romano cheese pie. A minor miscalculation on my part—I'm not a Romano fan and the garlic was shy to my taste buds. 

A useful tip for future patrons: Make your pizza selection swiftly, avoid digital distractions, skip the unnecessary condiments, and mind your manners by cleaning up after your meal. With these in mind, you're in for a satisfying slice of New York's finest.",1
13368,"I recently visited a local gem that had been featured on ""Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives,"" and it did not disappoint. The burger was the highlight, boasting a patty bursting with flavor that will have your taste buds rejoicing. The potatoes also held their own, offering a tasty accompaniment to the star of the show.

However, it's important to note that this spot is a cash-only establishment, so come prepared. The only downside was the service; the staff behind the counter could use a lesson in hospitality, as they were rather gruff and not the friendliest.

Despite the service snags, the food alone makes this place worth a visit. It didn't earn the full five stars due to the service, but for a flavor-packed meal, it's a solid choice.",1
13811,"This place is amazing and so underrated!!! Today was my second time going and they definitely did not disappoint. Just be aware that the place is pretty small, so keep your  party size small, even if you make a reservation in advance.We walked in and the jazz band was playing. They were incredible and played for most of the time we were there. Ernesto was our server and seated us towards the middle of the restaurant. He helped us decide which bottomless to get - which is a GREAT deal by the way; $30 for bottomless drinks AND a brunch entree of your choice. Ernesto brought us pitchers because he thought that would be more efficient than coming to keep filling our glasses. He was definitely right. The food came out at a good time- everything was hot and delicious! Their fingerling potatoes and salad that they bring you on the side are to DIE for!! I also ordered an egg white omelette with mushroom and spinach - also delicious!! You will definitely be able to find something you like on this menu.

14588,"Title: Mixed Feelings at The Lodge by Urbanspace

I visited The Lodge by Urbanspace intrigued by the buzz surrounding it, especially to check out a particular vendor that had gained Instagram fame. The place was surprisingly crowded and smaller than anticipated, which made it quite challenging to navigate. Moreover, finding a spot to sit proved to be a little bit of a mission.

Food-wise, the options were a bit of a letdown as nothing much piqued my interest, and to add to the disappointment, the few items that did catch my eye had sold out early in the day. Considering it was the day after Christmas, I assume they hadn't restocked from the holiday rush, which was unfortunate.

We did make a purchase from The Stackery, enticed by their visually appealing treats that seemed perfect for an Instagram shot. My daughter opted for the ""YULE WANT S'MORE,"" which was indeed picture-perfect and lived up to its social media reputation in terms of presentation. However, when it came down to taste, it was overwhelmingly sweet. It was so rich that just a few tastes were enough for our group of five.

In a nutshell, The Lodge is great for those looking for a photo op, but in terms of culinary satisfaction, it may fall short unless you have a sweet tooth and don't mind braving the crowds.",1
10266,"Title: ""Brunching on the Bright Side Takes a Dark Turn at Seasoned Vegan""

I ventured into Seasoned Vegan with high hopes, enticed by the promise of appetizing vegan brunch options. Sadly, my experience echoes Batman's dark sentiment: what began as a heroic discovery sadly morphed into something far less commendable.

The bustling brunch atmosphere is expected, yet it should not excuse the alarming lack of service quality I encountered. My request for a proper mimosa was dismissed with a disappointing ""nah,"" as I was presented with a suspiciously opaque concoction that bore more resemblance to spicy orange soda than the champagne-infused delight one might anticipate.

On a positive note, the culinary offerings, including the soy chicken with sweet potato pancakes and the shrimp po'boy, were undeniably scrumptious. The kitchen clearly has its craft finely tuned.

However, the abysmal service dramatically undercut the savory triumphs of the meal. Witnessing my server exchange her duties for a spontaneous dance-off while I sat, ignored and eager to depart, was disheartening to say the least. The palpable disregard for guest attention left me feeling sidelined at an establishment where I had hoped to find a triumphant combination of flavor and care—particularly as I make it a point to support Black-owned businesses.

In closing, while the food at Seasoned Vegan may tickle the taste buds, the service left far more to be desired. A fabulous brunch spot should be measured not only by its menu but also by the respect and attention it affords its patrons. Here’s to hoping the service can be brought up to par with what's on the plate.",1
18433,"I recently dined at this charming spot, where the wallet-friendly prices and adorable ambiance immediately caught my attention. The scallion pancakes were a delightful discovery and left a lasting impression—so much so that I'm already planning a return visit just for them. On the flip side, the soup dumplings didn't quite meet my expectations. I'm on the fence as to whether it's the dish itself or the execution that didn't resonate with me, but either way, they were a letdown. Despite that, the overall experience was positive, and I'd recommend giving this place a try.",1
14540,"Came here for dinner (no reservations made) at around 6pm on a Friday night. The wait for a table was about an hour so we opted for the bar which was fine with us. The restaurant itself is very clean and modern - definitely picture worthy. We were contemplating getting the prix fixe menu but opted against that. We ordered the: Toro ssam bap (5/5): EXCELLENT. The fatty tuna paired perfectly with the rice, daikon and seaweed. You can ask for more seaweed if you run out. Gochu Ramyun (5/5): Not as spicy as I expected, but it was still so delicious! The pork belly was cut into thick yet soft, chewy pieces. So good!Truffle Kong Gook Su (3/5): I usually don't go for cold noodles but decided to try this out for the truffles. It has a very milky taste to it (makes sense, considering it has a cold soy milk broth base) which was a little too overwhelming for me. Paired well with the Gochu Ramen though but would not order this by itself. All in all, had a great time here. Service was excellent too!",0
17165,"I was looking for a place for my 3 years anniversary dinner with my boyfriend. The place we originally wanted to go decided to close for a few days, therefore, I had to research another place. I started looking at top reviewed places in New York City and came to this restaurant, with amazing reviews. The pictures of the interior and food really caught my attention, so I decided to make a reservation (you can make one on their website). First off, the service was amazing. They checked in our jackets once we walked in and we were treated amazingly throughout the whole dinner. The interior really looked amazing like the pictures. The food overall was great, except I don't think they come out hot or warm, but not exactly cold where it's like they were left out for a long time. I got the lobster fried rice, pork buns, short ribs on scallion pancakes, and charred steak. The charred steak was definitely the best with medium rare and the sauce provided. The other dishes were good too, just nothing crazy or special. Overall, I had a good time because they even surprised me with a cake (with my boyfriend planning it), but still really nice that they were able to write ""happy anniversary"" on the plate.",0

18238,"Title: A Subterranean Japanese Gem: Izakaya Mew NYC

At Izakaya Mew, nestled in NYC's vibrant underground, I discovered a delightful culinary oasis. From its upbeat ambiance to the unexpected soundtrack of hip hop and R&B beats, this establishment pulses with a lively spirit that's as tantalizing as its cuisine.

Service was as efficient as it gets, with dishes arriving promptly, piping hot and fresh. The Hakutsuru Sake was the perfect aperitif, light with just a whisper of sweetness. As recommended, my friend and I embarked on a gastronomic journey, sharing a dynamic array of dishes.

The dynamite sushi roll, boasting fresh tuna, set the bar high with a symphony of flavors. Next, the amakara ribs – tender enough to melt in the mouth, cloaked in a delectable sweet and sour sauce. Then the seafood garlic ramen proved to be a steamy, flavor-packed adventure with each slurp.

But the star of the show may well have been the seasonal offering – shrimp, crab, and ricotta-stuffed deep-fried jalapeños. A masterful blend of creamy and spicy, it left our taste buds dancing with joy, mirroring my actual moves to the music.

The feast ended, and the verdict was clear: Izakaya Mew is an absolute must-visit for anyone craving exceptional Japanese cuisine in NYC. It gets a resounding five thumbs up from me – until next time, arigato for an unforgettable dining experience!",1

With a reservation set for brunch, I was greeted by a menu so tantalizing, it was hard to choose just one dish. The portions are incredibly generous, making it ideal for sharing among a group of three or four.

The mimosas we ordered were flawless, striking the perfect balance between bubbly and fresh. Service matched the high quality of the food, with staff that were as friendly as they were attentive.

For the main event, the french toast and chicken & waffles stood out as star selections. Both dishes were cooked to perfection and are perfect for sharing. On a whim, we added a side of pickles to our order, and it proved to be an unexpected delight that complemented the meal.

If you find yourself wandering through Koreatown in New York with a craving for chicken, I've discovered a gem on the second floor of a small food court that deserves a spot on your go-to list. This is now my favorite chicken place in the city, and it's easy to see why once you've dined there.

The service is commendable. We received our food quickly, though it's fair to note that the place wasn't bustling at the time. Despite that, the staff was attentive and ensured we had a pleasant experience.

Now, let's talk about the star of the show - the food. It's simply love on a plate. Their cheesy chicken is a revelation for your taste buds; it's the perfect indulgence for cheese and chicken aficionados alike. And don't get me started on their scallion chicken - it's a delightful treat, especially if you're an onion fan. It's one of those must-try dishes that linger in your memory long after the meal is over.

In summary, this spot offers a delicious escape for anyone looking to indulge in some fantastic chicken dishes. I can't recommend it enough – give it a try, and it might just become your new favorite too.",1
17990,"Title: Not Quite the Authentic Ichiran Experience

Upon my recent visit to the local offshoot of the renowned Japanese ramen chain, it became apparent that this location falls short of its original glory. The taste and pricing do not align with what one might expect from its counterpart in Japan, leaving a sense of longing for authenticity.

The recommended set, which included extra pork and a soft-boiled egg, seemed excessive. The original bowl would have sufficed, highlighting perhaps an unnecessary upsell. An unexpected aspect was the prominent taste of MSG, which may not sit well with some patrons.

Service was disappointingly lackluster. From the moment I was seated, inconsistencies were glaring. I wasn't informed about the water station nor given instructions for the soft-boiled egg— a task left puzzlingly to the diner. Observing nearby guests receive this information only added to the frustration.

The restaurant enforces a no-tipping policy, which is a departure from the norm and may influence the service quality. For those looking to recreate the experience at home, take-out sets are available for purchase.

In summary, while the venture to replicate the quintessential Ichiran experience is commendable, the execution at this location leaves much to be desired. It's simply not on par with the original Japanese standard.",1
19461,"Title: A Must-Visit Rice Haven in NYC

If you're a rice dish aficionado wandering through NYC, you simply can't miss this gem. Be prepared for a line at any time, a testament to the popularity and allure of this spot. With no seating available, I recommend snagging their cha siu rice dish and enjoying it at the nearby park. For those feeling particularly indulgent, the triple combo will elevate your experience — it's an absolute delight and worth every bite. This place remains one of my top picks for a rice dish fix in the city.",1
11169,"Title: Mixed Feelings at Donburiya

After wandering through Central Park, my friend and I ventured to Donburiya, spurred by Yelp recommendations. We arrived at this modest eatery at the cusp of the evening rush, finding it comfortably bustling at 6pm, and significantly busier by the time we left.

A surprising policy at Donburiya is the all-inclusive pricing; no additional tipping is required. Nonetheless, this was not immediately evident—a point of confusion that could have been clarified with a simple mention by the staff or a clear note on the menu or receipt. The surreptitious nature of folded-in gratuity left me feeling slightly deceived, as prices seem steeper with this in mind.

The fare was promptly served, which led us to suspect it may not be freshly made to order. I sampled the katsu curry, which lacked the robustness I had hoped for. The pork's dryness only accentuated the need for an accompanying sauce. Meanwhile, my friend's yakiniku don was met with critique over its peculiar spice, although my own taste detected nothing amiss.

While offering nothing exceptional in culinary terms, the service was adequate—only marred by a solitary instance of having to prompt for a water refill. Considering the implicit tip, the pricing aligns with Midtown's standard, yet fails to justify the food's mediocrity in my eyes. Donburiya could be a passable choice if convenience is your principal concern, but it won't be on my list of establishments to revisit.",1
16365,"Title: A Delightful Brunch Experience at Shoo Shoo

My friends and I ventured into Shoo Shoo for brunch on a Saturday morning and were pleasantly surprised by the relaxed environment, as the restaurant was not overcrowded despite its local fame. Recommended as a must-try spot for brunch in New York, Shoo Shoo easily lived up to its reputation.

Without the need for our reservation, we settled into this aesthetically pleasing eatery adorned with an abundance of greenery, offering both indoor and outdoor seating. Opting for the Shoo Shoo breakfast, I was presented with a generous plate filled with scrambled eggs, a mini baguette, smoked salmon, figs, melon, an assortment of cheeses, yogurt, and a unique salad. The diversity and quality of the food impressed me; each component was delicious and thoughtfully prepared, although the portion size defeated me before I could finish.

The welcoming atmosphere, coupled with the top-notch food, makes Shoo Shoo an excellent choice for anyone looking to indulge in a brunch experience in the city. I wholeheartedly recommend Shoo Shoo for a hearty and satisfying meal in a charming setting.",1
10187,"As a fan of Burger & Lobster, I was excited to dine at their Times Square/Bryant Park location, especially during NYC winter restaurant week. The experience began positively with a warm welcome from the host and exceptional service from our attentive server.

We ordered from the restaurant week menu, intrigued by the special items. Unfortunately, the starters fell short of expectations— the lobster bisque was tepid and under-seasoned, while the mixed seafood calamari was bland. Observing that other diners also sent their soup back for reheating confirmed that it wasn't just us.

Thankfully, the main courses redeemed the meal. A special burger by Pat LaFrieda hit the mark with a perfectly medium-rare patty, and the new fiesta lobster roll was equally satisfying. 

Despite the disappointing appetizers, I remain hopeful that this was an off day for this location of Burger & Lobster and not a symptom of it becoming a run-of-the-mill tourist spot.",1
243,"My friends and I were super excited to eat here especially after looking at all the good reviews about the place, and it definitely was a great experience. Everyone came here with absolutely love the food, I really enjoyed the desert. The honey butter chips and the manila ice cream was just an amazing mix and honestly kind of taste like crème brûlée. The restaurant wasn't very large but the interior is very nicely decorated, and it was spacious enough to have a great time with friends. The service here was also very very good, Our waiter was super friendly and very on top of everything. I would definitely recommend for people to try the spot as the food was delicious, however it is a little pricey and I wasn't very full when leaving.",0
12047,"Title: Fresh and Comfortable Lunch Spot

I stopped by this restaurant around noon for lunch and was pleasantly surprised by the calm atmosphere and cleanliness of the place. The seating was notably comfortable, and the lunchtime menu offered a good selection of bowls. I chose the Ahi Tuna bowl, which promised a tempting mix of favorites like Kani and Edamame, and it did not disappoint. The ingredients were fresh, and the tuna was delightfully tender. I'd asked for rice instead of salad, and even though there was a mix-up and it came with salad, the dish was still enjoyable. Accompanied by a choice of Miso soup or salad, I was glad to have picked the soup especially given the mix-up. The portion size was perfect—not too filling but satisfying. Prices were reasonable, and the sushi rolls my coworker had also looked tempting. I'm already planning a return visit this week. If you're in the area and a fan of this cuisine, I'd recommend giving this spot a try for a quality meal at a fair price.",1
13921,"If you're a spicy ramen fan, you'll definitely want to check out this little ramen shop. Karakatta mainly specializes in spicy ramen. There are four options to choose: spicy ginger stamina, butter-miso, Taka's shoyu, and then spicy veggie curry. Spiciness can be tailored from mild to very spicy. There are also appetizers, like karaage and gyoza, but to keep things lighter, we opted just the spicy cucumber. I ordered the Spicy Ginger Stamina and my bf had the regular Tonkotsu with added spice. I liked the spicy ginger, but I didn't find it particularly outstanding. We ordered very spicy for both, but we could have upped it a notch. If we compare karakatta to Mr. Taka, which is their sister restaurant, I'd probably pick the latter. If you want spicy, definitely don't shy from asking for the highest scale. I appreciate the scaling option though. The broth is a flavorful chicken broth that feels somehow lighter perhaps because of the ginger infusion. The ramen is a nice wavy flat noodle. I didn't care for the pork belly, and it didn't seem like the highlight. The half boiled egg was excellent and perfectly made.The spicy ginger was not as rich and spicy as I was anticipating, but it doesn't shun me from wanting to return and try their other ramens. I particularly love Mr. Taka, and seeing them open another ramen spot makes me very happy. I just definitely won't shy from the spice scale, and I'm definitely interested in their other broth/toppings options. In terms of space, it's pretty tight. There's a small counter and some tables. We had no trouble getting a seat, but they also had no trouble filling out every seat in the restaurant. Considering it's a pretty fast sit down meal, I wouldn't worry too much  about long waits if the place is full.",0
10155,"The entry to Narcissa is the center middle behind a staffer and wedged between the two open bars up front. You walk in and there's another staffer who checks you in and sends you to the table or bar or outside. The server was from New Zealand and her humoring our guessing was appreciated. Dining space included an outdoor section or sitting inside with big open windows. Bathrooms are downstairs in a separate section (shared amongst the hotel and other bar).For the small plates:- the Parker house rolls were ok, though one of the only places I've been to lately where you are charged for rolls, this would've been more appropriately simply offered complimentary to every table- the Hen of the Woods was ok, but expensive for what I make in a huge batch at home- the smoky Japanese Sweet Potato was good if you like sweet potatoes (we make these at home frequently though not smoky) - scallop crudo was tasty and clean, no grit and a lighter flavor (not much salt)- the puntarelle is a chicory-like plant that was interesting and reminded me of a small plate of sauteed bok choy with boquerones and creme on it- grilled octopus was ok, though more char than I prefer- the stracciatella and cool mint was a wonderful almost burrata that included bread and was very goodWe had for the large plates to share:- roasted cauliflower - it's a cauliflower....good for those who love it, and vegetarians, but not exciting for me- crackling Porchetta - delicious, crispy outside and savory, sweet and soft pork inside. Definitely have to be back for this again.Dessert:- Apple Pie was tasty and people enjoyed the gouda ice cream, too- Chocolate Tart - wasn't particularly notable, but did enjoy the caramelized bananaThe Porchetta, stracciatella and crudo saved this from being consigned into a two star meal - the other dishes I didn't find particularly striking as I felt I've made better, or didn't fit my taste, but my fellow diners (some of whom were vegetarians) did enjoy it, and so if you are a vegetarian, there are a lot of options here you can enjoy.",0
15515,"I recently dined at a solid restaurant where it was apparent that the noodles were made in-house. Although they were a bit too al dente for my taste, the flavors were outstanding. The appetizers were equally delicious, and the service was pleasant. Would recommend for anyone looking for freshly made pasta with great taste.",1
10662,"Looks like we found a hidden spanish food place. It was packed with so many people so we can tell how their food is. This place has around 20-30 shops inside including sandwiches, barbecue, coffee, churros and a lot more. I was with my husband and we could not try food from here as it was very very crowded but we stood in line for churros place for about 10 mins and it came out the best dessert ever. We got 6 churros with hot chocolate sauce, who does not like churro(:D) and with chocolate sauce it was perfect. the chocolate was hot, was not very sweet and almost tasted like thick dark chocolate. I wish I could have this dish everyday. It was so good. All the churros were frying in front of us and were serving fresh. They also have savory churros with a sprinkle of their own spice mix.Its a must visit place ignoring the rush inside.",0
12693,"Had such high hopes for this place, what a waste. First off, and I mean no offense by this, but this specific location of Wolfgang's looks like a sports bar and not even a remotely fancy one at that (let's pretend there are fancy sports bars for a second). Second, the service was truly subpar. If I have to show my hand to get your attention every time in a very small restaurant, there's a problem. Third, the food. Everything was just terribly mediocre.  Whether it was the flavorless salad, the shrimp that didn't taste fresh, or the steak that was most definitely not medium rare (see picture attached for reference), everything completely missed the mark. I would've given it two stars if the price was remotely justified but unfortunately it wasn't. Wolfgang's was really disappointing but luckily there's no dearth of amazing steakhouses in NYC.",0

20044,"I came here prior to the UFC Fights at MSG to meet my aunt and uncle. It was pretty convenient that this restaurant is located to the side of the MSG entrance, so we were able to enter right after dinner. The bread basket offered a nice variety of types of breads, and while there were a few assorted specials available to choose from, I could not resist getting the seared tuna for dinner. The restaurant is dimly lit, and even though it was pretty busy, we were able to easily hear everyone around the table. My tuna came perfectly cooked on a bed of spinach. I was really quite pleased. If you'd like to stop at a restaurant on the pricier side while visiting MSG, I would recommend giving this one a try!",0

The ambiance is lively yet comfortably non-hectic, ideal for a girls' get-together, a meal with your mom, or a casual bite with colleagues. Its prime location adjacent to Grand Central makes it an easy recommendation for anyone in the city. Don't miss out on this delightful experience!",1

They were pretty busy but we were starved so when the option of sitting by the bar became available we jumped on it. The bartender was very nice and we were able to get the best service at the bar.I had their cornbread waffle which is soooo good! It's served with a whipped honey butter that's not too sweet but perfect with the waffle. I also had their chicken parsley sausages which were good and their hash, buttered with foie gras, which just might put duck fat to shame.Everything was great. I thoroughly enjoyed the food and was happy that we decided to grab a bite before going back home. I definitely want to come back soon. They're only about a 15 minute drive from my house so it's doable.",0

I visited the restaurant on a Tuesday evening. With a small crowd, the staff were attentive, ensuring our food was delivered almost instantly—almost magically quick, hot, and tasty.

The experience was positive overall, but the ravioli could have been better.",1
20524,Came here with two girlfriends for dinner and drinks. The cocktails were all unique and delicious! They had so many to choose from as well. We ordered the pulled chicken and BLT sandwiches which were a spin off the originals. The flavors were really yummy! The service was pretty slow but our waiter was friendly and gave good recommendations. We didn't mind since we weren't in any rush. This would definitely be a fun date spot in the East Village. It's laid back but has swanky cocktails which is the perfect combo!,0
14573,"Dian Kitchen is an unassuming noodle shop in East Village offering authentic Yunnanese cuisine. To pull the obligatory card, my friend whose family is from Yunnan brought us here and vouched for it, and I'm quite glad she did.It's a small counter service operation offering a similarly slim menu of rice noodles and small plates. The mixian here is spaghetti sized, soft, and milky white, offered both cold and in broth.I went for the kunming tender beef rice noodle ($14), a hefty bowl of noodles with a flavorful broth and a hint of spice. The beef is actually pretty tender. The abundance of fresh chives, cilantro and mint was a highlight, and the lurking pickled vegetables added an element of surprise. I also tried a bit of the dong-chuan noodles and little pot rice noodles-- really tasty minced pork. The broth on the little pot is unreal; I'd go for that one next time.An unexpected highlight was the mu-gua shui ($3.50), a traditional and refreshing beverage-cum-dessert that I don't think I've seen pop up on any other Yunnanese spots' menus (Little Tong, South of the Clouds). A mixture of papaya seed jelly and sesame seeds in a cold brown-sugar-based liquid, it has an acquired texture at first brush but becomes addictive. Tastes a bit like sweet tea without the tea.Staff is friendly and food comes out quick. The space is cozy and casual. A great pick for lunch or a casual weeknight dinner.",0

We had to split our party up to be seated sooner, and the hostess was extremely accommodating of our requests, and communicated with us efficiently about the process. The menu here is large, and contains a high amount of classic Chinese dishes that most people will be familiar with, including shu mai, various types of dim sum, sesame pancake, etc. However, there are not too many vegetarian/vegan options. The prices are decent, and the food is excellently cooked and presented. I loved each dish that we ordered, with nothing really standing out over any other dish. The ambience is modern and sophisticated. Would highly recommend, and look forward to returning.",0

There's also some standing room to eat as well. It's a small kitchen but you can see them making the noodles from hand. I ordered the spicy cumin lamb ripped noodles (N1 - $11.21) which is one of their most popular dishes. Oh my goodness it was so good! The noodles are chewy, the lamb is good, the cabbage adds a crunchy and cooling effect to the spiciness, and of course the cumin is great. Make sure you have something to wash the spice down because I thought it was pretty spicy.If you didn't know, cumin is one of my favorite spices. And Xi'an just took my love for cumin to another level.",0
12554,"Title: Unique Solo Dining Experience at a Times Square Ramen Spot

I recently tried a solo dining ramen restaurant in the heart of Times Square—an interesting concept more commonly seen in Japan. Although it seems impractical for the usual group-dining scene in New York, my friend and I managed to snag seats rather quickly for a Friday lunch.

The ordering process is quirky, involving waiting in various spots as directed by the staff, which came off a bit excessive. You fetch your own drink and choose from a set menu or customize your bowl. A recommended set, complete with a modest mix of vegetables, an egg, and a few slices of meat, will set you back $24, or start from $19 for a custom bowl.

After ordering at the press of a button, we received our meals promptly. The ramen portions were standard but felt meager for the price point. The broth was tasty, yet it's debatable whether it justified the $24 charge. However, it's worth noting the restaurant operates on a no-tipping policy, which might make the price slightly more reasonable.

Paying involved a novel approach of taking a wooden board with our seat number to the front. Despite the experience being unique, the value proposition fell short for me. It's unlikely I'll return, as I favor other ramen joints that offer more substantial servings under $20.",1

Service was top-notch, with our attentive waiter who navigated a small birthday cake hiccup with finesse, ensuring complete comfort for our party.

The ambience on the rooftop added to the allure, adorned with floral arrangements across the ceiling – an enchanting setup that's a must-visit during the chillier seasons.

After hearing the buzz on Yelp, I ventured into this spot anticipating a meal that would match the online acclaim. Unfortunately, my experience was a mixed bag. I opted for the breaded chicken paired with rice and fries, expecting a bit of culinary flair, but what I got was rather ordinary. While the chicken was satisfactory, the plain rice and standard fries left me searching for the flavor I had hoped would define my meal.

The true highlight was the $4 sangria special, a delightful concoction, well-balanced and brimming with fruity notes – potent enough that one glass was ample. Despite the lackluster food, I found the sangria and the restaurant's affordability in NYC compelling reasons to consider a revisit. Perhaps another dish might rise to the occasion.",1

15436,"Title: Superb Cuisine Marred by Poor Service

I recently had the opportunity to dine at this establishment during a conference dinner. The experience was meant to be impeccable given it was an all-inclusive event. I'd love to award this venue a perfect score based on its culinary offerings alone—the salad bar was fresh and varied, the assortment of meats perfectly cooked, the wine selection exquisite, and the desserts truly indulgent. The atmosphere matched the quality of the food: elegant and inviting.

However, the evening was significantly dampened by the behavior of one server. His service—or lack thereof—was shocking and frankly unacceptable. As a smaller individual, I am often overlooked, but this server took it to a new level by not just ignoring me, but blatantly disregarding my requests when I addressed him directly. It was an uncomfortable situation that left me questioning whether his motivations were based on racism, sexism, or simply an unwarranted disdainful attitude.

This kind of service is a disservice to the otherwise wonderful staff and establishment. Regrettably, I did not catch his name to inform management directly, but I sincerely hope this feedback prompts a much-needed conversation about respect and customer service. A single server's behavior can tarnish the reputation of an otherwise excellent dining experience.",1
248,"Title: Mixed Experiences with Mediterranean Snacks

We revisited the restaurant for a light snack at 12:30 pm and had a subpar experience with the dips. The eggplant dip had an off-putting fizzy taste that led to all four of us deciding to send it back — certainly not the quality we expected. The tzatziki was overwhelmed with cream cheese, straying from the traditional tangy yogurt flavor I anticipated. The garlic and salmon dip was the redeeming selection, offering a fairly enjoyable contrast to the others.

Our hopes to rebound with the main dishes were only marginally met. The octopus was excessively oily, which detracted from its flavor. The grilled calamari didn’t fare much better, proving to be quite bland and in need of more seasoning.

On a positive note, service was a highlight. Our waitress was cordial, and the celebratory touch of bringing a piece of cake with a firecracker for my birthday was a delightful surprise. Despite this, the culinary missteps were notable.",1
10619,"I miss all of the great little Filipino turo turo places that were in midtown east and now sadly all gone. Thankfully this little gem opened up in the food hall adjacent to grand central so it's my saving grace when I'm having a crave day! Traditional flavors and some traditional style dishes but in their own take. The point of Filipino adobo is not only just about the protein braised in the vinegar- soy-garlic marinade but the actual broth that is spooned and eaten together with copious amounts of rice! Their chicken adobo is very good but too dry without the broth in tow, although they offer yummy adobo rice, it's not the same. Their lumpia Shanghai is spot on with a nicely seasoned filling with a beautiful crunchy fried wrapped exterior and love that they serve Filipino breakfast all day and garlic fried rice is on the menu all day too!

112,"Title: Characterful Pub with Underwhelming Fare by the WTC

During a recent stay at a neighboring hotel, we decided to give the nearby pub a try. Touted for its unique character, reminiscent of a set from a television show, the place certainly has a divey charm that might appeal to regulars, but as out-of-towners, we found it rather underwhelming.

The pub stands across from the World Trade Towers, adding a touch of historical significance to its location. However, the dining experience did not live up to this notable backdrop. We ordered burgers, which were decent in size but disappointingly bland in flavor.

On the upside, the Long Island Iced Tea I had was well-crafted. But overall, even as the pub exudes a certain 'character,' the culinary offerings left much to be desired. Not long after finishing our meal, we decided to call it a night and venture elsewhere.",1
14601,"Agern was the choice of restaurant for my brother's last night in New York. We made a reservation a couple of weeks before the day, and the reservation was very easily made online. We were seated immediately after coming in, and taken care of in a timely manner. We were brought complimentary bread before our food, which was served warm and fresh, with whipped butter. Our food was brought out quickly after we'd ordered. I had the bitter salad, which was as the name described, bitter. It came with shavings of Parmesan cheese, and was refreshingly tasty. My brother had the sunchokes, a vegetable or berry that I'd never heard of previously, while my husband had the forono beets. We all tasted each other's dishes, and agreed that all were good. For mains, I ordered the lobster, while my brother had the Atlantic cod, and my husband had the pork belly. Each dish was very different in terms of taste. The Atlantic cod was the lightest of the three, while the lobster was the heaviest, and the pork belly was in between the two. The lobster was decadent, with pieces of it encased in a flaky pastry, and served in a creamy, buttery bisque. The piece of lobster next to it was also delicious. My husband's pork belly was delicious and tender. I don't usually like to eat pork, but I would have eaten all of this. For dessert, the three of us shared the skyr. It was paired with some gelato, and not in the usual yoghurt form, but it wasn't bad. It wasn't a dessert that I would order if I came here again though. We ordered from the a la carte menu, so the dinner wasn't too much more than a standard New York restaurant. Ambience and service were lovely throughout the meal. Would recommend as one of the more affordable Michelin star restaurants in NY.",0

As much as I savored the dish, I feel the need to deduct one star for the unexpected charge.

16312,"Title: A Union Square Gem for Falafel Fans

I often visit a charming spot in Union Square on my work breaks, and it never disappoints. The brisk walk sets the stage for what is always a delightful meal. Their Jalapeno falafel wrapped in whole wheat bread, priced at a very reasonable $8, is my go-to choice. Not only is it wallet-friendly for the city, but it's also incredibly satisfying.

I appreciate the option to customize my meal with fresh vegetable toppings—don't miss out on the broccoli—and the tahini sauce is the perfect finish, both served in separate containers for convenience. Despite sometimes facing a long line, the efficient staff ensure that it moves swiftly, so you're never waiting long.

The hospitable service and the filling, tasty food make this place a no-brainer for anyone in the area. I can't recommend it enough for a quick, delicious, and budget-friendly meal.",1
10000,"Title: A Gem That Never Sleeps

I've been a patron of this culinary oasis for years, and it never ceases to amaze me. Open 24/7, it's the perfect spot for any meal, anytime. I celebrated a birthday brunch here a while back and it left a lasting impression, so much so that I returned recently for a late-night dinner date. 

Our experience was top-notch from the get-go, with no wait time and attentive service. The menu presented a delightful dilemma with its array of tempting options. We settled on the steak with greens and mash – a decision that proved to be beyond satisfactory. It was flawlessly cooked and seasoned to perfection. The 'Mac Attack' side dish also stood out as a not-to-be-missed item.

In short, this place has solidified its spot on my go-to list for dining out. I will surely be back sooner rather than later, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for an exceptional dining experience at any hour.",1
1356,"V and I mainly came for the views and the outdoor seating area. The night we came for our dinner reservations was a windy day, so we took a few photos with the illuminating face and headed back inside for our meal. We were seated close to the rooftop doors, which meant that we could not escape from the coldness! V asked if they could close the doors... and we were told they could not. Is there some sort of safety hazard if the doors remain closed?! They need to rethink this if they want to remain open. We started off with a couple of cocktails and raw oysters. The drinks arrived well after we ordered them. I kept thinking, how long does it take to make a drink?! The restaurant wasn't fully packed either. On a bright note, I enjoyed the fresh oysters. My main course was the roasted chicken. The sauce was too salty for my liking. V ordered the halibut which came with a few tortillas. I'm not a huge fan of fish but it was a good twist to Mexican food. If I'm ever in the area again, I'll probably skip Electric Lemon. Expensive meal, service was mediocre, and food was just average.",0
14307,"Good for a taco fix but the food is frankly average. They do not carry Pico de Gallo or sour cream in house, and the burritos and tortas are only available on the seamless menu. In person, the space is big and bright and beautiful. The wait staff was also average - nothing to complain about but nothing impressive either. The fish taco comes with ~5 ounces of fish in it - it's huge! The quesadilla doesn't have a lot of cheese in it and is served open face in store. On seamless they fold it. It was greasy and drippy and didn't taste great. I've had their burrito on seamless before and it's pretty good but definitely heavy/meaty. Not your average burrito, and nothing light like pico de gallo to balance it out.The juices are delicious - highly recommend them! We had the pineapple ginger and mint juice which was really fresh and tasty. It had an almost smoothie-like consistency.",0

19674,"This was a wonderful experience for my friend's birthday brunch. The staff was accommodating: we were running late and had to move the reservation back 30 mins and there were 11 of us. Not a problem! The interior is very pleasant - everyone commented on the mural on the back wall. Most of the party had some form of Eggs Benedict (with salmon, ham, etc.) I had the Croque Madame, which was absolutely delicious! Two friends ordered mimosas and they were quite strong! Prices were very reasonable for the good amount of food and drinks we ordered. Only gripe is the cash-only policy but their great service and food make up for it. Plus there's an ATM inside!",0
16406,"I have to say, having relatives in Malaysia and Singapore definitely has created cravings for the motherland foods.  I was super excited to find more SE Asian foods, specifically these types of foods like nasi lemak at Laut.  The two things we tried were the following:Nasi Lemak: coconut rice with sambal chili anchoviesPROS- good quantity, definitely shareable if you and your party get other dishes.- filling if it's just for a solo eater (medium, not big eater)- served with curry chicken (standard, but possibly also with beef dry curry at some other places): good flavor, not overly spicy- good balance of the four different kinds of components to the dish (anchovies, chicken, rice, cucumbers, egg)- generous portion of the anchovies (this is my favorite part, mostly because of the roasted peanuts mixed inside)CONS- chicken was overcooked.  I don't like mushy chicken.  It wasn't bad, just as if it was boiled in the curry a little too long.Satay Tofu: Fried tofu triangles stuffed with bean sprouts and served with a satay peanut sauce.PROS:- good flavor: peanut sauce was not overly sweetCONS:- crappy quantity.  You can just see in the pictures for themselves - small pieces of tofu, only shareable with maybe one other person. It was great to satisfy the craving, but I don't think I would come back here again, especially knowing a few other Malaysian places in the city.  If you're starving AND craving Malaysian AND it's within the vicinity then sure, by all means, knock yourself out.  Always worth a try - one other review said it was hit or miss but there are so many restaurants in NYC to ""try"" that I don't know if I would come back here for another go round.  Still worth trying if you haven't been on your own accord!",0
17846,"Title: Pricey but Flavorful Lunch Spot

I'm settling on a 3-star rating for this establishment, primarily because it feels overpriced for a daily lunch option. However, the saving grace is that the flavors are on point, and the portion sizes are generous. I particularly enjoy the Mexican bowl and the African bowl, the latter thanks to its delightful Spicy Mango curry sauce. Vegetarians and vegans will be pleased with the variety of choices available, and the standard inclusion of hummus and falafel with each bowl or pita is a welcome touch. Despite its culinary strengths, I do wish the restaurant would consider lowering its prices to be more accessible for regular visits.",1
12642,"Title: A Festive Feast with a Few Ups and Downs

I ventured into this restaurant on Christmas Eve, an occasion that calls for a special culinary experience. The service was commendable—a beacon of hospitality that truly made our celebration feel more joyous.

Our foray into the starters was a delightful surprise; the octopus appetizer was a testament to the chef's prowess, striking a perfect balance in texture and taste. The scallops followed suit, seared to perfection, leaving my palate thoroughly satisfied.

However, the foie gras and duck ravioli, a dish surrounded by much fanfare, sadly fell short of my high expectations. While the richness and smoothness were undeniable, and the foie gras flavor was present, the dish could not live up to the hype it had accumulated. 

The saving grace of the meal was the lemon dessert - an explosion of flavors that danced on the tongue. The combination of moist cake and a sorbet that packed an impressive citrus punch was nothing short of extraordinary. I found myself longing for more of this zesty indulgence.

The prices are on the steeper side, but that's a small premium for the overall quality and ambiance of such an establishment. Though the ravioli won't see a repeat order from me, I am intrigued enough by the rest of the menu to consider a return visit.",1
13004,"First time trying empanadas and I'm so mad to find out about this place so late! They are also open 24/7!! They have an open bar at the back! Highly recommend the guacamole tapas! $11.50 but the portion is worth it! It is served with warm plantain chips. I think this is the perfect combo.Each empanada is $3.99. The wheat empanadas we tried were (order of my fav to least fav):- eggplant parmesan: tomato, oregano, basil, red wine, Parmesan, Mozzarella.- cheesesteak: steak, mozzarella, red pepper, onion- Viagra: tiger shrimp, crab meat- reggaeton: pork, sofrito seasoned yellow rice,  pigeon peasThese come with a green sauce that I absolutely love. I need the recipe for this sauce! The empanadas will take some time to come out though. Great for on the go as well! I came back next day and got the cheesesteak and eggplant Parmesan empanadas.",0
20367,"Title: A Tale of Two Experiences at Vezzo

I've been ordering Vezzo's thin-crust pizza for office lunches over the years, and it's consistently delightful – a definite crowd-pleaser. Pickup is a breeze, given its convenient location.

Recently, I dined in for a weekend lunch and my advice is to stick with what they do best: pizza. Service lacked promptness, and the salad was underwhelming – just greens mingled with what seemed like pizza toppings, lacking the freshness I'd hoped for. However, the pizza maintained its high standard – reliably delicious as always. Stick to the pizza at Vezzo, and you'll leave content.",1
16778,"I recently dined at this restaurant and must say I was thoroughly impressed, far more so than during my visit to their Flatiron location. The atmosphere was relaxed, devoid of any feeling of being rushed, which greatly enhanced the dining experience. To my delight, there was a mere 10-minute wait for a table on a weekend lunch—a rarity indeed!

My boyfriend and I opted for the ""Trust Me"" menu, and it truly lived up to its name. Each dish was remarkable, and the timing between courses was impeccable, a notable improvement from the other branch. This place has earned its spot on my list of favorites, and I am already looking forward to our next visit.",1
20433,"Spicy is their thing! I am usually not a fan but there were different degrees of spiciness that I was able to find dishes that all could enjoy.  Note: they occupy the space formerly Flaming Kitchen and the signs have still not been taken down. The mod decor and garden like green space really makes the dining area bright and calming. The lights help as well to create that ambiance. Booths are great for groups and the tables are long, perfect for their dishes and unique plating.My family and I came on a Saturday evening, at about 6pm. Reservations were necessary to hold a spot given our group size.  The place was almost at full capacity when we arrived (first floor). Before we were done for the evening, we noticed that they had to open up the second floor dining area as it was eventually packed. The manager Angus, was super friendly and greeted us with a warm smile and suggestions of what to try. My sister had been here before so she was the one doing most of the ordering.My only comment about the food - first is the portion sizes. Some dishes were just not as expected. Some were regular sized entrees and other dishes were smaller bistro type sizes. You couldn't tell from ordering until the food arrived, to see if it was enough. The photos on the menu were not helpful since they are all stock photos but seeing other guests ordering near us, was helpful.We ordered everything to share and for the most part, it worked out.  Until we got to the spice level. If you're a fan of spices and cajun seasoning, food with heat; then this is the place for you. Growing up on Cantonese cuisine, this was a bit too much for me but I still will give 4 stars on the cuisine presented and the attentive service overall.The Food:- Dan Dan noodles, great for sharing but too spicy for me. Hubby liked it and finished it as we could've handle the heat.- Surf clams (aka artic red clams) were served skewer style resting in a bowl of sauce. The plating did nothing for this dish and the clams were too small. Skip!- Stir fry cauliflower, we all enjoyed this dish. Red peppers spotted here and there for color effect but note it's not vegetarian friendly. This dish has pork belly and skin stir fried in as well. Great flavors but know it's not 100% vegetarian.- orange chicken for the non spicy eaters. The sauce was good, sticky and a hint of sweet and sour. The red peppers were for garnish and texture. Each piece was covered in batter and fork tender. Not dry so I'd recommend this.- Seafood boil, which is the reason to come here in the first place! There are many options to choose from on the menu and you can customize to a point where I told the manager about my shrimp allergy so he was willing to substitute it out. The boil we chose had crab legs, one whole lobster, potatoes and corn, and a bunch of crawfish. Not complaining but I noticed a few crawfish heads and no bodies so I felt a little jipped of paying for something that I didn't have. Just saying.- scallion Pancakes, really good. Fried perfectly and not greasy. Kids loved it and dogged it. I would recommend this for sure.- lamb chops, minimum order is 4 pcs.  Otherwise, you may order per person above the minimum.  Skip this dish...the lamb was very dry and the presentation of spices were great but it didn't translate to the food.- house sake (cold) for me and orange juice for the kids. The glassware it's served in levels up the dining experience. Canned sodas were available as well.- Yelp check in offer, free soft drink... Check your bill though, I ended up getting charged for it! Dang it.Anyway, come here for the boil and the seafood.  Great for groups.  I'll be more mindful to come w/ people who like spicy or cajun.  This was a miss for my crew but a hit for everyone else.",0
20928,"this is my new favorite rice roll shop! Chinatown has been in need of a cheap & delicious, solely rice roll shop & it has finally been delivered. You can't beat the quality or the price. $2.50 for a small rice roll or $3.50 for a large. I got the small shrimp with corn for an extra $0.50 which was plenty filling as a snack for me. The shrimp was cooked well & tasty & they offer sweet sauce or peanut sauce to top as well as soy & sriracha on the table. So good, definitely recommend (a huge slap in the face better than Joe's Steam rice rolls on St. Marks that tries to charge you $9+ for a lesser product). Definitely recommend coming here, they only have two small tables so plan to take it to go or eat it in store really quick.",0

Don't be fooled by the name while there are plenty of pork dishes their are numerous dishes for non pork eaters. I will say their fish, shrimp and crab dishes were great. I was able to sample some great dishes and a few appetizers. The brussel sprouts were amazing. They were seasoned very well and had me yearning for more. My overall experience at Pig Heaven was great. For our large party of at least ten the food came out fairly quick and never cold  which is great and we were never left wondering when was the food coming out. The location is not huge but not tiny They have a nice size bar and the place is decorated with pigs. All kinds of pigs. The waitress also told us that the most popular dish is the ribs so if your into ribs definitely try it. Pig Heaven isn't to far from the Lexington ave train 4,5 and 6",0

First time around I gave the Tequeños a try aka cheese sticks pretty good nice amount of cheese good w the pink dipping sauce.

Next time I gave the Cachapa a try this was very good nice hint of sweetness to the corn great tasting cheese comes w a cheese type dipping sauce, very good addition. Tried the Tequeños again this time wasn't as pleased since they were different more fried than before but better tasting dipping sauce the green garlic one. On the arepa gave the Midtown a try, this is Sol arepa , short Rib & de Mano cheese nice tasting combo. Also tried the Polar beer, not bad better if it were colder.

11685,"Title: Charming Spot for Tapas and Tunes

I recently visited a darling little restaurant I stumbled upon on Yelp, and it certainly didn't disappoint. My friend and I arrived on a Friday afternoon around 4pm to find the place relatively empty, giving us the perfect ambiance for catching up. The interior was charming, ideal for a leisurely meet-up.

As the evening progressed, the establishment began to fill, and the background chatter increased, but it stayed at a pleasant hum. To our surprise, there was live jazz. While enjoyable, it seemed slightly out of place given the restaurant's overall vibe.

On to the food: we shared a selection of tapas—flavorful arepas, crispy tostones, and heavenly tequeños that were so soft, they were pillow-esque. Accompanied by $6 happy hour wine that was as delightful to the palate as it was to the wallet, the culinary experience was a hit.

I'll definitely return to explore more of their offerings, as the taste and value have left a lasting impression. Highly recommend for a casual yet refined outing!",1
10932,"Title: Flavor Hits and Misses at a Cozy Spot

I found myself at this Korean eatery on a surprisingly quiet Saturday night, a relief from the usual city bustle. My dining companion and I dove into the menu, selecting the Korean fried chicken in both spicy and original flavors, along with tteokbokki and pork belly. The chicken was a standout, crispy on the outside and succulent inside, and the pork belly was equally impressive, especially paired with the fervent dance of kimchi on the hot plate.

However, the tteokbokki fell flat. Topped with decent katsu, the dish was undermined by a sauce too sweet and timid in spice, a stark contrast to the boldness expected from Korean cuisine. Moreover, the sauce's consistency was disappointingly thin, and the rice cakes suffered from uneven preparation.

While the tteokbokki was a letdown, I left with my cravings for Korean comfort food largely satisfied and intrigue to explore beyond that one disappointing dish. The return journey is on my horizon, but next time, the tteokbokki won't make the cut on my order.",1
12424,"I sat in the bar area here with my friends after my reservation at L'Artusi was cancelled on my birthday. I was able to make a reservation easily a few hours before.I was excited to sit in the bar and have a small bite to eat after hearing amazing things about the food here but I'm afraid my expectations may I have been too high as I only found the food to be good, not excellent. I got the pasta which was rich and decedent but seemed to lack a certain depth to it. The service was also a bit strange - my friends had planned a surprise birthday dessert for me and the waiter mistakenly came to me twice about it. They also did not put a birthday candle on the dessert initially despite putting one on the dessert on the table next to us.I suppose this is one of those restaurants that you need to go to the main restaurant and get the full course to enjoy. I don't believe I'll be back to the bar after this experience.",0
10475,"I visited this restaurant with a friend for lunch and was disappointed with the experience. Despite the establishment being nearly empty, the service was notably poor. My soup arrived promptly, but my entree was delayed, arriving only after my friend was nearly done with her meal. Additionally, the pesto pasta I ordered lacked flavor, tasting merely of salt and failing to satisfy. Given the subpar food and service, I have no intention of returning.",1
11525,"**Ajisen Ramen - Chinatown: A Delightful Experience**

Having frequented Ajisen Ramen in Hong Kong, my recent visit to their Chinatown location was a consistent delight. Despite the bustling Saturday night crowd, the four of us were seated immediately — a pleasant surprise.

We commenced with the Japanese fried chicken, which stood out not just for its savory taste but also for its generous portion, making it an ideal starter for sharing. For the main course, we gravitated towards the house specialties — the Ajisen ramen and its deluxe counterpart, the latter boasting succulent pork tender rib. Both versions were met with applause from our table; the soup base was rich and well-seasoned, the noodles cooked to just the right firmness, and the chashu (pork slices) were delightfully tender.

A bonus tip for fellow diners: a check-in on Yelp rewards you with a complimentary mochi, albeit limited to one per table. The efficient service complemented the quality food, ensuring our dining experience was both smooth and satisfying.

Ajisen Ramen in Chinatown has solidified itself as my go-to spot for ramen cravings. Anticipate my return for another warm bowl of their signature comfort.",1
3558,"Overall, pretty average. I was able to try several dishes including the pork and chive dumplings, fried buns, yellow noodles w/ peanut sauce, roast duck and noodle soup. The fried pork and chive dumplings were the best out of the lot but that is not saying much. Fried buns were too doughy, barely any peanut sauce on the noodles and the soup broth had no depth of flavor. I would say if you are really craving some cheap fried dumplings and you are in the area, this place is fine in a pinch. However, overall I would say its a skip.",0
13588,The noodles are so chewy and springy! It's like chewing on abalone or bubble gum in your mouth. I opted for the shrimp and chicken knife cut noodles. The noodles were wider and larger which have more texture to chew through. I absolutely loved it! The dish over was well seasoned but they give you a bunch of condiments at your table to flavor the dish to your liking. The place is small and tight inside. They also only accept cash only so come prepared!,0
11379,"Title: A Delectable Evening at Crispo

Last evening at Crispo was an exquisite experience. The service was impeccable, matching their exceptional food offerings. With an impressive wine list, the evening started on a high note.

For starters, the bone marrow with escargot topping was a standout dish, setting the stage for the main course. The pastas—an iconic carbonara and the luxurious black truffle ravioli—were, without a doubt, some of the finest in New York City. The shared main courses of steak and branzino were prepared to perfection, with every bite more delicious than the last.

The ambiance of Crispo adds to its charm, featuring a glass roof that creates an enchanting garden-like dining experience under the night sky.

Crispo comes highly recommended for anyone in search of a top-tier dining experience with both food and atmosphere that delight in every aspect.",1
18014,"We came here with friends and were disappointed and thought it was over-hyped.  We had a reservation but still had to wait 15 minutes for our table.  It is ""Asian American"" food.  The restaurant is dimly lit and small.  The pork dish did not taste like pork.  Everything was just ok.  I ordered the wagyu beef.  The wagyu beef came with one piece of broccolini... Really one piece - couldn't throw a few more pieces on there?  The waitress really pressured us to order lots of appetizers and sides which we did not do.  Most of the appetizers also were not shareable for 4 people only for 2.  Pricing was high and food wasn't special.",0
1072,"I recently ordered from a local restaurant and my experience was largely disappointing. On a positive note, the bread provided was fresh and my meal arrived piping hot – perhaps a testament to their microwave prowess. However, the spaghetti sauce had the unmistakable taste of being sourced straight from a can, lacking any homemade charm. The pappardelle was overdone to the point of mushiness and so flavorless that I was thankful for the salt and pepper in the utensil packet.

To add to the letdown, there was a glaring issue with the delivery. Instead of receiving the broccolo as described on the menu – broccoli rabe sautéed in garlic and olive oil – I was given plain broccoli without any prior notification or consent. This practice of substituting items in delivery orders without customer approval is unacceptable and suggests a lack of respect for their patrons who might not be in proximity to address these issues directly. Overall, my dining experience was underwhelming and I would hesitate to order from here again.",1
12006,"Title: A Charming Birthday Dinner with Scene and Taste

I recently celebrated an early birthday dinner at this much-talked-about restaurant, gifted by a generous coworker. The buzz around its decor and the chef’s pedigree, having apprenticed under the legendary Joel Robuchon, had piqued my curiosity.

The atmosphere on arrival was vibrant and sceney, even on a Wednesday evening, which added a layer of entertainment to the experience. We dived into a well-curated menu, starting with a fresh lettuce salad, moving on to a refreshing melon burrata, followed by perfectly cooked fish and chicken mains, and culminating in a rich dark chocolate caramel dessert. While no single dish tipped the scales to extraordinary, each was executed with skill, making our meal a delight.

The service was as standout as the dishes, with staff demonstrating an impressive knowledge of the menu, ensuring our dining experience was seamless and felt personal.

Although my return isn't imminent, the restaurant left me with a feeling of satisfaction and a curiosity to explore their sister venue, Shun, with its French-Japanese fusion, located just upstairs.

Rating: 4/5 – For the service and ambiance, worth a visit for those seeking a special night out.",1
10957,I have visited their other location in midtown before. Always had a fun time there. We decided to check out this location and they had everything down. Our server was always helpful with suggestions and checking up on us to make sure we were having a great time. The steak was nicely cooked and we really enjoyed the thick bacon. In Times Square / theater district there may be many options but not many that are good. It's good to know you can count on this spot.,0
16763,"Lots of Chinatown restaurants are now overrun by tourists. They're crowded and the food is more American-Chinese than it is Chinese. Shanghai Asian Cuisine is no different. Our party of four came in at around 1:45 and the place was packed. The only thing that I kind of enjoyed was the crab soup dumplings. But the crab inside tasted more like dried shrimp. Still, an okay dumpling is still a good dumpling. We also ordered the pork buns (really oily), stir-fried rice cake (not bad), and spring rolls (not good). I don't think there's anything here that would make me want to come back.",0
18932,"Title: A Bowl Above Rest: The Ichiran Experience

If you're a ramen aficionado, you might have debated the merits of Ichiran versus Ippudo. Well, dare I say, Ichiran just might take the crown. Located amidst the bustling cityscape, spotting a line outside its doors is common, but on my visit, the queue was mercifully brief – a mere 10 minutes wait.

As custom dictates, Ichiran had us pre-order via a form while in line, which efficiently speeds up the seating process. On this particular day, we were pleasantly surprised with the offer of a complimentary extra bowl of ramen.

I opted for the ""Set,"" a delightful ensemble of green onions, kikurage mushrooms, a perfectly soft-boiled egg, generous slices of chashu pork, and seaweed. Yes, I indulged in the extra serving of noodles. Post-ordering from the privacy of my cozy booth, the broth arrived promptly. Each sip was a testament to balance – rich but not overwhelming, with the noodles exhibiting an ideal bite.

Contrary to the traditional quiet ambiance of Japanese ramen shops, the noise level here was higher, which somewhat detracted from the otherwise sensory-focused experience. Regardless, the individual booths provide a solitary haven for those wishing to concentrate on the culinary journey.

As I finished, the process of payment was seamless, handed a board to present to the cashier. Ichiran doesn’t beckon for long, reflective pauses post-meal, and while it may not be the venue for large gatherings, it's a perfect pit stop for a solo diner in need of a soul-warming feast.

Recommendation? Unreservedly. Ichiran is a must-visit for anyone seeking a taste of authentic ramen with a side of solitude.",1
10362,"A friend and I were looking for a nearby place to eat before a show at RCMH that is both nice and wouldn't break the bank.  Enter Danji, a Michelin-recommend modern Korean restaurant with a spice-forward and veggie-centric menu.  We made reservations for 6:30 and showed up right on time.  The hostess let us know that we had the option for a high top table, for which we were originally reserved, or move to a ""better"" regular height table with the understanding that we would have to vacate the table at 7:30.  I don't love being told by an establishment I am giving my business to that I am expected to leave at a specific time, but our show was at 8 so we were planning on leaving around the time they wanted us to, so we took the better table.Drinks were a hit and a miss.  My friend had a spicy margarita, which she liked, but my Pink G&T was not great.  It seems the tonic water was replaced with seltzer, and it was missing the citrus component.  Pomegranate arils made the drink ""pink"" but you couldn't taste it.The food, on the other hand, was delicious!  Their menu is split up according to plate size (small, medium, and large--for reference, a large is about the size of an average entree).  We shared the tofu w/ginger scallion dressing, garlic honey wings, and the bacon wet kimchi fried rice.  Every single dish was packed with flavor, and we polished everything off.  The tofu in particular was shockingly delicious.  Even my friend who isn't the biggest tofu fan, loved it.",0

10058,"Title: A Spirited Gem: American Whiskey Bar Review

American Whiskey stands out as a compelling haunt for whiskey enthusiasts seeking more than just an extensive selection. While its inventory may not be the largest around, it strikes a harmonious balance between variety, atmosphere, and fun—the trifecta for a return-worthy spot.

The ambiance hits the mark for comfort and relaxation, creating an ideal backdrop for both casual drinkers and connoisseurs alike. The engaging staff elevates the experience, readily diving into conversations that extend beyond the usual spiel, contributing to the bar's approachable vibe.

On my visit, while I didn’t delve into their food offerings, the whiskey flights were the heart of the experience. The opportunity to discuss the nuances of my tastings with a knowledgeable server, along with swapping stories of drinks and dives, cemented my appreciation for this establishment.

A word to the wise: watch your step on the staircase leading to the restrooms after indulging in their fine spirits—it feels like a descent into an underground cityscape.

In conclusion, American Whiskey has secured its place on my list of Manhattan must-visits. Its holistic approach to the whiskey bar scene guarantees I'll be stopping by whenever I'm in town.",1

The flavors were outstanding, with the perfect melding of prosciutto, fresh mozzarella, and arugula, all drizzled with a tangy balsamic vinaigrette, nestled in a fresh Italian hero bread. While they suggest it's enough for two, it's a challenge to contemplate sharing such a delight.

19108,"Title: A Birthday Feast to Remember at [Restaurant Name]

I recently celebrated a birthday at [Restaurant Name] and was left in awe of the exceptional service and scrumptious food. The meal kicked off with a crispy Indian flatbread (apologies for not recalling its exact name), which paired beautifully with an array of flavorful sauces.

The main course featured a trio of curries: a chicken curry, a fiery lamb vindaloo, and a delightful paneer dish, each ordered at a medium spice level—though the mediums felt quite mild, except for the lamb, which truly packed a punch. The accompanying rice was perfectly cooked, and the garlic naan was a standout, loaded with a generous helping of garlic that met my tastes superbly.

To our delight, the presumed owner surprised us with a complimentary pistachio ice cream for the birthday celebration—a thoughtful touch that rounded off the meal nicely. Both the service and food at [Restaurant Name] were top-notch, making for a thoroughly enjoyable dining experience. Many thanks for such a lovely evening!",1
1682,"Title: A Sudden Fall from Grace

I regret to report that a former favorite eatery of mine has plummeted in my estimation after a dreadful recent visit. Gone are the days of efficient service; the waiting system now seems disorganized and painfully slow. Despite arriving as a party of three, we languished for over an hour while duos and quartets were seated ahead of us, some who had arrived significantly later.

The host and bouncers displayed an unwelcoming attitude, and the puzzling refusal to accommodate three patrons at a four-seater remains a mystery. In an attempt to be seated, we joined forces with another trio, but the possibility of separate checks was dismissed with an unnecessary rudeness that was the final straw.

This once-beloved spot has lost its way, succumbing to an air of overrated mediocrity. Suffice to say, I won't be returning to witness the elusive ""triangular tables"" purported to seat only three. What a disappointment.",1
10385,"We won't visit again only if there is no line. The boil is really popular that it tools us almost 2 hours to wait for a table for 6 people. Their seafood was fresh, well flavored with different sauce you could choose and sides were decent but everything was overpriced (cash only!). Their waiters served us not really friendly but the reason might be they were so rush all the time.",0
18795,"Title: A Satisfying Solo Dining Experience at [Restaurant Name]

I ventured into [Restaurant Name] with the intent of indulging in their famed braised pork rice and oyster omelette. Although I only had the opportunity to sample the braised pork rice, the dish did not disappoint. Opting for a seat at the bar, I was greeted by an attentive bartender who skillfully attended to my needs, ensuring my water glass was never empty.

The star of the meal, the braised pork rice, was a delightful mix of flavors. I particularly savored the addition of bamboo and pickled vegetables, which the staff encouraged incorporating into the rice. The pork, both tender and sufficiently fatty, was enveloped in a sauce that perfectly married with the rice - a true testament to the kitchen's ability to execute this dish with finesse. 

While I remain somewhat skeptical about trying other items on the menu due to mixed reviews from friends, my personal encounter at [Restaurant Name] was thoroughly enjoyable. Both the food and service have left a positive impression, and I'll certainly be back for more of that comforting braised pork rice.",1

14232,"Title: A Rainy Day Delight at Mulberry Street's Hidden Gem

My taste buds are still celebrating after our serendipitous discovery on Mulberry Street – a charming vegan dim sum paradise that graciously accepts card payments, perfect for cashless diners like us.

From the moment we stepped in, the warmth of the staff complemented the cozy ambiance, patiently guiding us through our myriad inquiries. The highlight was undoubtedly the dumplings – a medley of three exquisite varieties, with the vegetarian soup dumplings stealing my heart and satisfying a long-held craving.

Our leisurely feast, perfect for the drizzly weather, included savory veggie meatballs and was accompanied by soothing hot tea – a match made in heaven. The affordability was the cherry on top, leaving us stunned at the modest bill for our indulgent spread.

Promising to return, we left with a laundry list of untried dishes that beckoned for future visits. This spot is a must for anyone craving delectable vegan fare without breaking the bank.",1
12476,"Title: Flavorful Pho with a Bone Marrow Misstep

I recently visited a restaurant known for its Beef Pho and eagerly ordered it with bone marrow—an addition I'd been keen to try. Starting with the positives, the broth was a standout: rich, aromatic, and so delightful that I could happily sip on it alone. The service mirrored the quality of the broth—attentive and swift, making for a pleasant dining experience within a well-appointed interior that adds to the restaurant's inviting ambiance.

However, the bone marrow itself fell short of expectations. It arrived cold, seemingly undercooked, which was a stark contrast to the warm, melted marrow I've savored at other establishments. Hesitant, I attempted to let it warm in the broth, but it failed to reach the decadent, falling-off-the-bone stage I anticipated.

Despite this letdown, the excellence of the broth and the overall experience gives me enough reason to return. Perhaps this was an isolated incident, so I'm willing to give the bone marrow another shot in hopes of a more satisfying encounter.",1
15738,"Superb lunch experience!!! We started with octopus which was perfect and followed with seared tuna salad, finishing with walnut cake. Wow, just wow! Beautiful space and great service. I would recommend going for slightly later lunch if possible as it gets pretty loud and crowded during the peak lunch time.",0
16924,"This place is GORGEOUS! It was my second time getting hot pot so my friends ordered for me and they chose so well. It is ~$28/person for unlimited hot pot. The service was so quick, the variety was amazing (everything from whole raw crab to lamb to Japanese pumpkin) and the atmosphere was both relaxed and lively. I will definitely make this place one that I frequent, especially now that it's cold outside. Good prices ($4 beer and $8 wine), good service, good food. I love love love this place. So quality.",0
1646,"Don't know why I always feel compelled to point out that ""I don't often give five star ratings"" when I actually give them -- maybe because I'm a perfectionist Virgo.But I digress.As I was saying, I don't often give five star ratings, but Il Punto absolutely earned it in my book! It's on the corner of a neighborhood that is ""up and coming"" (behind and a little south of Port Authority and walking distance from Penn Station on 9th Ave.). When you look at it from the outside, you may feel like you're walking into a butcher shop on Arthur Avenue -- it looks very old school. Please don't judge that as anything other than you're about to go into a place that is warm and inviting, with delicious food and wonderful service.First of all, I was extremely early for our reservation. Rather than go to a coffee shop and risk coming in smelling like Starbuck's, I went into the place and asked whether I could sit at the bar and read until my friend arrived. ""Of course,"" they said, and brought me a drink. Loved being able to sit and just have the background noise of the diners along with the music as I read and sipped.Once my friend arrived, we were seated immediately, and then sashayed through a most delicious, leisurely late lunch. We actually made our reservation for 2pm, which is at the tail end of both the business lunch rush and right before they stop serving in order to prepare for dinner, and this worked out great; the place is small, which means when it is packed (as it was before 2:00), it can get a bit loud.We shared a caprese salad to start, and the mozzarella just melted in our mouths. I had the ziti con melanzane with ricotta salata and it was a wonderfully sweet and salty combination. My friend had a seafood dish; I'm allergic to seafood so didn't taste it, but she made all the appropriate ""mooing"" sounds to make me thing she was enjoying it. Portions are perfectly sized -- real Italian restaurants get that you want to be able to have multiple courses, and so to have huge bowls of this, that or the other things means you won't get to enjoy as many different experiences. And you definitely want to save room for dessert.We had the warm chocolate cake with vanilla gelato -- what a warm, not-too-sweet ending to a most delicious lunch! Our servers were also the perfect balance of checking in on us and letting us enjoy our time together. We stayed a long time, and never felt rushed. If there had been a fireplace in this place, we would've almost felt like we were in someone's home, we were that welcomed here.A few people commented on the price of their meals -- what I'll share is that a) you're in New York City and b) the alcohol is what really adds to the tab. We, too, had cocktails at lunch, which made our tab a bit higher -- but if you choose not to have drinks/wine (or if you just have one), you'll see a significant difference in the bill at the end. The food prices are actually quite reasonable, and they have a prix fixe menu at both lunch and dinner.Before the meal was over, my friend and I went on Open Table and made a reservation to return in January. We so look forward to our next meal there!",0
15008,"Last night's visit to Sarabeth's, a staple for my boyfriend and me, was a mix of highs and lows. The happy hour boasts an unbeatable $7 Cosmo—though it tasted as affordable as it was priced. We started with a generous Caesar salad, ideal for sharing.

Excited to try new offerings, I opted for the short rib pot roast, and my boyfriend enjoyed the chicken pot pie. While the short rib impressed at first, it unfortunately seemed to be the culprit behind a severe bout of food poisoning that struck me later.

Sarabeth's is synonymous with decadence in desserts, and they didn't disappoint. The banana split and chocolate truffle cake were indulgently sizable. Leftovers of the latter even made it home with me.

The ambiance was top-notch: live music set the tone until 9 pm, and the festive decor added a cozy holiday warmth. Despite the restaurant's charm and past experiences, the distressing aftermath of this meal means a necessary break from Sarabeth's for the sake of my stomach.",1
3032,"I came during the holidays, when the bar transforms into Sippin' Santa, and thought it was really fun. Weeknight crowd was chill and my friend and I got a table right away. My drink (Kris Kringle colada) was very tasty. The decor was super cute too!",0

1378,"My BF surprised me for our Vday dinner and was impressed with the festive decor, elegant seating and fancy feathers on the wall, just simple elegance.  The resto is situated in the Flatiron district near Theodore Roosevelt's birthplace, which was pretty awesome.  Our waiter from the start was enthusiastic about the menu and was top notch in service.  For starters, we ordered the Main lobster salad (boiled to perfection) and foie gras creme brûlée with the mouthwatering sweet and savory flavors. We paired our meal with the suggested wine pairing and it pulled all the flavors amazingly.  Our main dishes were slow cooked Alaskan halibut and stuffed brune landaise ballotine, both were standouts.  We've never had brune landaise ballotine, which was aged chicken wrapped in pork meat and bathed in truffle reduction sauce, splendid indeed. The gnocchi that accompanied the halibut was divine and the saffron sauce added a bit of oomph to the tasty fish dish.  Our desserts were a bit too tarty, such as the sorbet that accompanied the chocolate tart. Nevertheless it was a delicious dessert to cleanse one's palate.  Coming into this restaurant not knowing their speciality protein is chicken was a pleasant surprise because the non chicken dishes are worth a try.",0
16561,"What make B side A-1 pizza on the west-side of Manhattan? Two words: KILLER BEE. Why you say?

17155,"This place is a cool stop. Close to our hotel and plenty of memorabilia to look at throughout the bar. There was 1 bartender who took care of the entire bar, and it was pretty busy. The Guinness was very good on tap. We ordered the chicken tenders with the honey mustard dipping sauce. Very juicy and delicious. Glad we stopped here!",0
12823,"Good stuff. Super crowded and busy so expect long waits and tight seating, but otherwise pretty good Thai food. I agree with the other reviews that the crab in their signature dish (ratchaburi pork and crab noodles) is not that great (and that there isn't much of it), but otherwise the other meats and noodles were delish. The fried tofu appetizer wasn't bad either.",0
10019,"My recent visit to this gem of a restaurant for a date was driven by its reputation for an outstanding beer selection, and it did not disappoint. The variety of craft beers on tap was nothing short of impressive, featuring renowned breweries such as Hudson Valley, Bissell Brothers, and Hill Farmstead. Each sip was a testament to their commitment to quality brews. Additionally, the tater tots were a deliciously crispy revelation—a perfect pairing to the pints. I'm already looking forward to my next visit. Cheers to a truly legit experience!",1
12458,"Title: A Unique Catch & Dine Experience

If you’re looking for an interactive dining adventure, this restaurant provides a novel twist by allowing you to catch your dinner before it’s served. We opted for an appetizer of tempura, which was a pleasant start to our meal. Afterward, we enjoyed the fun of fishing for our mains, successfully landing a trout and a bass that were ample for our party of four.

The overall quality of the food was decent, though not extraordinary. However, the experience of catching your own fish added an exciting element to the outing. It's worth noting that the novelty comes with a higher price tag; the experience felt a bit expensive relative to the food quality.

Be cautious with the menu – I recommend thoroughly reviewing the pricing to avoid any end-of-meal sticker shock. Despite the cost, the catch-and-eat concept makes for an engaging experience, especially for those seeking a more hands-on approach to dining.",1
16512,"I had a delightful dining experience at this cozy spot! The food really made an impression with their exceptional soup dumplings, savory noodles, and mouthwatering beef pancakes. Portions were generous, providing great value for the price. Just a heads-up, they only accept cash or American Express. Despite the restaurant's compact size, its charm adds to the inviting ambiance. Highly recommended for a satisfying meal!",1
16146,Came here for a team dinner after work. We basically reserved the whole front area. It was nice because we were able to order ahead of time before we got to the restaurant and add on as well. They had great customer service.The sushi was good and quality was good. Not a bad price for what you would pay at other fancier sushi restaurants. They have a great selection as well and beersI ordered a small Chirashi bowl set and also yakitori set. It was more food than I expected and I was pretty full. I like the place and would come back if I needed a nice spacious sushi place.That's all I have to say since most my experience here was watching my coworker eat chirashi for the first time being very awkward with place meant of his soy sauce dish and also just how to eat it in general. It was hilarious.Will update this in future when I come back again!,0
17428,Well I have to give this place a 5 because I met my future wife here  But all seriousness the food quality is a 4.  I love the tap beers they have. It is a chill restaurant with great chicken and other Korean food. Can't go wrong.,0
14070,"Title: Another Stellar Experience at Kahlo

This was my second visit to Kahlo, and just like the first, it deserves nothing less than a five-star review. The food remains outstanding across the board. From the guac combo to the octopus, every dish was a hit on our table – particularly the tuna tostada, molotes, elotes, branzino, and the veggie tacos. I appreciated the kitchen's flexibility in up-sizing our servings from three portions to four without a fuss.

The service was as attentive as ever, ensuring our dining experience was seamless. It's a mystery how this gem isn't packed every night, though I'm secretly grateful for the ease of snagging a reservation.

The only sticking point, which mirrors my previous visit, is the pricey drinks. Although it's a small shadow on an otherwise flawless outing, it's something to consider when budgeting for the night.

I'm already looking forward to my next visit, where I anticipate leaving yet another five-star review for Kahlo.",1
1741,"Zengo, aptly named for the Japanese concept of ""give and take,"" masterfully blends Latin and Asian culinary traditions in its eclectic menu. My experience with the Chili ShortRib Empanada was sublime; the Malaysian puff pastry was a perfect vessel for the richly-seasoned beef short ribs, while the chili, coconut, and ginger provided a symphony of taste, further enhanced by the fresh cilantro sauce and tangy pickled vegetables. The Balinese Chicken, featuring a perfectly grilled corn salsa, pickled chayote, and a light coconut broth, did not disappoint either – the chicken itself was succulent and full of flavor. The pairing of ingredients felt thoughtful, and the portions generous without overwhelming. In short, Zengo is a delightful culinary journey, marrying bold flavors in a harmonious dining experience.",1
20962,"Great Thai food near Times Square! The beef here is very fresh and the chow fun is very tasty! We got the jungle fried curry rice and it was fabulous! The pad see ew was also okay just a little too sweet. So if you ever want some authentic tasty Thai food, come to this place!",0
15911,"Title: Modern Twist on Greek Classics at EONS

I recently dined at EONS and was instantly drawn to the Create Your Own option – a delightful mix reminiscent of Chipotle's customization but with a Greek twist. I opted for a blend of beef and lamb yeero, a fresh salad, and what was dubbed a ""Greek"" salad topping of cucumbers, tomatoes, and onions. To complement the greens, I added sides of hummus and tzatziki.

The salad components were refreshing and the meat was decently prepared, reflecting the essence of traditional Greek flavors. However, the hummus left much to be desired – lacking in flavor and resembling something one might expect from an instant mix rather than a rich, authentic spread.

One notable downside was the assumption made by the staff regarding my dining preference; my meal was automatically packaged to go with no inquiry, resulting in a less environmentally friendly plastic container instead of a dine-in bowl.

In summary, EONS offers a novel approach to Greek fare, although they could brush up on flavors and service details.",1
13593,"So this experience was so cool and it such a nifty craft that just so happens to be something that you can actually eat, which obviously makes it so much better. My friend and i got the Matcha Lava and the Harvest desserts. The presentation is honestly what blows it away. Especially the harvest, with it looking like a little plant. The Matcha Lava was good, definitely not overly sweet and it was just enough to kick the sweet tooth without being overbearing so I was super pleased with it. Next time I'm back in NY I'll definitely stop by so I can try something else off the menu and I hope to be as pleasantly surprised as I was the first time around.",0

3502,"If you ever have an invitation to dine or participate in an event here, do not pass it up for anything. The University Club is a very exclusive place that you need a membership to enter. Presidents, rock stars, and athletes have eaten and stayed here. Somehow, I ended up at a school event hosted here by an alum of my program, who's a member. We had a ten-person dinner in a smaller room upstairs, but on my way there, I took the liberty of giving myself an unofficial tour, and let me tell you, this place is money! That dining hall is shaped like the Sistine Chapel! Anyway, the service here is not stuffy at all, like you may expect. They are so sweet, and one waiter even found out I was Iranian and went to track down another Iranian waiter from another floor to introduce him to me! How thoughtful! Our food was simple and fresh, very much what you'd expect from a social club. We had warm nuts, salmon bites, and croquettes while we were all mingling. We had a salad, a choice between salmon and chicken, and a fruit and three scoops of sorbet in an edible chocolate cup (!!!). I got the salmon, which was cooked to perfection and came with tomatoes and mashed potatoes. Overall, the meal was safe, made with quality ingredients, and comforting. It wasn't an amazing and life-changing meal, but it didn't have to be. It was a delicious American meal that suited all tastes. Feeling lucky to have experienced a taste of this secret social club. Pretty cool place with obviously well-connected people. Excited to be a member in my own right one day!",0

14635,"Came here on Thursday for the wine dinner - $69 a person for unlimited wine pairings ""copious amounts of wine"" as they put it, and each person chooses an app, entree , and dessert. The halibut was our favorite entree, and the gnocchi appetizer was our favorite. I got the grilled octopus appetizer and it was overcooked. For dessert, the egg nog and s'mores were a toss up and arguably the best items of the night. Their desserts were unreal.Our waiter was super funny and we really enjoyed him. Not sure if we'd do the wine dinner again- the wine was pretty cheap tasting but that's to be expected with stuff like that . Highly recommend the food though- it was fantastic and our entire experience was great there !",0
12168,"Didn't really realize this coming in but this place specializes in food that have bugs in it. That being said, there are options that do not have bugs in it. I'll start with the good and work my way to the bad. The service here is impeccable. Very nice, water was always filled. Whenever our drinks were empty, they came back and asked us if we needed another. The food came out quickly and everyone was super friendly towards us. The food itself was pretty good. Tacos were very flavorful the guac was delicious and a heaping bowl (this was the only menu item that was bigger than expected) However, these were all things that we got on happy hour for $10. If we had to go during off hours, I would never pay that much for tacos etc. Especially for a place that is so far from the train. We also tried the ceviche which had amazing flavor, and the fish was extremely tender. But again the dish was a bit small. The tacos came with 2 each. Finally, there is the situation with the bugs. Honestly, it doesn't bother me at all and I think it's quite interesting. A cool sustainable way of eating. However, my friend was kind of grossed out by it all. And even though we didn't order any food with the bugs in it, she ended up getting a margarita and the salt had ants in it. I ended up eating / licking all the salt off for her and it literally tasted like just jalapeno salt. Ain't no thang! TL;DR: Great for happy hour, questionably expensive for other times. Happy Hour: $5 Beers$7 Wine $8 Margs (including the flavored ones) $10 Select Menu items.",0
3189,"We made a reservation for 7:30 pm on Thursday and they were lucky enough to give us a table outside on the rooftop which was so lovely. Great vibe and service. I got the branzino which I thought was in fact delicious, especially with the rice! However, I do think everything is a bit overpriced for the creativity of the food. It's a vibe to try and a popular restaurant. Just make sure you're willing to spend.",0
2560,"Soooo this is my new favorite bottomless brunch spot in NYC!!!First off, all of the staff were wearing light pink t-shirts that said 'Mimosa Mafia'. Wish they had them for sale! Our waitress was amazing - wish I had caught her name. She was super friendly and accommodating and every time I talked to her, I felt like I was talking to one of my girlfriends. We ordered the bottomless mimosas and within a minute, our waitress appeared with a full carafe. Our carafe was never empty as it was always being topped off - so who knows how much we actually drank!I ordered the Eggs Florentine. Delicious! It came with a side salad and potatoes. Definitely a good meal to order when you're doing a bottomless drink situation. $43 for 2 hours = bottomless drinks and an entree with quick friendly service. Can't beat it!",0
18150,"During a recent search for a quick bite near the Hilton Midtown, my spouse and I had the pleasure of stumbling upon a gem called Sacco. Skeptical at first due to my husband's discerning pizza palate, we decided to give it a try and were pleasantly surprised.

We ordered two classic cheese slices, which to our delight were exceptionally light with the perfect crisp crust that you anticipation in the first bite. The fold test? Passed with flying colors as the tip stood tall. The sauce was notably flavorful, leaving us eager to return for the Sicilian slice that caught our eye.

In stark contrast to Sacco's warm embrace, we've been sorely disappointed by Ray's. On our last visit, they were inexplicably out of essential staples like cheese and pepperoni slices, forcing us to settle for an overpriced combo slice. Worse still, we noticed a freshly made cheese pie intentionally hidden away to prioritize selling older slices. This tactic cost Ray's our patronage for good.

Sacco, on the other hand, is a quintessential neighborhood spot. Our experience was enriched by friendly locals, including a woman who's been a regular for over 30 years. Their resounding endorsement of Sacco aligns with our newfound admiration. Moreover, at just $2.50 a slice, the value is unbeatable. Sacco has easily won over our hearts and appetites – we too now sing its praises!",1
2062,"Ssam Bar is a go-to restaurant in NYC if you haven't already been. And if you have, go again. The menu is always changing, they have totally different items for brunch, lunch, and dinner.In the past year, I've been to Ssam twice. Once for brunch, and once for dinner. Both times, it was an awesome experience from the ambiance, the service, and most importantly: the food.The brunch was super memorable with some unforgettable dishes. No longer on the menu was a seasonal grapefruit salad with Marcona almonds and vinaigrette. Still one of the most delicious salads I've ever had! Then, there was the avocado toast layered with the Ssam sausage stuffed rotisserie duck. So. GOOD. This is an awesome place to come for brunch, and I highly recommend!More recently, I stopped in for dinner with two of my friends. We had such a fun, glutinous experience! Some of my favorites were the shrimp toast, scallops with preserved lemon, rice cakes, and the banana leaf roasted skate. And for dessert.... both the coconut pie and skillet cornbread are a must!I've heard the fried chicken for lunch is insane. Can't wait to go back!",0
17970,"This is my favorite pub from our visit to New York. Warm, cozy, and imbued with the unmistakeable woodsiness that embodies an Irish Pub. Quiet and inviting, it's a great place to grab a pint or a cocktail. Seating was spacious, there was no line or issue getting a table when we went in around 5PM. It's not too far from Rockefeller center, so if you're going to take in any attractions or shopping there, this is a great place to hydrate before or after. Their selection of beers on tap were good - the Merman IPA was especially good - and the bartender makes a mean Manhattan. Service was prompt. I would definitely pay the Pig and Whistle a return visit next time we're in New York.",0

It's not enough"". We explained that we weren't very hungry and then he repeated ""It's not enough, I'm just telling you it's not enough"". - While we understood the need to be clear about their portion sizes, we were fully aware of the amount of food that was ordered.- Our dishes came and went and then our waiter returned; ""was that enough? Are you sure you don't want anything else?""- We kind of looked at each other, then reassured him that we were ok. - This whole interaction rubbed us the wrong way. Maybe he was trying to serve us more dishes, maybe he was worried we didn't have enough to eat. But the fact that he felt it was necessary to judge the amount of food we wanted at that time, made us uncomfortable.",0

I assumed the food is good and cheap enough to warrant the wait so I knew I'd make my move when I saw a chance!  I passed by Wah Fung on a Sunday at 10:45am and was surprised to find no line!  I walked in the door, ordered 3 large orders of roast pork over white rice to go.  Only $6 each for a huge portion of pork and cabbage.  I am mostly plant based but had to try a piece of pork.  I now understand why there is a line of people out the door on most days.  The pork isn't fatty, greasy or overly sweet. It's just right, succulent and satisfying.  You can't go wrong for $6!  There's so much pork in one order that my kids got 2 meals out of it and declared it top notch delicious!  I know they'd happily eat it again, I guess I'll be looking for my next opening soon.  After I left with my order, four people walked in and a line was soon forming out the door!",0
1424,"Marta has become the designated lady date restaurant for my good friend and I. It's close enough to Penn Station and the price, with the tip built in, is just right. We've been to Marta a handful of times and across the board, we've enjoyed it immensely. We came here last week and unfortunately, they changed the menu since we've last been in December. The replacement pizzas seem to be more eclectic with a boatload of ingredients that I don't necessarily enjoy all together. The additional desserts also leave much to be desired.Obtaining a reservation regardless of the day of the week or time is super easy. The restaurant is huge, with high ceilings and large windows looking out onto East 29th Street. It is located in the Redbury hotel so it's pretty easy to miss, like I did on my first jaunt over there. We always get two pizzas to share, they are thin crust and two hungry gals can surely wolf them down. The starring role of our dinner is consistently the Margherita [$19]. It's such a reliable staple. It's pizza in it's purest form: mozzarella, tomato sauce, and basil. The flavors were spot on as usual and it was cooked perfectly in the coal fired oven. The waiter did try to up sell us on adding ingredients, of course the priciest ones. No thanks, dude. We also decided to get the very forgettable Bufala [$26] as none of the other options really appealed to us [clams on pizza...ick...sorry Rhode Island!]. The crust was somehow overly charred and crumbled in my hand as I ate the slice. I couldn't particularly discern the vodka sauce from the onion confit from the tomato compote either. It was all really one note. For dessert, I had the Cinnamon Roll Sundae Pop [$9], which is nice in theory, but a little weird to be served what is essentially a Good Humor ice cream on a plate or an upscale Starbucks cake pop [gag]. The cream cheese gelato was nice, as was the cinnamon streusel inside. The cinnamon sugar sprinkled on top fell off and got messy. The whole thing y reminded me of an elevated Cinnabon. It could have been so much better but for now, I could do without this.  My friend had the Panna Cotta [$10] which was better than what I had but still not the best dessert ever. The hazelnut crumble was abundant and also made a mess when you tried to dip the spoon into each layer of panna cotta. The panna cotta itself was set well but there was a little too much strawberry jelly, which overpowered the delicate panna cotta. We did not have alcohol so the total was $70, $35 each.",0
18050,I honestly have not had better tasting tacos !!!!!!! This is a must visit . The place is  small and only standing room to eat but worth it . Excellent flavor . Amazing guacamole and spicy salsa . True authentic taste makes me want to come back here time and time again . My personal fav is pollo asado on corn or flour tortilla prepped with everything exactly how it comes and 3 is not enough lol .,0
14331,"This place is not easy to find as it is on the second floor of another restaurant and pub. The food quality was average, the service was good. There was only 3 tables eating during the lunch hour rush although a pending rain storm was about to hit. The reason for my 3 stars is due to lack of communication with the customer when they encountered an issue with the credit card processer and wifi. The issue took almost 10 minutes to resolve with no explanation.",0
17019,"This is a cool place to hang around. It was my first time there. They weren't too busy until later on. There was just 2 people running the tables so it was slow. It took a while for us to order food. Be patient. The food are food. We were having lunch special option. I got the salmon avó don, it has way too much rice. The noodles tastes good. I notice that they have happy hours from Monday to Thursday from 10pm to late. It was awesome and nice price for happy hours. I will come back to try it.",0
14548,"I absolutely adore this gem of a vegan restaurant! Initially unplanned, the inviting ambiance lured me in for a meal that took me by surprise. Every dish I sampled was delightful, but the shiitake bacon and maple-wheat croutons in the Kale Caesar were the stars – truly mind-blowing flavors! I'm already looking forward to my next visit to explore more of their delicious offerings.",1
15632,"I've been here a handful of times since they've opened (definitely try their burgers!) and always have a great experience. This past weekend, I finally got to try their awesome brunch which was bottomless with any entree for an additional $19 for 90 minutes. If you don't want to indulge, they also offer one complimentary drink with your entree. I ordered the French toast with a side of sausage. The food was great, sausage was really juicy and full of flavor. The French toast was light and fluffy and came with powdered sugar and some fruits. It definitely wasn't super filling so I would recommend going with some of the other dishes. My friend got the BEC and really enjoyed that. Service was attentive and we definitely drank our $19 worth. Definitely my new go-to for when I don't feel like traveling far for a good brunch. One thing to note, there were A LOT of babies/small children around. I wouldn't have minded much if the parents hadn't kept giving us funny looks. It's totally my right to have a good time at a bar that serves bottomless brunch! But the staff never made us feel unwelcome and I really appreciated that.",0
13320,"I had been wanting to try this place since they opened and finally got the opportunity to go. They have lunch special during the week from 11am to 4pm until January 12th where they'll only open from 4pm to 11pm with last order at 10:30pm. I ordered a medium rare 7oz Sirloin Set. It came with a cup of miso soup, mixed salad, and a choice of rice or mashed potatoes. The default veggie is corn, but you have the option to add additional veggies for an addition $1 or replace it with broccoli, potatoes, green beans, or onion for free. The veggies and the steak are served in a cast iron hot plate which allows you to further cook the steak if it's too rare. We're also given paper bibs to wear while eating because as soon as they bring the steak to the table, you can see oil particles splashing onto the bib. The steak was surprisingly tasty and tender...absolutely no sauce is required although they do have multiple sauce options on the table like the steak sauce, Ikinari sauce, pepper dressing, onion dressing, etc. They also have mochi with so many flavor options for dessert. I got the red bean and the matcha mochi. They came out hard and icy cold, fresh from the freezer. The service however is a hit or miss. Sometimes they are attentive and sometimes they aren't. Overall, I would come back again. Also save your receipt for points at another ikirina restaurant. Since this restaurant is new, their point system isn't yet fully implemented in their system until April of this year.",0
13035,"Title: A Pleasant Brunch with Standout Avocado Toast

My latest culinary venture led me to a bustling spot renowned for its avocado toast, a personal breakfast favorite of mine. The service initially impressed with its swiftness and attentiveness, despite the restaurant's evidently busy nature. Water was replenished regularly until the food arrived, after which check-ins from the staff became sporadic.

The avocado toast itself was a celebration of simplicity, its freshness enhanced by a zesty hint of lemon. A bit more grill on the toast could have elevated the dish, but it remained delightful. My companion opted for the French toast adorned with mixed berries and a compote that managed to win over my usually sweet-averse palate, helped by the dish's judicious sugar level.

The place doubles as a bakery, a fact worth noting for anyone looking for a quicker option or to grab bagels and coffee to go. While queuing for a table can test your patience, those solely after baked goods will find a separate, faster-moving line.

In summary, the restaurant is definitely worth a visit for its no-fuss, tasty breakfast offerings, and especially the avocado toast. Just remember to strategize if you're in a hurry!",1
1687,"I recently visited a local restaurant where I had a mixed dining experience. The noodles and broth were quite enjoyable, offering a rich and authentic flavor that I appreciated. However, the meat in the dish was disappointing; it was very tough, detracting from the overall enjoyment of the meal. On a positive note, the restaurant boasts an extensive sake menu that sake enthusiasts might find impressive.",1
14159,"Title: A Memorable Meal Before NYC's Pause

Before New York's bustling pace came to a halt, I had the chance to dine at a spacious and inviting restaurant in Harlem, which proved to be a serendipitous final outing. Right upon entry, the warm, lively atmosphere enveloped us, complemented by quaint brick walls, bursts of floral arrangements, soothing pale blue hues, rich wood paneling, and a collection of framed artwork that added character to the space.

Seated without delay, we were soon indulging in complimentary bread, fresh, warm, and slathered in butter. Opting for a soursop juice over a pina colada, I was rewarded with a cool, sweetly tart refreshment; a far cry from standard juice selections and a nod to my fondness for soursop shakes.

Our appetites were courted by an ample assorted platter featuring a gamut of textures and tastes - beef empanadas, croquettes, tostones, fried pork rinds, crispy chicken, and chorizo. While the empanadas were modestly satisfying, the tostones' crisp saltiness and the harmonious blend of ham, cheese, and potato in the croquettes stood out, especially when dipped in a sublime creamy sauce that also elevated the well-seasoned chicken.

The main courses did not disappoint. The pan-fried pork chops, with their succulent, seared perfection, claimed my preference, further enhanced by the fresh garnish of onions, peppers, and a crisp salad. The Vaca Frita offered a comforting, tomato-infused take on shredded flank steak, falling apart tenderly with every well-seasoned bite.

Yellow rice served as a base for our main dishes, and while it leaned towards the bland side, it became a willing canvas for the more robust flavors of the accompanying sauces.

Service, while initially mixed due to a minor communication hiccup, was ultimately saved by a second waiter whose personable and attentive manner made up for the earlier lag.

Concluding our meal entirely satisfied, we bypassed dessert, which seemed a non-issue given the absence of a dedicated menu and the satisfaction from our main courses.

Overall, my dining experience was one to remember - so much so that a return visit seems unnecessary for now, as I've sampled what felt like the best on offer. When life in New York resumes its rhythm, I'll look back on this meal as a delightful pre-pause treat.",1
12864,"My sister and I came across this place via Yelp and and a google search. We wanted to try some New York Pizza and Lombardi's popped up on the list. We figured it'd be good to try since it was well known in the city. I wasn't sure what to expect but I knew I had to try their Margherita pizza, it was what they were known for!We popped in for lunch and it was packed. We thought we would be waiting awhile but to our surprise we were taken in within 15 minutes. Service was attentive and the waitress was friendly and patient. The walls were covered in photos of the owner posing with famous celebrities so we knew we had come to a staple pizzeria in NYC.We came for pizza so that's exactly what we ordered. A medium Margherita pizza to share and being meatatarians, my sister and I decided to share the homemade meatballs. First off, the meatballs were good in their own right but what made the dish was the tomato sauce. There was nothing left on the plate when we were done. Second, the pizza was good, not the best margherita I've had but pretty good. Thin crust, a good amount of that delicious tomato sauce and a decent amount of the fresh mozerella. Not a bad pizza by all means.Overall, I'd say this place was warm and friendly, and the food was pretty tasty. The cost was a little on the higher side for what you get but we left full and satisfied nonetheless.",0
10319,"Really enjoyed this place for an easy pizza fix. It's casual yet fun for the whole family. Decor is nice and the pizza and unique apps will leave you coming back. We came here on a very busy Thursday night without a reservation. The maitre'd was super nice, and seated us upstairs at a four person table (even though we were two) Not sure what kind of pizza oven they have, but it definitely gets the job done! Pizza crusts are crispy. The arugula salad is drizzled with sweet balsamic glaze and fantastic. The potato croquettes looked good, filled with some kind of sausage and cheese. Nutella calzone looked unreal, as we saw the guy making it. Was a religious experience. If you don't care for porchini mushrooms, try not to get them as they seemed to make the pizza watery. Could have been the cherry tomatoes though. The staff seemed a bit overworked, but was very fast and attentive to details. Had to ask for bread and water though. Also, the bathroom on the first floor could use a cleaning. That said, they have ample seating upstairs. There were cameras all over and you could tell it's a professional spot and a successful operation. I'd like a better beer menu though, not just ""IPA"" lol..",0
19293,WOW - Leyla is amazing Turkish/Mediterranean food! I love how it's right near my hood too! It could also be a great dinner date spot! I came here for dinner and there wasn't a wait. Loved the vibe and I'll definitely come back again.Things I ordered: - Slow cooked short rib pide- Beetroot carpaccio salad- Hummus- Kataifi zucchini fritters- Falafel,0
2232,"I decent place for weekend brunch! We came in around 10 on a Saturday morning and it was not crowded yet. By the time we left around 11, it was starting to fill up. Our waitress was nice and quick. She brought us water and coffee. Coffee is pretty pricey and costs $1 for refills - not a great aspect for a brunch place... we ordered the banana bread and the granola. Also ordered a side of peanut butter because why not! The banana bread was to die for. The espresso mascarpone whipped topping was amazing. The bread was super dense and filling. The granola was amazing as well. A very light and refreshing yogurt and very delicious and fresh granola. The peanut butter was also outstandingly delicious. This place exceeded my expectations in terms of food, but definitely pricey for the amount of food you get. Overall a good experience though and a cozy little place.",0
13229,"As a seasoned brunch-goer, I can tell when I've hit a great spot, and this is one of them – the bustling crowd of discerning women is a telltale sign. We started with the biscuits, which were perfectly crisp and golden, almost melting under the drizzle of sweet honey and a dash of shaved salt. The Chicken and Waffles entrée was exceptional; the buckwheat waffles were a delightful discovery, providing a hearty base for the succulent fried chicken. Topping it off with their Tabasco Honey combo was a stroke of genius – a balancing act of sweet and spicy that I highly recommend. This dish has set a new brunch benchmark for me.",1
10707,"Highly recommend coming here for lunch. I love soba and their's hits the spot. I will say though that it's pretty pricey, which is why I try to come for lunch. They have lunch deals where you can choose from a variety of small rice bowls to have alongside either soba/udon (hot/cold). However, given the name of the establishment, I don't see a reason to choose the udon. I normally order their sake oyako don (salmon sashimi & salmon roe over rice) and their cold soba. My friend chose the una don for his lunch set and it was good too! It definitely seemed worth the price. The lunch sets are enough to fill you up without feeling bloated. They also have a special $17 bento box, which is only available for the first 25 people who order it. I never got a chance to order it, but I'd like to one day. An important note: it gets bustling very quickly, so a wait may be expected. The atmosphere and interior, however, are very nice and exude authentic Japanese vibes. Overall, I can't say Soba-ya has the best tasting and affordable soba in the city, but for its taste and ambience, it's still pretty solid.",0
13985,"As a weekly regular at this no-frills eatery, I can't help but come back for their Neapolitan-style margherita pizza that truly evokes memories of Italy. The service is swift, ensuring each pizza arrives fresh out of the oven. For those looking to add a little extra kick to their meal, I highly recommend asking for chili flakes – it really elevates the already fantastic pizza to new heights. A must-visit for any pizza aficionado.",1
2854,"I recently visited this local pizzeria with high hopes for their much-talked-about Pizza del Rey and Montanara, the latter being a novelty for me with its fried dough. True to its reputation, the dough here is fantastic—tough, chewy, and perfectly thick, serving as an ideal canvas for the toppings.

The Pizza del Rey did not disappoint. With a rich and flavorful topping, it paired beautifully with the delectable dough, making it my top pick of the meal. On the other hand, the Montanara was an intriguing encounter. The fried dough offered a unique crunch that deviated from the traditional pizza experience. While it was certainly different and worth trying for the curious, I have to admit that it slightly overshadowed what I believe to be the restaurant's star element: the dough.

In a nutshell, if you're a pizza aficionado in search of a robust and satisfying crust, this is the place for you. The Pizza del Rey will likely steal your heart, as it did mine, while the Montanara stands as an interesting detour from the classic pizza path.",1
2236,"Title: A Mixed Bag Experience at the IG-Famous Taco Spot

After succumbing to the Instagram hype, I ventured out to try the restaurant renowned for its mammoth tacos. Opting out of the taco challenge (ideal for an exceedingly large group), I was unfortunately too late for happy hour. The Passion fruit and Guava margaritas I ordered were mediocre—adequate in flavor but disappointingly weak on the alcohol front. However, thanks to a Yelp check-in, a complimentary tequila shot somewhat saved the day, delivering more of a kick than the margaritas.

The food was a mixed experience. My Gordita, which I mistakenly assumed would resemble Taco Bell's offering, turned out to be an Arepa filled with burrata cheese, tomatoes, avocado, and I chose chicken over the traditional chicharon. The Arepa itself was a delight, with the combination of ingredients working well together. My companions enjoyed their Steak tacos, which were satisfactory, and the Truffle fries, though tasty, could have benefited from a more robust truffle essence.

The rooftop seating was spacious and fitting for a warm day, but be warned about the mosquitoes—they can be quite the nuisance. The ambiance was decent, with music in the air, although the DJ’s club-like antics were a touch overbearing for a dining setting.

Service was friendly but on the slower side, and when it comes to value, the drinks felt overpriced. All in all, this place has the potential for a fun outing, particularly in a group setting, but certain elements could be fine-tuned for a better overall experience.",1
10796,"Spacious, cute restaurant with large, clear windows outlooking the Seaport District. I ordered the Bacon Burger which is the Classic Burger with bacon and Louisiana Hot Wings. The burger was juicy and comes with fries. The wings were flavorful and not like regular hot sauce. They had a touch of Southern taste to it with sprinkled cheese and veggies on top. Overall, the service and experience was great!",0
17402,"Title: A Dive into the Delights of Mizu

Upon my latest culinary adventure, I had the pleasure of dining at Mizu, a sushi spot that effortlessly blends traditional offerings with a contemporary vibe. At the recommendation of enthusiastic staff, I embarked on a journey through some of the restaurant's most lauded dishes.

Starting off with the Rock Shrimp Tempura, I was impressed with the harmonious blend of spicy garlic honey sauce and crunchy fried onions, making for an appetizer that was both shareable and scrumptious. The Spicy Tuna Gyoza followed suit, but with a twist—nestled atop a bed of guacamole and a sweet and spicy sauce, it's a fusion dish that truly stands out.

However, it was the White Tuna Truffle that stole the show. Its mix of seared white tuna, truffle oil, and yuzu soy was simply sublime and spoke volumes about why this dish is highlighted as a signature offering.

The selection of over 20 signature rolls makes for difficult decision-making, but the Pink Roll wrapped in its namesake pink soy paper and the fiery Bahamas Roll with its spicy grilled salmon were clear standouts. Both boasted freshness and creativity that encapsulated what modern sushi should be about.

Mizu prides itself on its Omakase sushi experience, which I now understand is a leap of faith into the chef's hands for a custom, chef-selected meal. While I typically steer away from raw fish, I commend Mizu for offering this trendy experience at an affordable price, enticing for both novices and connoisseurs alike.

The ambiance of the space is matched by the passion of its owner, David, whose dedication is reflected in every aspect of the restaurant—from the quality and presentation of the food to the professionalism of the staff. Chef Nakao Hirakata's menu caters to all palates, including those less inclined to indulge in raw fish.

Situated conveniently in the Flatiron neighborhood, Mizu is a gem that promises a delightful sushi experience whether you're catching up with friends, on a date, or simply craving exceptional sushi. I'm already looking forward to my next visit.",1
14597,"Title: A Slice Above the Rest at This Pizzeria

I'm not usually one for regular pizza, but I've just had a game-changing experience at this gem of a pizzeria. The personal pies, boasting a tantalizingly thin crust and a canvas of inventive toppings, are a true delight. I indulged in an array of pizzas such as the Muffled Trushroom, BellaWalley, Sausage Luau, and the Classic Cheese. Each was exceptional, with flavors that burst forth from their diminutive size.

The beauty of these thin-crust marvels is how they leave you craving more, allowing you to explore a wider range of their flavor-packed offerings without filling up too fast. It's a paradise for variety-seekers. Health-conscious foodies will appreciate the gluten-free options, ensuring there's a slice for every preference.

Adding to the experience was José's stellar service. His attentiveness and genuine kindness topped off the meal as the perfect accompaniment to an already impressive feast. If you're looking for pizza that packs a punch in flavor and won't weigh you down, look no further than this outstanding pizzeria.",1
18619,"I've been here a few times for Happy Hour and a couple of times for lunch, as its right down the block for my job and super convenient.   Both times I had the cobb salad, which was fine--nothing to write home about, just your average chicken cobb salad!   It starts getting a bit more crowded around 1pm, but never crazy.   I would rather limit my time here to happy hour which is a nice full crowd, bartenders are great (most w/ an Irish accent which is a great touch) and prices are decent.",0
15114,"After eyeing this place and seeing the great reviews, I decided to make a reservation and pop in for dinner on a Friday night. The decor was nice although seating is tight. We were seated next to 2 tables that had 3 diners each, making it a hassle to use the restroom when necessary.We got seated and got to ordering! I got the shoo shoo burger and the arayes. Sitting in anticipation as this would my first real meal of the day and boy...was I disappointed.The shoo shoo burger came out first. I ordered it medium rare. It was pink in the middle but still managed to be dry. Didn't think it was possible for the beef to be pink but still be dry. The bun was also hard in a bad way, didn't feel nor tasted good to eat with. The fries were ok, on the dry and over fried side. Burger patty was also a bit small. Overall, quite a let down as my hunger did not even help improve the taste one bit.The arayes was ok. The hummus wasn't bad, spicy with the green pepper but the meat had a weird taste and texture to it. Definitely not the typical lamb.Overall, this was quite the letdown. I came high expectations and left disappointed.",0
12391,"Title: A Gourmet Haven for Seafood Lovers

I recently dined at a restaurant that can only be described as a seafood aficionado's dream come true. The highlight of their offering is an impressive selection of bluefin cuts - whether you crave the lean akami, the buttery chutoro, or the decadently fatty toro, you'll find them all masterfully presented in a donburi that's nothing short of perfection.

But the delights don't end there. The restaurant also boasts an array of uni varieties, each with its own unique taste of the sea. It's a rarity to find such variety, and this place does not disappoint. The rice accompanying these treasures deserves its own mention; it's cooked just right, forming the ideal base for the fine seafood it supports.

The pricing, while not particularly cheap, is reasonable for the quality you receive. Presentation is also a notable aspect, with the 'Box of Dreams' living up to its whimsical name, showcasing the day's best offerings in a way that is as visually appealing as it is appetizing.

The atmosphere leans towards the formal side, which might explain the slight stuffiness in the air. A touch of music could do wonders to add warmth to the ambience. That said, the service was attentive and professional, rounding out an overall good dining experience.",1
15102,"Special thanks to Julia, Meredith, and Albert for recommending this place. I was told to go here instead of another local joint, because apparently the other joint is ""trash"" (not my words).The first part that stood out, when got to Menkoi Sato, was that it's not one of these fusion, American-influenced, modern ramen joints. Walking in, I felt like I was transported into a different world. Part of this was due to the fact that all the employees were Asian (likely Japanese, but I'm not one to play the guessing game) as were all the customers.It was a little warm outside, so I sat at the bar in the corner, by the door, which welcomed a nice spring breeze every now and again. I definitely recommend that you remove some layers before coming in.As far as the ramen... don't believe the other reviews and do your research. There ARE vegetarian broths available, not all broths are protein based. While they say the broths are all Hokaido style, there are several variations... for example, the Shoyu is a soy sauce base and here it comes with ground pork. The Sapporo style refers to the use of miso (which is a soy bean paste). If you have dietary needs, they do a good job about asking for them before you order.I did the Spicy Shoyu Ramen and I was not disappointed. It came out super hot, super flavorful, and super stacked with noodles and other ingredients like egg, pork, and seaweed. I think the noodle amount is just right, as long as you're going back and forth between having the soup and eating the noodles.Service was attentive and friendly. Everyone greeted customers on their way in and their way out. I was served a super hot bowl in less than 10 minutes (I watched them cook it all from scratch immediately after I ordered.)There's not much else to add. This experience and quality is right up there with Ippudo, and I'd love to visit again to try some of the other offerings.",0
3589,"Y'all?  Go.  Just go.  Or get delivery.  Then repeat.  This place emanates the heart of what New Yorker New Yorker's love about this city: finding those unassuming, true gems of hole-in-the-wall spots where you walk in, are sincerely welcomed, get great service, are wowed with each bite, leave you wondering how soon you can come back, and - when that next visit comes - have you excited the entire day.That's what Buena Vista is offering.  Get in their door/on their delivery queue, and keep that business flowing!",0
3086,"I finally made it to Raku in the East Village on a Saturday evening and was pleasantly surprised to find some tables available in the quaint space. My boyfriend and I started with the bacon appetizer, a small but standout dish featuring fatty, crispy slices with a complementary sauce and a welcome crunch from some added onions.

For the main course, I chose the Niku Udon, enticed by its appetizing photos and generous meat serving. Despite the rapid service, the dish fell short of expectations. What seemed like an Instagram sensation turned out to be an average bowl reminiscent of pho with different noodles and a heavier broth. Although the beef impressed with its perfect fat ratio, the lackluster vegetables and noodles didn't justify the hype or the price tag.

Note that the cozy venue does come with a high noise level, which may detract from the dining experience for some. While Raku has its merits, particularly the bacon dish, the overall meal didn't quite hit the mark.",1
13493,"Title: A Fiery Fiesta of Flavors at Times Square's Taco Stand

Bustling with the vibrant energy of Times Square, our recent culinary pitstop at this petite taco stand exceeded all expectations. Despite the intimidating queue, which usually heralds something extraordinary, we were eagerly welcomed by the promise of authentic Mexican fare that had already garnered a glowing reputation.

The menu, though concise, was a parade of classics: tacos, tostadas, muletas, and quesadillas, each prepared with a palpable passion for tradition. Opting for the steak tacos ""con todo,"" we were treated to a symphony of rich guacamole, fresh cilantro, piquant onions, and a zesty sauce cradled in tortillas handcrafted by the skilled señoras manning the counter—pure bliss!

The process was simple: order, pay, and present your slip to claim your feast. Beverage options like Jamaica and horchata provided a sweet respite from the ubiquitous bottled sodas. The catch? Finding a nook to savor your meal, as this stand adheres to a brisk 'eat-and-go' philosophy.

Each bite of the tacos and muleta was a fiesta in our mouths, although the quesadillas could have been more generous. A salsa bar, complete with crisp radishes and zestful limes, allowed for a customizable kick to each mouthful. Kudos to the diligent staff who, amidst the perpetual rush, ensured cleanliness and order.

In summary, for an on-the-go taste of Mexico amidst the urban jungle of New York City, look no further than this delightful taco stand in Times Square. Prepare for a rapid-fire dining experience that doesn't skimp on flavor!",1
10682,"I absolutely adored this establishment for so many reasons. We found this place because our beloved Ina Garten posted it on her social.We didn't have high expectations, we had seen pictures of some steak and the lasganette so we knew we'd probably get those for sure. We were celebrating my friend's belated bday.We had to wait a little over an hour on a Saturday night which was fair because we did a last minute walk in. We had some cocktails and hung out to the left of the bar. Time flew by because we had great drinks, talked about the things we wanted from the menu and how lovely the ambience once. They're going for ""old New York"" and I felt it! It was classic, nostalgic, cool but at the same time humble and refined. The staff was attentive and helpful, and we hadn't even sat down yet!Onto the food, we ordered... eight things. For two asian gals. I'm from out of town so I just wanted to try everything. Honestly, I enjoyed everything! Some amazing standouts, and some solid good bites. Sometimes a dish doesn't have to blow you away. It's cool to just see how all these dishes work together or eating something you've never had before in a unique execution. Ok, let's go on to the standouts:Cup of chicken broth. Oh this just warmed and comforted us and it was in the cutest little antique cup/bowl. Lasagnette - SO. GOOD! Lasagna is projected to be served more than ever in 2020 so I guess this was me manifesting that! Angel hair francese - Amazing! I had a hard time figuring out which pasta I liked more cuz they were both so yummy.Steak - Quite delicious! I couldn't enjoy this as much as i would have liked because I was so full.Broccoli - my friend raved about this one, I can see why!White fish on crackers - great way to start the meal. It was light, bright and briny. The broiled oysters were good enough but not a repeat item. I'm from Cali so I won't be back for a while, but the memories here will last a lifetime. Thank you Anton's.",0
10036,"4.5 stars. Me and my friend came here last night and shared the chvishtari (corn bread) and lula kebab with chicken. I also ordered 3 khinkali to go (2 cheese and 1 potato). Everything was marvelous. The khinkali were soft and doughey and were amazing even after staying in the fridge overnight for the next day. The cheese ones especially were great. Not runny or gooey, it was more like ravioli. While I wouldn't exactly describe it as ""corn bread,"" the corn bread was more like soft, warm bread with cheese in the center. Not corny but still wonderful. The cheese wasn't overpowering, it was just enough. The walnut dipping sauce was a great pairing to go with it! The chicken kebab was also outstanding. The sauce that came with it was so good that we asked for more, and that's the reason why I took off half a star. They gave us more sauce but charged us $3 for it without telling us beforehand. That was kinda not ok...Overall I would definitely come back to try other things on the menu, though!",0

She pointed out that biryani was fried rice, when i was staring at the menu looking for chicken n' rice for lunch. It had the right amount of spice to it. Not a cheap lunch, but the serving size allowed me to take home leftovers to stretch it for another lunch the next day. This is one of those things that taste just as good, if not better, the next day. My wife's tikka was tasty too.",0

15614,"Title: A Sushi Revelation Beyond the Hype

Initially skeptical, I ventured into this establishment amid a buzz of trend and hype, only to be completely taken by surprise. It turns out the chatter is well-deserved; their sushi is hands down the best I've ever indulged in. Each piece is a testament to freshness, crafted right before your eyes at the sushi bar and served with an immediacy that locks in flavor and texture.

The ""Trust Me"" selection—a platter of eight distinct sushi varieties—is an essential experience for any sushi aficionado who cherishes the delicacies of raw fish over the likes of a California roll. Each piece seems to dissolve effortlessly, an encounter that can only be described as sublime.

I can't leave without mentioning the crab roll—another standout dish that showcases their commitment to excellence. If you're in search of a sushi experience that truly delivers on its promise, this place is an unequivocal must-try. Their stellar offerings have not only met but exceeded expectations. 100% recommended!",1

I recently had the pleasure of visiting this charming little spot on the way to a museum and it was a delightful discovery. The coffee offered a familiar comfort, though it was quite similar to what you'd find elsewhere. However, what really set this place apart was their exceptional pastries, specifically the white chocolate pecan pastry, which was a standout. This treat struck the perfect balance between sweet and nutty, with a soft, fluffy texture that indicated expert baking.

The establishment itself is compact and seems tailored for quick visits rather than long stays, which is ideal for a busy day out. An unexpected highlight was the beautiful flooring, which added to the quaint and inviting atmosphere. If you find yourself nearby, I wholeheartedly recommend dropping in for a pastry fix—especially the white chocolate pecan one; it’s worth a visit on its own!",1
10120,Nicely made and super sweet!!! Maison Kayser is a French bakery/cafe located snug near Times Square. This location is bustling with tourists :( It was super hard to find a spot to sit and when we did eventually sit down there were too many kids running around lolDesserts are SO SWEET. I really liked the lemon tart though because the sourness balanced out the sweetness. The desserts were also more stiff than usual as if it had been out for a long time. At least it makes for good photos!,0
18713,"Title: A Vegetarian Twist on Classic Chinese Delights

As a meat-eater accompanying a vegetarian aficionado to an exclusively vegetarian/vegan Chinese joint, I approached the dining experience with a mix of curiosity and skepticism. To my delight, the restaurant excelled at reimagining traditional Chinese dishes with plant-based alternatives that nearly replicated the flavors and textures of their meat counterparts.

Standouts like the mock chicken in black pepper sauce had me double-taking, thoroughly convinced I was indulging in the real deal. The shrimp rice roll and shiu mai were both commendable, eloquently challenging my preconceived notions of plant-based cuisine. However, while the dragon roll was satisfactory, it fell short of the bar set by establishments like Shizen in San Francisco.

In conclusion, despite my deep-seated preference for classic, carnivorous dim sum, this establishment has earned a respectful nod for its convincing plant-powered renditions, leaving both me and my vegetarian friend satiated and pleasantly surprised.",1
18752,"Title: A Slice of New York Heaven at Joe's

In the quest for the quintessential New York City slice, Joe's Pizza emerges as the standard-bearer, the slice to which all others aspire. At Joe's, the magic is in the simplicity—no overzealous topping combos here, just the classic pie, done right.

During a recent Sunday Funday, I found myself unimpressed with the menu at Off The Wagon and sprinted across the street to Joe's for a half-time refuel. Opting for the ""fresh mozz"" slice—a sublime margherita—the experience was nothing short of delightful. The sauce balanced beautifully, not too sweet but full-bodied, and the fresh mozzarella was creamy and generous. What truly set this slice apart was the crust: perfectly crispy, without even a hint of the dreaded flop.

Joe's Pizza proves that when it comes to a superb New York slice, simplicity executed perfectly trumps all. A must-visit for any pizza connoisseur.",1
11980,"Title: A Few Hits, But Not Worth the Wait

I ventured into this bustling spot with high hopes, stirred by the buzz around its innovative offerings. It pains me a bit to report that while it holds its ground, only a few items truly shined.

The beverage experience was delightful. Each concoction, from the playful Ms Cutetini to the exotic Lychee reach Rich, was a refreshing adventure, particularly the CapriSun pouch drinks adorned with LED lights, a whimsical touch that stands out.

On the food front, the Truffle Mac exuded decadence in each bite, and the Korean Popcorn Chicken (KFC) carried a comforting crunch, but the rest trailed behind. The Kimchi Paella lacked the zest one craves from such a fusion, and the Peas n Pigs was unremarkable.

Be warned though, the anticipation can be jarring with the wait times. Arrive early if you're keen to explore the highs without the lows of a lengthy queue—otherwise, you might find the wait outweighs the experience.",1
14038,"Title: Quick and Affordable Breakfast in Chinatown

If you're looking for a no-frills spot for a swift breakfast in the heart of Chinatown, this cash-only eatery is worth stopping by. The service shines with kindness and efficiency, perfect for early risers in need of a quick bite. Our breakfast spread included cheung fun with shrimp and pork, hargow, a pork veggie bun, and a turnip cake. While the shrimp lacked freshness and the hargow was on the doughy side, the affordability of the meal softened the blow — a mere $14 for a meal for two. The standout was the savory turnip cake, which became the favorite of our tasting. Though it may not be a destination in itself, this spot is certainly a viable choice for those seeking a budget-friendly meal in Chinatown.",1
20144,"Title: Warm Delights at Nice Fish & Noodle House

I recently visited Nice Fish & Noodle House based on a friend's recommendation and it's safe to say it lived up to the praise. Our group decided to share a variety of dishes, with the standout being the fish and sour cabbage soup. The broth was a perfect balance of peppery heat and tang, offering comfort on a chilly day. The fish with green pepper soup, however, lacked the same depth of flavor.

While I wasn't particularly taken with the tomato broth option, my dining companions enjoyed it. I opted to add a pork chop soup to our order, which was a hit – the pork is served on the side to remain crisp, and you can season your soup to taste with the provided condiments.

For starters, don't pass up the gizzards; they’re surprisingly tender and well-seasoned. One downside was the cash-only policy, so be sure to stop at an ATM before you go. Nonetheless, Nice Fish & Noodle House is a must-visit for a heartwarming meal.",1
12670,"Title: A Delightful Spanish Gastronomic Adventure, Though a Tad Pricey

My visit to this Spanish-inspired gem was nothing short of delightful. The restaurant boasts an impeccably clean and whimsically decorated interior, bursting with great graphics and vibrant colors that create a funky yet inviting atmosphere, reminiscent of food havens like Eataly or Le District.

Opting for a late-night nibble, I embarked on a culinary tour de force. The Patatas Bravas stole the show, outshining any I've savored in Spain, thanks to the heavenly smoky and spicy sauce. Then came the chicken croquette, a symphony of creamy goodness encased in a perfectly crunchy exterior.

The liquid olives were a revelatory experience, an absolute must-try, presenting themselves as little bites of perfection. The sausage and tomato bread pairing was a split experience; the sausage didn't quite hit the mark, but the tomato bread was delectably tasty. Both the red and white gazpacho were refreshing palate pleasers, earning them a high recommendation on my list.

The evening concluded with a sweet note: divine churros dipped in warm chocolate and an ice cream drizzled with olive oil and butter orange—pure indulgence!

While the prices are on the higher side for this style of eating, the flavors and overall experience justify the expense. A highly recommended spot for anyone looking to indulge in an array of Spanish delights.",1
197,"Ordered this for delivery and came in 40 minutes on the dot! This meal was exactly what I needed during covid. Dumplings: don't underestimate its spiciness- but that's also exactly what made it so good. Fish: doesn't get any better! The fish itself was really big and had a ton of meat, and it was perfect for two people. We were able to finish it in one sitting! Would also recommend dipping the fish into the sauce surrounded, to give it more flavor. The sauce was also great with rice! Snow-pea: also great, tasted fresh. Only thing is, not sure if it's because of the current situation but it was $17 for the vegetables, which I don't recall paying that much for before? Delicious and ordered it nonetheless, was just surprised at the pricing!",0
19596,"Title: Quick Dinner Delight at Schnippers

I stopped by Schnippers for a fast casual dinner and was pleasantly surprised by the ample seating in their spacious dining area. The ordering process was a breeze—place your order at the counter, grab a number stand, and wait for a delicious meal to be brought to your table.

I decided on the Schnippers crispy chicken sandwich and was impressed with the generous portion size; so much so, that I couldn't finish it! The chicken was a highlight—crispy on the outside, succulent on the inside, and bursting with flavor.

Though I hadn't ordered a drink, the friendly staff member at the counter thoughtfully provided a complimentary fountain drink, which was a refreshing addition to my meal.

Accompanying the sandwich were thin-cut French fries—my favorite kind—cooked to crispy perfection and a perfect complement to the main dish.

Based on this delightful experience, I'm keen to return to Schnippers. Their combination of great service, tasty food, and comfortable atmosphere makes it an easy choice for a satisfying meal.",1
14263,"I recently visited a local eatery excited to try their Falafel Bowl. Despite the inviting bright green interior of the falafels, indicating the use of fresh herbs, I was left disappointed by their lack of flavor. The crisp exterior couldn't make up for the bland taste. Additionally, the rice served with the falafel was too moist, detracting from the overall texture of the dish. Thankfully, the whipped garlic sauce provided some redemption with its lightness and spicy undertone, adding much-needed flavor. The availability of take-home sauces like hot sauce and tzatziki was a plus, but not enough to encourage a return visit or to warrant a recommendation.",1
3613,"Title: A Dumpling Delight in NYC

I finally tried the much-raved-about dumplings at this local spot and they did not disappoint. Truly, they stand out as the best I've experienced in the city. The ingredients were notably fresh, from the delicate wonton casings to the savory pork and chicken filling. Every bite was pure bliss, and I could envision myself indulging in a mountain of these little pockets of joy.

Although I didn't personally order the noodles, a taste from my friend's bowl convinced me of their merit - the soup boasted a robust, yet well-balanced meaty essence. My dining companion, a repeat patron, suggested the beef noodles as a preferable choice over the lamb, noting the latter was a bit tough during this visit. He also recommended the stir-fried noodle dishes for a different but equally satisfying experience.

In short, this restaurant is a must-visit for dumpling enthusiasts and noodle lovers alike, promising flavor-packed dishes that will beckon you back for more.",1
19069,"Cocoron is a restaurant that specializes in Japanese soba of all types, whether it be cold soba, warm soba, or dipping soba. If you got a craving for these buckwheat flour-based noodles, Cocoron is the perfect spot for that, considering the wide variety in options. Personally, I would pick the dipping soba for the best of both worlds, especially when it's a cold winter day in the city, as I can dip my cold soba noodles into a steaming, hot broth mixed with various proteins and vegetables. With the dipping soba, the cold soba is served on the side while the broth is placed in a small pot that is continuously heated by a candle underneath that is lit by your server.I got the stamina dipping soba, which contains chicken meatball, sliced and minced pork, and shiitake mushrooms in a hearty, savory broth. I got the large version, which comes with slightly more soba noodles than the regular size, and this left me quite content for someone who can eat a lot. Using the large soup spoon they give you, I would place a bite-sized portion of my soba in there and dip it into the broth, so that my noodles can warm up before I slurp them along with the broth. The broth is what warms the soul, filled with umami flavor that leaves one wanting for more. I do wish it was less salty, but otherwise, the broth is the perfect complement to the noodles. If your broth ends up disappearing before you finish the noodles, the staff will be happy to provide more broth through a portable soup container they have. Besides that, the chicken meatball and pork are great as well, though I do wish there was more included.Overall, I would highly recommend Cocoron if you're craving soba and if it's cold, Cocoron is the place to warm up with a nice helping of broth, as after all, Cocoron does mean heartwarming in Japanese.Oh and it is cash only, so be prepared for that!!",0
11053,"After much anticipation, I recently dined at the Upper West Side staple sushi spot that has been on my list. The experience, unfortunately, fell short of expectations. The starter, a tuna tortilla, was disappointingly over-fried and lacked taste. Subsequent sushi orders, including nigiri, a salmon avocado roll, Bakudan roll, and Mamoya spicy tuna roll, were not memorable. The specialty rolls lacked distinction, and the nigiri was disproportionately heavy on the rice. Both flavor and fish quality did not justify the premium prices. Overall, the visit was underwhelming.",1
10188,"I would give the ramen here a 4/5 stars, and would give the service a 5/5 stars. It's not the best ramen I've ever had, but it gets the job done. I got the most popular ramen dish, the Hakata Genryu Ramen. I thought that the broth was quite delicious, but the noodles just didn't do it for me for some reason. I've been here twice already, but I'm at the point where I'm open to exploring other ramen restaurants around the area.",0
16841,"Pretty great place for some dry pot! (Havent tried the other menu items) The price is comparable, if not cheaper than Mala Project (at least dinner/weekend prices, you cant beat their lunch prices). We were relatively hungry and ended up comfortably finishing our bowl that cost $34, so about $17 (+tip) per person. I also really like how you can choose how much of whatever you want, like you do in the flushing ones, whereas at Mala Project you pay per item you choose. (For example we like a ridiculous amount of enoki so we got to tell them to add extra enoki to our basket). The quality of the foods seemed also pretty good and i was especially impressed by the quality of the vegetables (the tofu skin and wood ear were extra good). We got spicy level 3 which is honestly not spicy at all so would probably shoot for level 4 next time. The flavors themselves were really good and it had a certain depth (maybe some sort of broth or stock?) that really enhanced the flavors. Alas they dont offer noodles to put in the dry pot however so that was a little disappointing. We had:- lamb: it was in a frozen block so they couldnt get a lot of it off the block so we ended up with like three pieces of it. Was also really tough so im not sure i'd get it again- tripe, fish balls, fish fillet, oyster mushroom, cabbage, tofu pockets: pretty good- wood ear, tofu skin: reeeeally good!!One thing i'd like to mention in case they read this: service was interesting at best..i normally don't care for service as long as im able to wave someone down and get what i want in a reasonable amount of time. But there was this one asian auntie who was running around engaging in an active fight with another waitress and shouting profanity at her (presumably to do her job better) and at one point they were literally yelling at each other over another party's table. I dont know what the story is but especially considering that it wasn't busy at all when we were there, it would have been more considerate to the few diners who were there to take their disagreements elsewhere or at least resolve them later, and especially not have a screaming match in the middle of the restaurant. Additionally, the servers initially did mix up our orders when they brought our bowl to us, and we only realized because there were four items right off the bat (and who knows how many more, if not all) that were DEFINITELY not in our order. This would've been understandable if they were incredibly busy or something but there were probably five parties there, max.",0
19452,"I recently had the pleasure of trying the Magherita Slice at a spot that's clearly taken a page from Di Fara's book - both in style and taste. The pizza did not disappoint; the freshness of the ingredients shone through in every bite. While the prices are somewhat steep, a symptom of Chelsea Market's touristy evolution, it's a worthwhile indulgence for any true pizza aficionado.",1
14754,"Title: High Expectations Dashed at Upscale Eatery

Unfortunately, my recent visit to this much-talked-about restaurant left me profoundly disappointed. Despite the premium pricing of the menu, the quality of the dishes did not measure up.

The Grilled Shrimp appetizer was mediocre at best, although the creative garnish was a pleasant touch. Moving on to the Black Cod, it was a letdown with an overly fatty and surprisingly flavorless presentation — a stark contrast to the delicious cod I'm accustomed to enjoying elsewhere.

Crispy Duck Dumplings also failed to impress. The shredded duck was unappealingly dry, and the accompanying sauce lacked depth. While I didn't mind the dish due to my affinity for fried foods, my companion found it unsatisfactory.

The Fish Tacos were another sore point: at $16 for two, the scant amount of fish wrapped in a soft, soggy batter that disintegrated easily was far from the expectations set by the price.

On a positive note, the Black Ant Negroni cocktail was a standout, thoroughly enjoyable and the singular highlight of the meal.

Service-wise, there's room for improvement. Our waitress, albeit sweet, seemed more engaged with her own activities or in conversation with coworkers than attending to our needs, resulting in neglected drink orders and a lack of attention to basic details like refilling water.

The experience culminated in a substantial bill exceeding $200 that, given the poor quality and service, felt unjustified. It's regrettable, but I cannot recommend this establishment based on this disheartening experience.",1
15299,"Had brunch here with a friend for the first time. Wait was short for a Sunday. It's a little loud as it's a sports bar and the football game was on. I ordered the Berry Bellini and Eggs Benedict with ham. My friend ordered a Mimosa and Huevos Rancheros. Pretty typical dishes for brunch and they were good. Had an uncomfortable experience when I asked for hot sauce. The man I asked-who had been standing behind the host stand for a long time and walked past my table, responded to my request with-and I quote ""How dare you. I don't work here!"" Then stared me down. This was extremely uncomfortable. The man then laughed and said ""I'm just kidding, I'm the manager. What kind of hot sauce?"" This wasn't funny-you don't insult people who bring money to your establishment, and as a manager you should know better. My friend was also put off by this. We won't be coming back.",0
12154,"Title: High Hopes Dashed by Mediocrity

Entering the highly praised burger joint, my expectations were sky-high, only to be met with a stark reality check. Priced steeply at $12 to $15 per burger, the value proposition was less than convincing. The burger itself was merely adequate, failing to deliver that special flare one would anticipate with such a price tag, and to my disappointment, it arrived without the customary side of fries.

The truffle fries, while undeniably delectable at $7, did little to offset the sting of the cost, despite their savory allure. Luckily, a Groupon lessened the financial burden, allowing me to enjoy two burgers and an order of truffle fries for a more palatable $20.

However, devoid of the coupon, it's doubtful I would elect to dine here again. There seems to be more sizzle than steak—or rather, more buzz than bun—at this establishment.",1

20356,Tried their restaurant week menu for lunch which is similar to their normal menu with fewer options. Got the spicy k.f.c wings and the poke dup bap. Wings were delicious with a good amount of spice! I really enjoyed that. The poke bowl was pretty standard but I did like the sauce they used. Portions are fair as well. We also made a reservation and I guess only the bar was available. However didn't look like the place was full and there were lots of empty tables while we were dining. Overall pretty decent place with intimate ambiance.,0
20645,"My Libra friend had trouble deciding how she wanted to celebrate her birthday with her large group of friends last month - she just knew she wanted pizza in the LES so that she could go out afterwards. I suggested Pizza Beach to her weeks in advance, as I've walked past this restaurant/bar numerous times which always gave off fun, basic b*tch vibes with its coral blue decor and al fresco seating. We were hesitant on reserving for our table of 10, however, since we'd have to put down a credit card and we're both afraid of commitment.Fast forward to her birthday where our group of 10 traveled down from midtown, finally deciding to go to this spot and praying that they'd be able to accommodate us. It was a Saturday night, around 10:30pm so it really could've gone either way. Thankfully they did indeed have a table available and we were sat almost immediately! It was pretty busy and loud, with people drinking at the bar and other tables around us also enjoying pizzas. Not overwhelmingly crowded, but the perfectly fun atmosphere we were looking for. There was a projector screening Point Break to add to the beach vibes but it got a lil too intense.Half the table ordered cocktails, and I believe we ordered a personal pizza for every two people to share (5 pies total). I tried the Maui (the one w/ pineapple, controversial) and the Talum (w/ avocado, interesting) - both good, but nothing spectacular. I had pretty low expectations for the food here, so I couldn't be disappointed and it turned out to be what I had expected - overpaying for just-ok food. But again, the birthday girl wanted pizza and a fun time and alas that's what we got. The restaurant brought out a vanilla sorbet (?) with a candle on it at the very end, which we were all surprised about, especially the bday girl -- not sure who told them but that was super nice of them!The bill came out to approx $24-$25 per person including tax + tip... that's cheap for the ones that drank, but pretty expensive for the ones that had only a half of a personal pie. They take a maximum of 4 cards so we decided to put down 2 to split, with everyone else paying the cardholders back. I have to say this got pretty awkward even though this is expected when it comes to large groups and it's not the restaurant's fault at all. To help relieve the group awkwardness though, I'd suggest the restaurant to invest in those handheld tablets that I've seen at other places (Catch NYC, Fogo de Chao, etc.) where the bill can be split many ways and the customers can choose the amount they want to pay... TLDR: if you care about fun ambiance/vibes more than the food/costs, this is the spot. (Not cheap mediocre pizza) Good for groups and basic b*tches.",0

Told of a 20-minute wait, we descended to Little Cheval, the charismatic bar beneath, where bartenders with reality-show potential served up boozy milkshakes that were a delight to carry back upstairs.

When seated, the burger demanded our attention. Mistakenly modest in name, the 'single' boasts a double patty delight.

My boyfriend and I had a memorable Sunday lunch at [Restaurant Name], a haven for dry pot enthusiasts. Diners can customize their pots by selecting from an array of ingredients, each categorically priced from seafood to veggies. Accompanied by delightful purple rice, a personal favorite, the experience was both unique and satisfying.

I opted for a mild spice level—perfect for those with a lower spice tolerance—while my spicy-food-loving boyfriend relished his fiery version. Standout toppings included enoki and wood ear mushrooms, crunchy lotus root, succulent beef tenderloin, tender squid, and the uncommon yet delicious cheese-filled fish cake.

Beyond my favorites, the beef baby rib, roe-filled fish balls, pig kidney, and scallops were top-notch. The range of options didn't stop there; with unique offerings like soup-filled beef balls, frog legs, fried gluten balls, and various noodles, the menu definitely catered to diverse palates.

The restaurant's interior was spacious and aesthetically pleasing, adorned with subtle Chinese décor, creating an ideal ambiance for any occasion—be it a friendly gathering, a romantic date, or a family meal. Plus, they accept reservations, making your planning easier.

11784,"TLDR: New Singaporean restaurant in the Flat Iron area. Pricey but a lot of variety. Might depend on which dishes you order.Came here with my cousin and tried to get a few things from everything. The restaurant itself is very nice and has comfortable seating. We were seated towards the back of the restaurant. The lighting from the semi-open kitchen (window) threw the ambiance a bit off.The Iced Malaysian White Coffee was very tasty. That nice creaminess was awesome with the coffee where the beans stand out.We were going to try the crab special but at $70, that's a bit much. We tried the following small plates:Salty Egg Prawns - I was really excited for this and especially based on reviews. It was a bit too sweet for me and while this traditionally rich dish, I felt this was bit too rich. The prawns are large but it is also an expensive dish at $28.Calamari Singapura - Favorite thing I had at this meal. Crispy calamari, crispy rice, lots of spice.. awesome. Think of a new school salt & pepper squid. Loved this.Crispy Chicken Wings - Solid but chicken wings are chicken wings.For the main dishes we got:Rendang Beef - This is always a favorite of mine at any Southeast Asian restaurant. The sauce was fine but the meat was too dry. It reminded me of BBQ brisket where it breaks apart like it's shredded.Kang Kung - Water spinach fried in a wok with shrimp paste. Very enjoyable.Kway Teow with Chicken - Second favorite thing. While I've had this a lot, this one actually had some good heat to it. That lovely charred soy sauce taste and spice.I'd say half the dishes I enjoyed and half of them were underwhelming. Overall, I liked it enough that I'd come back. Order the same favorites as last time and try some more items on the menu.",0

I recently had the pleasure of dining at this gem of a restaurant with three friends following a workout. Despite its bustling atmosphere, the sound levels were pleasantly manageable, and our group was promptly seated upon arrival - a testament to the restaurant's excellent logistics.

The service deserves a standing ovation; it was nothing short of impeccable. Attentive without being overbearing, the staff ensured our water glasses never ran dry and that each dish graced our table at just the right temperature.

Our hunger led us to order a smorgasbord of offerings from their extensive menu, rendering it a blur of culinary delight. However, the bacon-wrapped Brussels sprouts and the golden roll were standout dishes, leaving a memorable imprint on our taste buds with their delectable flavors.

All told, this dining experience was a delightful affair that has left me eager to return and explore more of their diverse menu. A definite must-visit for anyone looking for great food with equally great service!",1
18776,"People usually ended up eating somewhere because of a long wait here at Ramen Lab, while we came here when there were no more tables at Wayan. Even then, we still waited for about half an hour. Wait can be longer for party of 3 or 4.

When you're almost next,  the host will start taking your order. BBQ Rib Ramen in Shoyu for me last night. It has roasted corn, scallions, nori and pickled tomatillo. Pickled tomatillo in a Ramen broth, you say? I know,  I raised my left eyebrow, too. But I understood the rationale after taking a whole bite of it. It was necessary to cut the richness of the tenderest rib, you'll ever have.  The pickled tomatillo was a clever idea; it was the acid that would balance the pork broth. This silky broth coated their even silkier noodles(and probably my coronary arteries!), sho yu slurp with gusto. One of the best ramens I've had!",0
19473,"Upon my initial visit to this innovative restaurant, I was unaware of its unique concept involving a rotation of chefs, giving it the feel of a continuous pop-up event. While intriguing, such a model can leave the service lagging behind that of more traditional establishments, with the staff not quite hitting the mark of excellence.

During a subsequent evening, my husband and I attended a night spotlighting Israeli chefs. He was thoroughly impressed with the culinary offerings, while I found the dishes to be just slightly above Manhattan's already high standards. Considering the hefty $200 expense for just two people, which included a mere single glass of wine, the meal left both my wallet and appetite somewhat unsatisfied. The high cost of wines did little to enhance the value proposition.

In essence, while the concept is a novel draw, the overall experience may only resonate with patrons specifically interested in the chef of the evening, as the value for money leaves something to be desired.",1

With an extensive menu and tempting happy hour deals, their appetizer platter caught my eye. The curry puff, though a tad chewy, boasted delectable flavors, while the special sauce BBQ chicken leaned toward a honey soy profile – enjoyable, if not exceptional. The Thai spring rolls were flavorful, but slightly overdone on the edges; still, they're worth a second try.

1233,"Tucked away in the bustling Chelsea Market, this gem of a restaurant proves itself worthy of braving the throngs. Though crowds can be daunting, a weekday visit rewards with a much better chance of securing a seat. For weekend warriors wary of the wait, the mouthwatering takeout option is a fail-safe.

My inaugural visit was a Monday lunch with my mom, where the patience game paid off with a vacated table just in time. Our menu picks: a cauliflower pita, a chicken pita, and an extra serving of pita because, let's face it, carbs are our friends. Mid-meal, the roasted cauliflower became an irresistible add-on. And rightly so – the pitas were pillowy havens for flavor, the cauliflower was a roasted revelation, and the chicken could only be described as succulently spun. While tahini is available, I went all-in with a bold move: diving into a full bowl of their zesty green spicy sauce. Each bite was a flavor fest.

In a nutshell, this spot is a delight for the taste buds, and I wholeheartedly recommend giving it a go. Whether you're a fan of spice, a lover of well-crafted pitas, or simply in pursuit of beautifully roasted bites, this place won't disappoint.",1
16456,"Title: A Little Slice of Italy in Hell's Kitchen at Tavola

If you're yearning for authentic Italian cuisine amidst the busy streets of New York City, Tavola is a gem waiting to be discovered. Tucked away from the hectic tourist hotspots of Times Square, this charming eatery serves up a delightful array of regional Italian dishes, with a focus on Puglian, Roman, and Sicilian flavors.

The heart of Tavola's culinary prowess lies in its two wood-burning ovens, both handcrafted in Naples. One is dedicated to crafting perfect Neapolitan pizzas, while the other roasts meats, fish, and vegetables to smoky perfection. As a repeat visitor, I find myself continuously impressed with the consistently delicious food, the attentive service, and the relaxed atmosphere that makes dining here a pleasure.

During my last visit, I savored the Insalata Mista—a fresh mix of organic mesclun, herbs, tomato, and cucumber—as well as the delectable Rice Balls Risotto with both veal and shrimp. The entrees, Orechiette with Esposito's Luganica Sausage and Broccoli Rabe, and the Rigatoni Bolognese with a rich wild boar and veal meat sauce, were impeccable in both flavor and preparation.

For anyone seeking a great Italian meal and an escape from the average tourist dining experience, Tavola is a definite must-visit. They accept reservations through the Yelp App, making it even easier to secure a spot at this culinary haven. Whether it's a leisurely lunch or a dinner to fuel a night in the city, Tavola's kitchen is sure to impress.",1
20327,"Root and Bone truly stands out as a culinary gem in the city, a must-visit for locals and tourists alike. Their fried chicken is a revelation, possibly the best you’ll ever taste. With a perfectly crunchy exterior bursting with flavor and an unexpectedly moist interior, a half chicken barely satisfies – you’ll find yourself wishing you had gone for the whole bird. The biscuits, too, are extraordinary, complemented by a finger-licking gravy that leaves you savoring every last drop. As for the Mac and cheese, it's a cheesy, gooey masterpiece that can only be described as amazing. Root and Bone delivers comfort food at its finest.",1
14791,"Title: Mixed Feelings at TEISUI - A Dim Omakase Experience

My visit to TEISUI, although anticipated with excitement, left much to be desired. Expecting an exceptional omakase experience, my friend and I opted for the priciest option at $85 each, which, with tax and tip, brought our total to $200. Prompt seating at the sushi counter upon our Saturday 7pm reservation was a plus, but that’s where the highlights began to dim.

The ambiance of TEISUI is chic and modern with a dimly lit setting, reminiscent of Sushi Nakazawa, yet the vibe was oddly casual with a top 40 playlist in the background.

The omakase itself was a rollercoaster: the sushi was generally good, with standout pieces like the uni and sturgeon caviar, salmon ikura and uni bowl, mackerel, Oh-toro Tuna, and Chu-toro Tuna. Yet, some offerings such as the amberjack, spotted prawns, and akami tuna were just okay—nothing remarkable.

Service, unfortunately, added to the disappointment. The chef’s lack of engagement and storytelling, a staple in other omakase experiences that enriches the dining ritual, was sorely missed. We craved the narratives behind each piece that other venues provide, enhancing the enjoyment and understanding of the meal.

Moreover, the two appetizers we started with - squid and tuna tartare - were forgettable, with the squid being overly acidic and the tartare appearing unappetizing. An unexpected crunch in the hand roll, presumably from bamboo shoots, felt out of place.

I also can’t help but feel shortchanged; despite selecting the top-tier omakase, it seemed we missed out on some of the ""special"" rolls that others had raved about, like the wagyu roll, which we were not served.

Overall, TEISUI was one of my less favored omakase experiences in NYC. While there were some high notes, the incomplete feeling left by both the food and service is hard to overlook. There are other venues like Sushi on Jones, Sushi by Bae/Bou, and Sushi Yasaka that offer a more comprehensive and enriching omakase at a much better value. Unless TEISUI makes an effort to rectify the lackluster meal, my search for sublime sushi continues elsewhere.",1
2125,"They have a buy one get one free promotion on their ramen for their month of October so it was perfect for a broke college student like me. Their normal ramen prices can be found on their website but it's about $12-16. The place was a walkable distance from Baruch College. The place is pretty spacious so I don't think it's a very well known place, despite how good their food is. The whole experience was pretty much self serve. You get your own utensils and water at the counter yourself. They have really thick napkins. My ramen was ready for pick up in about 15 minutes. They have high chairs with a ledge to eat on that best suited customers that came alone but they also had actual tables to eat at too if you're coming with a group of friends. You can choose where to seat yourself. The ramen was pretty good. I loved the egg. It was a bit sweet. I ate the Ma- Yu Ramen (black garlic oil). I would definitely get that again since that's my go-to flavor. My friend ate the spicy miso ramen and her nose got runny because of how spicy it is. After our ramen, we checked in for a small free cup of gelato. I've been dying to try the white rabbit flavor but I just never had the opportunity to get it anywhere else. It definitely tasted like the white rabbit candy. My friend got the rose lychee flavor and she said it was too sweet for her and that she wouldn't get that flavor again. They also had lemon cookie flavor which looked pretty interesting. Their flavors rotate so for example, they didn't have Ube flavor the day I went. I was too busy trying to take a picture of the gelato for my ice cream, it melted and got all over my hands within 7 minutes. Luckily, the staff member provided me with an abundant amount of napkins so kudos to them. Overall, I definitely recommend this spot for those in the area trying to eat with privacy. Unlike Shake Shack, this place was pretty low key and spacious. I didn't bump into anybody at all. It's definitely on the more expensive side if you're not getting the ramen on their BOGO month but hey, free gelato with a check in! The main dish you purchase + the free gelato will definitely be worth the price you paid.",0

However tonight was carefully coordinated with another couple and we couldn't have picked a better place. Everything was excellent from the moment we walked in. A well groomed host (Richie) greeted us immediately and directed us to the dining area. Where the waiter promptly took our order and drinks and food began to flow soon after.

1352,"Had the best NYE meal here! The staff and owner were so incredibly warm and welcoming. We were greeted with NYE necklaces and hats and complimentary champagne. Additionally, they gave us 12 grapes to celebrate the Spanish New Year which was so much fun. We ordered the following dishes:- Meat and cheese platter- Patatas Bravas- Vegetable Paella (special)- Gambas San Martin- Pomegranate SangriaOverall, food was solid, but the paella and shrimp could have used more seasoning. The sangria was tasty but was a bit on the watery side. Moreover, if you have a party of more than 4 people, this place may be a bit cramped. Nonetheless, the atmosphere and service was so amazing, and it was still a 5 star experience.",0

Their ability to serve up a tasty GF waffle is impressive and consistently wins over my international guests in search of a healthier brunch. While generally a satisfying experience, their coffee and cappuccinos could benefit from a stronger brew, as they recently seemed watered down. Compliments to the attentive and friendly staff who enhance the dining experience with their exceptional service.",1
13001,"Visited this spot recently and sampled their cheese burger, teriyaki chicken, and spicy salmon rolls, along with an iced matcha. The concept of a cheese burger roll intrigued me, though the meat turned out overdone and chewy. The teriyaki chicken roll was a standout with its exceptionally tender meat—definitely my top pick. The spicy salmon roll delivered on the heat, yet it was nothing extraordinary.

As for the drinks, I'd suggest passing on the iced matcha; it was disappointingly watery and lacked the characteristic matcha flavor. Overall, for the rolls alone, this place merits a solid 4 out of 5. Just steer clear of the matcha.",1
16483,"Great place for brunch! We originally wanted to go to a different place but the wait was an hour so we looked up a near by option & Cornerstone Cafe popped up. Great food. I ordered a omelette where you choose your own fillings. I picked Asiago cheese & spinach. The omelette was very well cooked. My two sides of fruit & mixed greens were tasty. My only complaint is they don't warn you about the additional costs. I ordered a croissant which was $0.50 more than a regular piece of toast and was charged for a $4 avocado when I didn't ask for one. Besides that, service was great.",0
12858,"My partner and I saw tuome online and thought it was a cool (but also weird) concept to incorporate traditional American food with Chinese food, so we decided to stop by for dinner one night. The service wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. We walked in and it was packed that night, so we were told that we would have to wait. That wasn't a problem. I would have liked for the waitress to be more attentive, though. It was like she took our order, brought our food, and that was it. She wasn't around when we needed more drinks or wanted to order more food. The food on the other hand was very yummy. The deviled eggs were breaded and crispy, and I can say confidently that they were some of the best deviled eggs I've ever had. The seafood dish I ordered was too yummy! It was creamy and packed with flavor. The chef was not shy on the amount of seafood they put in, too!Besides the waitress that went missing, I'd go back for everything!",0

Was my second time here I figured I might give it another shot in case they improved but NO. That was it for me.",0
2298,"I was with some friends at an event in Terminal 5 and we got hungry after it ended. Since it was about 11pm, our options for food were limited. We quickly yelped a spot and found American Retro was open late. We braced the cold as we walked here and hoped that the kitchen was open.. and indeed it was!They had a full menu and we decided to share a bunch of appetizers/fingerfood. We got the pulled pork quesadilla, beef sliders, pizza tots and onion rings. The quesadilla was pretty hefty and came with a lot of ingredients and overall pretty filling. The beef sliders were surprisingly very good and the buns were nicely toasted. The pizza tots were tater tots mixed with marinara sauce and cheese on top. It was interesting for sure but got soggy rather quickly. I would've preferred if the marinara sauce was on the side instead. The onion rings were delicious and made perfectly.They're stocked with a full bar so you can order whatever drink you want. They also have a small area in the back for beer pong or if you have a private party. Overall, it was a great find and I'll definitely be back if I'm in the area.",0

Naoki also has a great sake selection. I, for one, loved their Plum sake.Staff is very, very nice. They will call you ahead of time to make sure you're coming and yes, you will have to provide your credit card.",0
16026,"Title: A Delectable Feast at Boqueria – A Pricey but Worthwhile Indulgence

Boqueria is a culinary gem offering an impressive array of dishes that tantalize the palate. During my recent visit, the highlights were the meat and cheese platter, paired with standout offerings like the lusciously tender escalivada and mouth-watering croquettes – both of which are non-negotiable reorders for any future visits. The meats on the platter were exceptional, overshadowing the cheeses, which, while satisfactory, were not as memorable.

Patatas bravas and calamari were competent additions to the meal, but in hindsight, they were perhaps unnecessary; the portion sizes at Boqueria are generous, and these dishes tipped us into the realm of overindulgence. However, they could be perfect for those with heartier appetites or larger groups.

Pricing at Boqueria leans towards the steep side, making it more of a treat than a regular haunt. Still, for the quality and flavors experienced, I deem it worth the splurge for special occasions or when the craving for Spanish cuisine strikes.",1
1654,"Heading to The Jones feels like stepping into the epicenter of millennial buzz, a place that's been stirring up the media lately. With curiosity piqued, I decided to give their menu a try, specifically their take on the classic filet-o-fish sandwich. Let's cut to the chase: it's reminiscent of the fast-food staple, but it comes with a gourmet price tag that's about $16 steeper—food for thought.

The ambiance? Comfortingly homey, blurring the lines between a café and someone's living room. Amidst the casual vibe, you'll notice quite a few patrons camped out with laptops, turning dining tables into makeshift offices. It seems The Jones isn't just serving dishes; it's dishing out a space for work and leisure, too.",1
20611,"Title: A Convenient Pre-Theater Dinner at Marseilles

My dining experience at Marseilles was precisely what my boyfriend and I needed for a satisfying meal before catching an off-broadway show. Despite not having a reservation, we were pleasantly accommodated as walk-ins.

Admittedly, the sticker shock from the midtown cocktail prices gave me pause, but the L'orange sanguine cocktail I sipped on turned out to be quite refreshing. For starters, the Honey nut squash risotto was a delightfully shared appetizer. The true star of the night, however, was the Steak frites, featuring perfectly cooked Angus hanger steak – a dish I'd heartily recommend. The accompanying Marseille salad was a fresh counterpoint to the rich main.

We wrapped up our meal with the classic crème brûlée. It was exceptional, with a perfectly caramelized top that gave way to a creamy, vanilla-infused custard that ended our meal on a high note. Marseilles proved to be a solid choice for a decent dinner, especially when in a pinch for time before a show.",1
19998,"I found this place when looking for a restaurant that didn't have a line with a thirty minute wait, and I'm so glad I did! This place was very casual and had delicious sandwiches.

Just a casual great place for a delicious meal, without any frills.",0
11269,"I came in on Friday late afternoon and the line wasn't obscenely long. I waited maybe 15-20 mins. I came here because the friend I was with highly suggested it and said she always comes here when she's in NY (we're from SoCal). I ordered the vodka sauce pizza and their pepperoni. The vodka was my favorite, it was soooo good. The pepperoni was also really good. The pepperoni is so flavorful and they put an incredibly generous portion of it on the pizza, so much that I had to take some off. I definitely would love to come back if I ever return to the city.",0
2088,5 stars for service.   The line wasn't horrible but it was still back to the curtain.  I went with my 5 year old daughter and we waited a few minutes but she was getting impatient (we had just walked from w 86th through the park).  We got off the line when someone from behind the counter yelled to me to find out why I was leaving.  He called me to the front and said don't leave.  He let us cut the line and man did my daughter feel VIP.  We took the food to go and walked home.  Cheeseburger with pickles and fries.  Wow these were great burgers.  Cooked medium with a great taste.  I had this place on my list for awhile but I've never wanted to wait on the line.  Well next time I'll be happy to wait and maybe even let someone go ahead of me for some extra burger karma.,0
2779,"Title: Flatiron's New Shanghainese Spot Falls Short

I headed to the new Shanghainese restaurant in Flatiron with high hopes, but left disappointed. The much-anticipated soup dumplings missed the mark, lacking the signature broth and presenting a taste profile that was underwhelming. The consistency of the pork filling was off - dry and bland. Their take on Grandma's braised pork was passable; however, the pork's fatty parts were not rendered long enough, which compromised the dish's texture.

The service and ambiance didn't offset the culinary letdowns. While these aspects were satisfactory, it's the food that I came for and, unfortunately, it didn't live up to my expectations. An additional quibble - the bill suggested tips calculated post-tax, which seems a tad inconsiderate. I'm not inclined to revisit given the overall experience.",1
14704,"Title: A Scenic Culinary Delight at Hudson Yards

My recent lunch experience at this gem on the 5th floor of Hudson Yards shops was nothing short of exceptional. Its prime location offers breathtaking views of the Hudson River, especially enchanting during sunset, which only enhances the dining experience.

The culinary journey began with appetizing starters, notably the lobster and shrimp dim sum, and the Yellowfin tuna crudo, both of which were fresh and flavorful. The main course, a Black Angus bovette, was a standout with its succulence and tastiness, complemented by roasted potatoes and a modest serving of greens. The pairing with a Cecchi Chianti Classico elevated the meal further.

Service was top-notch - prompt, attentive, and warm - completing the fine dining experience. It's a definite recommendation for an exquisite meal against the backdrop of one of the city's finest views.",1
13502,"Title: A Hidden Gem for Hearty Eats

Don't let the modest exterior fool you - this place is the real deal! My food-savvy friend raved about their cheap yet delicious offerings and she wasn't wrong. Take note: it's cash-only here, and seating is sparse. But that's part of the charm. Embrace the opportunity to cozy up with strangers or enjoy your meal in blissful solitude.

The service is commendable, with our hostess radiating warmth, though my lack of Mandarin meant my friend did the talking, adding to the authentic experience. We feasted on pork noodles and fresh greens, both simple and exceptionally tasty. The portions are generous to a fault; I couldn't manage to clean my plate.

If you're looking for an unpretentious spot with satisfying, wallet-friendly fare, look no further. Just remember the date for future reference: 187 out of 2019!",1

It's refreshing to find a tasty yet somewhat healthy option among the usual choices. Although the meat in the taco salad didn't quite hit the mark for me, the fish tacos were delightful. Additionally, the wheat flour tortilla was a surprisingly tasty touch that I thoroughly enjoyed. Highly recommended for those seeking a quick, satisfying meal.",1

Every location delivers the same consistency in quality, ambiance, and service - it's really incredible how they've managed to do this.

Only gripe is there's only one bathroom for the entire restaurant, so even with only three other tables full a line formed quickly.",0

2564,"Title: A Cut Above the Rest - Exquisite Indian Cuisine Experience!

Review:
My dining experience at this Indian restaurant was nothing short of exceptional - arguably the best Indian fare I've had to date, and I consider myself quite the connoisseur after frequenting numerous spots in Manhattan and NJ. The moment you step inside, you sense you're in for something special. The ambiance strikes the perfect balance between modern chic and welcoming warmth.

While awaiting our table, we indulged in the sweet creaminess of their mango lassis at the bar. Restaurant week meant a set lunch menu, which did not disappoint from the get-go. The starters - succulent prawns and flavorful chicken - set a high bar, promptly met by the main course, the mango cod, which was a heavenly blend of sweet and savory. Not only was every bite a delight, but the prices were also surprisingly reasonable.

Couple the culinary excellence with the attentive service we received, and it's clear why a return visit isn't just a possibility, but a certainty. Highly recommended for anyone seeking an unrivaled Indian dining experience!",1

We tried the pork soup dumpling and the chicken dumpling. Both the fillings were pretty decent, but the skin was super thick and heavy. Towards the end I was leaving out the skin and just eating the filling, as thick and chewy skin is a total dealbreaker for me when it comes to dumplings. Definitely not the worst dumplings, but could use work. - Navya J@nyconthetable",0

I got the vegetarian one and itsmostly mushroom stuffing. It was really good! $12 and small so it's a good appetizer but the dumpling is thick so it actually satisfied me stomach. They give u a metal straw to drink the soup inside. I also got the wheat dough salad! Highly recommend. It was seitan, mushrooms, asparagus and other things. Very textured and flavorful. A fun appetizer. The orange chicken is not breaded and there are no veggies in the dish. It was simple and good! No complaints there. The five elements tea was so herbal fruity and sweet. I liked it I wish it wasn't as sweet though. The presentation of the tea and cups was memorable. My fav part were the seats we sat in. Oh my comfy.",0

The restaurant is supposed to replicate eating out side in the Korean country side market. Food choices are definitely delicious. Im a big fan of the cheesy corn, kimchi rice, and pork stuffed squid. They are my go to. The cheesy corn is great appetizer to mix with any entree. The kimchi rice is topped off with a fried egg, so delicious. The pork stuff squid is so fresh and spicy, I absolutely love it. Drinks are incredible, I'm a big fan of the watermelon soju bowl. Its a half sliced watermelon filled with watermelon soju goodness. I highly recommend getting this if you in a big group of ppl (or 3 ppl). You can do other fruits too. Overall I always have a great experience here, they go all out for birthdays, amazing place to celebrate it. I would give this place 5 stars but the payment thing sucks. I give 4 stars because they don't accept visa, just master card, amex or discover.",0
11780,"Tucked away in an unassuming ""basement"" between two Korean eateries, this gem is easy to miss—keep your eyes peeled for the stairs leading down to culinary delight. Once inside, we were greeted by a trio of entrees that boasted freshness and flavor in every bite, though note that one dish did lag behind the others in its arrival. The hostess's sake recommendation complemented our meal beautifully and was fairly priced, enhancing the overall experience. For an unconventional sweet ending, we opted for edamame, a choice that did not disappoint. We're already planning our return visit.",1
12327,"During Restaurant Week, my lunch experience at this establishment proved to be quite the culinary delight. While the current special has been scaled back to two courses, excluding dessert, this did not detract from the quality or quantity of the offerings. The octopus appetizer was notably generous in size, fresh, and perfectly succulent. As for the mains, the branzino was a standout, and the linguini in clam sauce was an exceptional celebration of seafood, all at an excellent value.

However, the service experience did have a slight hiccup. Upon arrival for my 12:15pm reservation, I was unexpectedly kept waiting for a couple of minutes while a later-arriving party was seated ahead of us. Although it was a brief delay, it felt dismissive, especially when on a tight lunch break schedule.

Regardless of the minor service issue, the quality of the seafood dishes alone is a compelling reason to recommend a visit.",1

I love everything about the restaurant-- authentic Korean cuisine and simple interior design, who wouldn't be a fan?I particularly love their bento box main dishes. I've tried their bulgogi and galbi bowls with salad, pickled daikon and beets, roasted potatoes, and purple rice. One bowl is more than enough for a casual meal, with a high chance of leftovers for next time. Also, their butternut squash soup is a super yummy side dish.",0

14715,"Really wanted to like this place but it fell really flat.We were looking for a place to eat on new years day, so a lot of places were closed. We called to make sure they were open, and when we arrived, there was only one party there. The place is super cute and cozy, dimly lit with nice relaxing music in the background, and the one party that was there were Japanese, so I had high hopes! Lots of space too, the restaurant extends all the way to the back where there are several tables.As a lot of people mention in their reviews, there is only one person in the kitchen (which is an amazing feat but sucks when it's busy!), and from what I saw that day, only one server as well (not sure if it was because it was new years or what). The server wasn't the warmest of all people so I thought they lacked on the service side, especially for a Japanese restaurant (they are usually EXTRA nice and courteous!). Anyway, they have a regular menu and then a today's special menu. Everything seems pretty affordable at first, but I have heard from other reviews that the portions are insanely tiny. We decided to go with their $35 tasting menu, which consists of 5 dishes, it sounded like the best option for the best value!First dish: appetizers of seaweed, edamame, and potato salad. Nothing special, very small portions. Literally 5 edamame pods, and completely bland in flavor. Potato salad really lacked the sweetness that most japanese potato salads have, which comes from the mayo!Second dish: Beef/Potato stew (Nikujaga). This dish was actually pretty good, not too salty and had the right amount of richness to it, but it was mostly potato chunks and very very very small and lean sliced pieces of beef on the bottom. It also came out lukewarm, which is super terrible in my book.Third dish: One spring roll. This is the only dish I didn't get a picture of, but it looks like a regular deep fried spring roll. I think it was slightly undercooked or maybe the wrapper was too thick because some of the outer ring of the wrapper was a little mushy. Couldn't really taste what was in the filling :( I would have much preferred something like a Gyoza (people have said it was good!), rice ball, or Karaage, which is more typical of Japanese bar food.Fourth dish: tender pork belly. This is their famous dish. Pretty sizable chunk and it was decently tender! But I can't believe this is $22 on their regular menu, I hope it's a much larger portion size!Fifth Dish: Goto Udon. A special udon from goto island in agedashi fish broth. I thought the broth was actually pretty darn delicious and full of flavor, but the noodles were really bleh. Didn't really pick up any flavor from the broth, and didn't have enough of a bite. Not sure if this was freshly made noodles or just noodles from a package, but it tasted like the latter.We also got two hot sake bottles, and they were $13 each I think, pretty steep! I think we paid over $100 for both of us, and it might not sound like a crazy amount, but I didn't think the food was really that great unfortunately. So much potential to be a great place though.",0

A nightly special of a whole Spanish mackerel grilled with herbs, sprouts and figs: OUTSTANDING (it was also easily enough for 2 to share, but I managed). Baked items including rustic loaves for dinner and crostatas for brunch are world class. Porchetta is at least the equal of any I've had in Tuscany and Umbria. The menu is small, but there are quite a few specials -- enough to make the choices still rather difficult.",0
1200,"Came here with a group of girlfriends on a Friday night. Made a reservation which is a good idea because it's a small place and it gets filled up! The decor is interesting - kind of a modern romantic look with floral wallpaper and fake crystal chandeliers. Would be a nice place for a date. We started off with some of the cockatils from the menu. I tried the muddler (vodka, basil, strawberry) that was pretty good. For the food, we started by ordering the Italian Flag for the table which was a classic tomato and mozzarella dish with a side of balsamic vinagrette. The mozzarella was very fresh and delicious. They also brought out a bread basket that I loved. For the mains, we got the tasty crustacean, the special of the day - a lobster ravioli, and the little ears of apulia. The dishes are a good portion size. The tasty crustacean was definitely a hit with a good size piece of lobster on a brandy cream tonnarelli pasta.The only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of the 5 was because the service wasn't great. We had to wait a long time to give our drink and then food order and throughout the evening it was hard to get our waiters attention. Plus they were a little overeager to take away our appetizer plates and utensils. We then had nothing to put the bread on. Overall, the food here is excellent italian and the pasta is definitely a highlight. Their menu is varied enough that there will have something for everyone and it would be good for a small group or a date.",0
1804,"My recent dining experience left me quite disillusioned with the establishment. Service fell short of expectations, with over a 30-minute wait for drinks and a persistent struggle to capture the staff's attention. The meal itself was underwhelming, marred by excess oil and a lack of flavor. Regrettably, I cannot recommend this restaurant.",1
18547,"Title: A Hidden Gem for Hot Pot Lovers

I recently stumbled upon an amazing find — a modern and authentic Chinese hot pot restaurant that somehow hasn't been the talk of the town yet, and I can't understand why! The interior is chic and inviting, setting the stage for a delightful dining experience.

The staff were incredibly welcoming, enhancing the overall atmosphere with their friendly and attentive service. The restaurant was spotlessly clean, comfortable, and the lighting was just perfect for a cozy meal.

My friend and I opted for the all-you-can-eat hot pot, and it was a revelation. We chose the double herbal and spicy mala broths — each bringing a unique and flavorful twist that stood out from other hot pot places we've tried.

Our spread was generous, featuring multiple types of beef, lamb, an array of veggies including sweet, fresh corn, enoki mushrooms, tofu variations, tender chicken dumplings, distinctive Fuzhou fish balls, quail eggs, and perfectly chewy ramen noodles. The quality of every item was impressive, especially the beef, which was outstanding considering the price. The lamb was a tad tough, but still enjoyable.

And the drinks! The Malaysian iced tea was a refreshing complement to our feast. But it was the dessert that was the true star for me — a delightful concoction of small tapioca pearls with sweet potato and taro. It was the perfect sweet note to end on.

Speaking of notes, their pricing is as appetizing as their food, making this spot an all-around win. I'm already planning my next visit and can't recommend this spot enough for any hot pot aficionado out there.",1
10413,"Ordered from Bold Ramen tonight and was quite disappointed. Delivery was over an hour late without any communication about the delay, which was unacceptable as the original estimate was 35-45 minutes.

As for the food, it didn't meet expectations, especially considering the price. The broth had a decent flavor and was thicker than average, but the heat level fell short of the ""Whoa that's hot"" I'd requested, offering only a light tingle of spice.

The pork chasu, a key component in any ramen, was chewy instead of tender, thinly sliced, and overcooked. This wasn't what I was looking forward to. The noodles suffered from being underdone and clumped together into an unappetizing brick, likely a result of sitting idle at the restaurant for too long.

Toppings were a letdown as well, with the soft-boiled egg being underdone to the point where the whites were runny, and the only other addition being green onions. It felt sparse and underwhelming for what I paid.

In summary, the meal was just fine, but given the issues with delivery, food quality, and the cost-to-value ratio, I wouldn't order from Bold Ramen again.",1
20278,"Although the ambience and setting of this restaurant is unique and fitting to the cuisine presented, the dishes I ordered were quite disappointing. Initially after viewing the menu, I was excited to get a Singaporean dish that complemented my vegetarian diet. I ordered the Chili and Golden Garlic Fried Rice and it was dry with misplaced spice, and minimal tofu. I actually had to request for the waitress to bring me additional sauces and dressings to make this dessicated dish a little more moist and appealing. My friend ordered the Golden Fried Rice with Mixed Seafood, and was quite disappointed with what he was presented with- also dry and lack of flavor. My experience at Laut Singapura is one I will not repeat, but I do recommend trying something besides a fried rice if you do end up finding yourself here!",0
15260,"I have been hearing about this place for so long from my friends and finally got the chance to try it out for myself. New York City is full of great delicious vegan/vegetarian restaurants but not all of them are phenomenally good. This place is good for one time but I won't make it my regular spot. Me and my friend ordered, Tomato Basil Soup, Mac N' Cheese, Air Baked Fries, and The Classic Burger. Overall the food was mediocre. I was so excited to try their Mac N' Cheese but eh it was awful, I would give it a 2 out of 10 (1 is the lowest and 10 is the highest). It is conveniently located by the train station. They have free WiFi and gender neutral bathroom. Cleanliness is 8 out of 10. I thought the young host taking our order was very friendly, attentive and attempted to help us out in deciding what to order. They do charge extra for any substitutions which I really don't like. At the register you must order your food and wait for your name to be called. They also send you a text message when your food is ready for pickup.",0
13644,"Title: A Taco Lover's Dream Come True

I'm head over heels for the tacos at this gem of a spot! The tortillas are made fresh, and there's a choice between corn or flour, both perfect canvases for the mouthwatering grilled meats that are seasoned to perfection. The menu keeps it simple yet exquisite with four main offerings: carne asada, pollo, adobada, and an intriguing nopale option for the adventurous eaters.

Each taco is adorned with a generous topping of onions, salsa, cilantro, and what seems like homemade guacamole, creating a symphony of flavors that dance on the palate. The meats boast a deep, smoky grilled essence that's simply addictive. And for those who enjoy a fiery kick, an assortment of hot sauces and pico de gallo is available to dial up the heat.

Be warned, this is not a sit-down dining experience. It's standing-room-only, but this no-frills approach lets the food shine without any distractions. Ideal for a quick, satisfying bite, I found myself savoring each taco and already planning my next visit. Easily, I could down 4-5 of these culinary delights in one go. I wholeheartedly recommend this place to fellow taco enthusiasts!

Rating: 5/5 - Must-try for a quick taco fix!",1
2384,"Title: A Slice of Heaven at My Favorite Spot

I can't help but rave about this gem of a restaurant that consistently captures my heart with its delightful staff and exquisitely tasty dishes. My go-to order, the pizza, is an absolute marvel; every bite sends waves of joy across my taste buds, coaxing a smile with each mouthful. Admittedly, the tables are on the smaller side, so it's best to visit pre-shopping spree, but they serve their purpose. I recently shared this culinary delight with friends from the UK and Florida, keen to have them taste what I boldly claim to be the BEST pizza they'll ever have. The verdict? Mmmmm. Yummy stuff. And to top it off, even the crust is divine, as evidenced by the photo I snapped just before satisfying my cravings. Truly, this place remains a beloved favorite.",1
15687,"Title: A Culinary Gem That Lives Up to the Hype

Review:

Don't let the modest presentation fool you—this place is a treasure trove of flavors that truly lives up to its buzzing reputation. Having been here numerous times, the consistency of quality and the wallet-friendly prices never fail to impress. For just $6.50, the pork & chicken rice is my go-to choice, offering a satisfying blend of their scrumptious cha siu and what I consider to be an underrated chicken. Meanwhile, my boyfriend swears by the pork & duck combo, equal in price but just as rich in flavor.

Yes, it's true, you may end up devouring an entire box by yourself, but the food is so compelling, self-control becomes an afterthought. And while the attached photos might not do justice to the dishes, trust your senses—the aroma and taste are nothing short of amazing. Just do it, and let your taste buds thank you later.",1
15144,"You can easily miss this restaurant if you aren't looking for it. We wanted to try this place so we were looking for the sign. It's shared space with a coffee joint. Super cute interior. Very hip yet rustic. Hostess was friendly and let us pick our seat. Not too many servers so service isn't too fast which is fine. Ordered a few things to share. Scallion pancake with bacon $7 - this was pretty good. I like that it wasn't too oily, crunchy and the flavor of the bacon really enhanced the pancake. I am used to this as just a scallion pancake but the bacon makes it quite delicious. Definitely try this. The dipping sauce is good and light.Grandma's soup dumplings $6.50 - It is pretty expensive for size and amount (only four dumplings) compared to Chinatown offerings but it's not bad for the neighborhood, I guess. There is a lot of meat in this and the soup was good. The meat wasn't as soft as I've had at other locations but there was plenty of it.Grandma's braised pork lunch special $12 - not bad. The pork had good flavor and I really enjoyed the sauce with the rice. The rice was a little hard so the sauce made it more enjoyable. Pork was a bit chewy too. Wasn't sure if it was supposed to be like that. Accompanying vegetables were standard. Complimentary fried wonton wrapper - this was really good. I totally enjoyed this. It's crispy, crunchy and tasty. Goes well with the meal and a great snack before your dishes arrive. Do note that the glasses for water are all different sizes at each table. Threw us off but perhaps this is the unique vibe they are going for. Food isn't bad, price can be a bit shocking but dining here once in a while won't be too shabby.",0
20175,"Title: A Seafood Haven at Mission Ceviche in Gansevoort Market

Mission Ceviche is a gem within Chelsea's bustling Gansevoort Market, shining bright with its extraordinary offerings. Upon my visit, I opted for the seafood mixto—a wise decision, as the dish was promptly served in under five minutes, catering to time-constrained lunch-goers with ease.

The bowl brimmed with generous portions of succulent shrimp, tender pulpo, and impeccably fresh fish, all drizzled with the sublime aji Amarillo sauce, imparting a delightful spiciness to the meal. The butter lettuce underneath was, quite possibly, the freshest I've ever enjoyed, enhancing the overall lightness of the ceviche.

The Peruvian corn scattered throughout added a satisfying crunch that paired wonderfully with the seafood. A creative twist came in the form of sweet potato and avocado mousses—unconventional but a tasty reinterpretation of classic ceviche accompaniments.

In a city teeming with culinary marvels, Mission Ceviche stands out, promising a return visit for another taste of their exceptional mixed bowl.",1
20844,"I recently stopped by a pizza joint that might win the award for the most generic name ever. In keeping with the theme, I decided to grab their dollar slice, which turned out to be the epitome of 'generic pizza.' For those looking for bells and whistles, they do offer a variety of toppings, but I was all about that quick and cheap fix.

The place itself is unprepossessing, barely more than a hole in the wall, with a small counter where you can find your standard pizza accouterments like oregano and chili flakes. My slice could have benefited from a bit more time in the oven but was passable for something so economical. If you're in a hurry and your wallet's light, it'll do in a pinch.",1
20183,"With a three piece jazz band in the corner and lively atmosphere, you won't necessarily expect a classic seven course prix fixe but you should get it. While you can get the menu a la carte, the prix fixe is the best way to try many of the delicious pasta and seafood on the menu. Service is excellent and on par with any other Michelin Star restaurant. They also have great cocktails as well as a couple of non alcoholic cocktails- a trend I'm very happy about. At the end of the meal they give you a little loaf from the sister bakery to take home - another trend I'm happy about.",0
1277,"Restaurant week NYC is overwhelming. So many restaurants to try not enough time to explore them all. I wanted something special to celebrate my daughter's birthday and Bobby Van's did not disappoint! The restaurant is breath taking inside. It is like walking back in time to an era when hospitality was an art form. The men stood the entire time I was there. They were respectful and friendly. The bar was massive old wood bar which was abdolutely gorgeous. The food was delicous. We began we ith a bread assortment that had a sesame roll, pumpernickel roll, focacia, and crackers. So fresh we ate them all. Next I tried the beet and barley with mandarin orange salad. That dressing was delicous!! The cesar salad was also very good and the portions generous. Our feast continued with Ny Strip, vegetables, and fries (my daughter is not a fan of garlic mashed potatoes). All came out hot and delectable. My entree was cod with an outstanding breading but the citrus sauce is what knocked it out of the park. Fish cooked perfectly, the best arugula I have ever enjoyed. I was so happy and full that I couldn't have dessert. The waiter was friendly but not over bearing. It was the best lunch ever.",0

3443,"When hunger calls and it's late cafeteria is the go to spot.There was no wait tonight which was a blessing because it is too cold to wait online for a table. I decided to order something new tonight opposed to my normal order, I ordered the Bacon Gouda mac and cheese for my starter which was much better then i remember. Perfectly made, not overly cheesy and the noodles tasted seasoned as well, I love bacon like I believe bacon makes everything better  so the fact the chef was extra generous with the bacon this evening was delightful. For my entree i ordered the braised short rib (still on the bone)which came highly recommended by my waitress Kasey whom was an amazing server and super pleasant. My short rib came out quite fast before I could finish my Mac and cheese. It was paired with garlic mashed potatoes and a gravy. The short rib was very tasty and well cooked, extremely tender. The fat to meat ratio wasn't to my liking but the taste made up for it. The gravy/sauce complimented the taste of the short rib very well. I finished it all. My service was great, I love when the entire wait staff works together. When my water glass was empty another server noticed and came and refilled it without hesitation. Kasey was my server as I mentioned above and when dining out no matter how good the food is if not coupled with a capable and attentive server it's counter productive.",0
13908,"I recently dined at this local restaurant and was quite pleased with the experience. The food served was both good and fresh, with the standout being a particularly delicious hummus accompanied by a generously sized piece of pita. The staff were not only friendly but also helpful in providing information about the menu items. I appreciated the cleanliness of the dining area, although the state of the bathroom left something to be desired. Overall, a recommended spot for a tasty meal with amicable service.",1
21046,"Title: Great Flavors but Marred by Food Poisoning

I recently visited this restaurant with a friend on a Wednesday evening and was pleased to find that we were quickly seated within 10 minutes. The layout features a cozy bar area at the front and a more expansive seating section towards the back.

The culinary highlight of our visit was the shoyu ramen, which boasted succulent, melt-in-your-mouth pork and perfectly chewy noodles. The spicy vegetable ramen also impressed with its robust heat - not for the faint of heart, but excellent for spice enthusiasts.

Unfortunately, despite the exceptional flavors and enjoyable ambiance, I must caution potential diners as my experience was severely dampened by a bout of food poisoning attributed to my shoyu ramen meal. While my friend, who had the spicy vegetable ramen, was unaffected, my own health mishap leaves me no choice but to rate this establishment with 2 stars. It's a real shame because the food and the space truly were remarkable. I'd be willing to give this place another try in the future, hoping my experience was a rare oversight rather than a common occurrence.",1
19724,"Title: A First Taste of Georgian Delights

I recently ventured into the realm of Georgian cuisine and opted for their star dishes - Adrajuli and Khinkali. The Lamb Khinkali, akin to a hearty dumpling, pleasantly surprised me with its brothy interior. A dash of pepper elevated its savory taste, offering a distinct experience from the familiar Asian xiao long bao, yet still packed with its own unique flavors.

The Adrajuli, a novel creation featuring a bread bowl brimming with cheese, topped with a raw egg and a knob of butter, promised a culinary adventure. The ritual of mixing and dipping the bread into the molten cheese held a certain charm, though the end result leaned toward the plain side for my palate, teetering between blandness and overt saltiness.

Between the two, Khinkali won my favor. While Adrajuli didn't quite hit the mark for me, it's an intriguing dish that others might appreciate. Georgian cuisine is worth exploring, and I look forward to discovering other flavors it has to offer.",1
20341,"Title: Hits and Misses at Burger and Lobster

I visited Burger and Lobster with high expectations for a celebratory birthday lunch, enticed by the promise of their famed duo. The lobster roll lived up to its reputation – an exceptional dish whose bread alone would be a delight to savor. It set a high bar, which unfortunately the rest of the meal couldn’t meet.

The calamari fell flat, overcooked to the point of leaving much to be desired, and the truffle fries simply weren't worth the extra charge. On the flip side, the 1.5 lb lobster didn’t disappoint in size or quality, proving to be a succulent, shareable delight, though the garlic parmesan butter felt unnecessary.

Service dampened the experience further; neglect seemed to be the theme, with our server’s attention nearly impossible to capture in the sparsely populated dining room.

Though the lobster roll could tempt me back on its own, given the overall experience, my return isn't on the horizon anytime soon.",1
3028,"Title: A True Sushi Enthusiast's Delight at Zauo

My recent dining experience at Zauo was nothing short of delightful, particularly for a sushi aficionado like myself. When my boss suggested a visit, my response was an immediate yes, and the restaurant didn't disappoint.

While the service was decent yet unremarkable, the freshness of their farm-raised fish was a standout feature, even though its robust, gamey flavor might not cater to all palates—especially those accustomed to the mild taste of California Rolls. 

For those less inclined towards raw fish, Zauo offers a variety of cooked alternatives. A personal highlight was the salmon presented on a quaint wooden boat, accompanied by a Shabu setup, allowing the pleasure of cooking the salmon to one's liking.

In conclusion, Zauo delivers a fun, engaging dining experience that encourages guests to venture beyond their culinary comfort zones. It's a must-visit for anyone with a genuine passion for sushi in its most authentic form.",1
12004,"We came for focaccia Friday last week, and it was excellent. We got there at 6pm, and the first wave was already sold out, so we stuck around until 7:15 for the second wave to come out. There were three options, and we got one of each (in order of preference): squash, tomato, and cauliflower. The squash was the standout, but all three were great, and the bread itself was great too. If they started a restaurant just for their focaccia, I'm pretty sure I would be a repeat customer, although I do like Bread & Salt more, and PQR at least as much.On their other food -- I'm still not really getting it. This time, we got the new creation, and two specials -- chicories salad, and a cranberry bean dip. All three of these were fine, but not nearly among my favorite vegetable dishes in the city. That's obviously a high standard, but people absolutely rave about this place, and I just haven't quite understood that hype.",0
21054,"Nice dinner at Hillstone. The inside is really cozy, dark and has a cool atmosphere. The open kitchen and the piano bar make it even more personal and homy.

The food was decent but not worth the price point. Menu lacked options and especially side dishes. Portions are extremely small. I went to this restaurant with my fiancé and ordered sautéed kimchi $8, assorted meat plate $58 and assorted vegetables $8. Meat was cut smaller than other Korean/ Japanese BBQ restaurants in the area. I could've definitely ordered another meat plate for the portions we were served.

I returned to sample the Unagi Don Set and Tuna Tataki, and I was blown away by both dishes. The Unagi Don featured a massive, perfectly marinated fillet of eel, striking an excellent balance between sweet and savory, and boasting a fresh, juicy taste. It rested on a bed of flavorful nori that added an umami punch to the dish. The Tuna Tataki packed a lovely heat, paired with a sublime cream sauce that truly enhanced the seared fish’s flavor. The texture was spot-on, with a sashimi-like center that met my expectations. Both dishes come highly recommended for their exceptional quality and taste.",1
220,"Really good food! When we first got our orders, we thought it wouldn't be filling because it was served in small bowls, but we were wrong.

I've had better eggplant elsewhere, but it's not bad here.Coming back for sure!",0
14073,"Title: A Birthday Pre-Game to Remember at a Rooftop Gem

I recently celebrated my birthday at this delightful restaurant, and it was an unforgettable experience. The atmosphere upon arrival was immediately captivating – vibrant yet cozy, setting the stage for a memorable evening. The highlight, without a doubt, was the stunning rooftop view. It’s the quintessential NYC backdrop that elevates any dining experience.

But let’s talk about the vibe - it lives and breathes through the music here, which was absolutely on point! It’s often said that good tunes are the heartbeat of a great night out, and they’ve nailed it, ensuring the energy never dipped.

On to the culinary offerings, the appetizers were a delicious prelude to the night. We indulged in wings, tuna tartare, calamari, a classic margarita pizza, and fries. The tuna tartare was the standout for me, fresh and flavorful, while the fries were a surprising hit, crispy and perfectly seasoned. My cousin gave the wings two thumbs up – they’re a must-try according to him.

I wholeheartedly recommend this spot, especially on a Friday night when it's absolutely ""popping"". It's a fabulous choice for anyone looking to kick off their birthday festivities with a bang.",1
14089,"Hands down the best steak I've ever had. And my husband and I have done our own ""steak tours"" in a few different states. We ordered the king cut prime rib & the meat literally melted in our mouth. It was perfectly seasoned and cooked. We were given a horseradish sauce that they said comes with the king cut, but to be honest we didn't even use it. It wasn't needed. We shared the prime rib due to its IMMENSE size; I really don't know how one person finishes a whole prime rib by themselves but I know they do it.... my husband did it when he came to NYC a few years ago. We ordered the creamed spinach and mashed Yukon gold for our sides. We love creamed spinach in general, but the mashed Yukon gold was incredible and stood out to us!!! For an appetizer we ordered the crab cake and it was great! Very soft and flavorful. We both ordered drinks: I forgot the name of the cocktail I ordered but my husband ordered an old fashioned and he loved it. One recommendation: don't get the Cabernet if you're getting the prime rib. It was recommended to us but it made the meat taste unbearably salty.",0

17752,"Tucked away by the West Side Highway on 16th Street, Del Posto presents an atmosphere reminiscent of a private club, blending sophistication with a relaxed charm. This sizable, dimly lit restaurant spans two floors, connected by a notably steep staircase that, after a few glasses of wine, demands a cautious descent.

Diners at Del Posto are faced with two delectable decisions: a $149 four-course prix fixe menu offering a personalized culinary journey from appetizer, shared pastas, main course to dessert, or the indulgence of an eight-course chef's tasting menu, priced at $179 with a vegan option, surrendering their tastes to the kitchen's curated experience. Those in search of a lunchtime bargain can relish in the same quality at $49 for a three-course meal, with a worthwhile $10 supplement for an additional pasta dish.

Del Posto's culinary forte is high-end Italian fare, distinguished by its lack of contemporary gimmicks like foams or molecular gastronomy. Instead, it's the destination for superb pasta and impeccably cooked proteins, such as fish or veal, all served with the attentiveness expected from a premier European establishment.

Ultimately, Del Posto stands out as a gem in New York's vast dining landscape, particularly for connoisseurs of Italian cuisine and those who appreciate a touch of luxury. Expect to depart with a sense of satisfaction reserved for meals that are not just eaten, but experienced.",1
1093,"I had an underwhelming experience at this café, particularly with their glazed chocolate donuts which were dry and lacked any real flavor—a disappointing indulgence not worth the caloric splurge. Additionally, the milk alternatives were scant, limited to soy, skim, and cream, which may not meet everyone's preferences. As for the coffee, it was a letdown and had me regretting not opting for a familiar cup from the nearby Starbucks. Overall, my visit was unsatisfactory and I would be hesitant to return or recommend it to others.",1
14951,"Title: Nostalgic Diner with Hearty and Healthy Options - 3.5 Stars

Walking into Andrew's Diner, you're immediately greeted by the charm of an antiquated, bustling space that cleverly houses a pizza oven that catches the eye. The diner offers a variety that seems standard, with the exception of pizza, which is not a typical diner staple.

Upon arrival, my friend and I were taken back to our school days, lining up before being seated in a nearly full house. Post a carb-heavy evening, my priority was a light and healthy lunch - a tall order in a place potentially teetering on the edge of ""greasy spoon"" territory.

After scanning the menu, the chicken fajita salad at the bottom of the salad section called out to me - and my companion as well. Despite the brisk service that bordered on the curt side, the salads delivered were unexpectedly generous. Priced at $12.75, the salad was a satisfying ensemble of well-seasoned grilled chicken, crisp veggies, and fat-free raspberry vinaigrette on the side, fulfilling my conscientious dining criteria for the day.

Though the salad was the star of this visit, the surrounding pizza and all-day breakfast fare served to others looked tantalizing enough to warrant a return. Maybe next time, I'll dive into their pizza.

Andrew's Diner might be a throwback, but it's one I'd recommend for those seeking both flavorful comfort and lighter dishes.",1
3193,"Title: Birthday Bliss at Pat'r Palo

For the second year running, Pat'r Palo hosted my birthday celebration and did not disappoint. The bottomless brunch is a treasure trove of delectable items offered at a steal, with prices that are considerate of both adult and junior appetites. The star of the starters was undoubtedly the ceviche – the finest rendition I’ve savored at a dining establishment. The Churrasco entrée was even more mouthwatering than I remembered, somehow surpassing the previous year's experience.

Officially, brunch spans an hour and a half, but thanks to the exceptional service from our waiter, Benjamin, we luxuriated in a leisurely two and a half hours of dining pleasure. The festive spirit was amplified with complimentary tequila shots, a generous gesture that I had to gracefully decline after the third – a testament to their dedication to ensure everyone has a fantastic time.

Pat'r Palo exudes charm and boasts service that transcends excellence. If it were possible, I'd indulge in their Sunday brunch tradition weekly. Simply put, Pat'r Palo is the pinnacle of brunch spots – unbeatable and unforgettable.",1
15844,"Title: Affordable Delight at Kunjip

If you're in Manhattan's KTown and your wallet isn't feeling too heavy, head to Kunjip for their lunch specials - a midday feast without the hefty price tag. The spicy beef stew, a personal favorite, is a standout offering for under $10. And unlike at the Food Gallery, the price isn't the only appeal. 

Kunjip doesn't skimp on the extras; the meal includes an array of side dishes that complete the experience. A highlight for me is their purple multigrain rice - a healthier and tastier alternative to the traditional white, which I greatly appreciate. 

Do keep in mind, dinner time here is a different story. With its popularity come long lines, so plan accordingly. For a quieter, wallet-friendly meal, lunch at Kunjip is hard to beat.",1
10910,"Title: Cozy Midday Dining at Midtown's French Haven

My friend and I were wandering through midtown west on MLK day when the craving for French Onion Soup led us to a snug little bistro around 2:00 pm. The place was quiet, suggesting we had just missed the lunch rush—a blessing for those who enjoy a peaceful meal.

We chose to sit at the bar and were greeted by a friendly bartender who ensured a relaxed dining experience without any rush. Our appetite called for a somewhat hearty selection; we opted for the French Onion Soup, Steak Tartare, Steak Sandwich, and Gravlox Benedict.

The French Onion Soup and Steak Tartare were the stars of our meal, both satisfying the craving and setting a high bar with their flavors. The Steak Sandwich, albeit tasty with its perfectly cooked medium-rare center, proved to be a bit of a challenge with some stubborn pieces of meat resisting an easy bite. The Gravlox Benedict, featuring a potato blini, was a creative take but fell short in both satiety and personal preference.

All things considered, the visit was a pleasure with commendable dishes and attentive service at a time when tranquility was an unexpected guest.",1

I order the same burger with bacon and cheese that I really do love. The burger is extremely juicy which isn't easy to do when I'm ordering a well done burger. The bacon has always come out crispy, it really is a good well balanced burger. I had to take a star off for how hard it was to get he ""waitresses"" attention throughout my meal. She stayed behind the bar most of the time so I'm assuming she is actually a bartender which I have no problem about but I noticed she stays behind the bar most of the time not just with me but with anyone who doesn't sit at the bar.",0

Opting for simplicity yet a classic, I indulged in the ham and cheese baguette, which was a mouthwatering reminder of its Parisian counterparts. My husband's choice of the Salmon sandwich was equally impressive, showcasing the quality of ingredients the kitchen upholds.

We couldn't resist the array of delicate macarons, each a tiny bite of heaven. However, the star of the show was the ""ohoh,"" a remarkable rendition of a Swiss cake roll that dazzled with its freshness and flavors - an absolute must-try.

To complement our meal, I enjoyed a flawlessly crafted iced cappuccino with almond milk, proving their coffee game to be as strong as their culinary offerings. This bistro is more than just a meal; it's a little slice of Paris served with excellence. A wholehearted recommendation for anyone looking to savor the French joie de vivre!",1
20618,"I recently stopped by this little gem of a shop and was pleasantly surprised by their offerings. The $2 stuffing cake was quite a treat – flavorful and satisfying. I also tried the spicy chicken and smoked fish kimbap, both of which were delicious and well-prepared. The variety of Japanese snacks caught my eye, and I couldn't resist grabbing a can of potato chips, which proved to be a delightful snack. The shop itself is on the smaller side and closes at 5 pm, so plan accordingly. Fortunately, even on a lovely Saturday early afternoon, the line was quite manageable. Definitely worth a visit for a quick and tasty bite!",1

1137,"I recently dined at a restaurant where the food was nothing to write home about, and the service fell significantly short of expectations. Visiting on a Monday evening, the establishment wasn't particularly busy, yet it seemed they were understaffed, with only one server handling the entire back area.

Despite the manageable crowd, getting our server's attention required concerted effort; she did not check on us once our food arrived, and our request for drinks was met with an excuse about a lost ticket, leading to a cancellation. Requests for condiments were also met with delay, arriving too late to be of use.

Additionally, a pre-set tipping system using the Square app seemed to remove any motivation for delivering quality service, and we reluctantly left an 18% tip—the minimum allowed—simply to expedite our departure. Overall, the experience did not justify the $70 spent, and I am left with no desire to return.",1
3083,"Came here on a Sunday for brunch. I FINALLY got a chance to come here as it's been very difficult to make reservation. But this time, we somehow managed to make the reservation on Monday for this Sunday brunch. My friends and I got garganelli ($20), tagliatelle ($23), and tajarin carbonara ($23). All of them were SO DELICIOUS and al dente. I especially loved the gargaelli as the mushroom rage was extremely flavorful which I did not expect at all. Ricotta salata on top went very well with the pasta sauce as well. Tagliatelle and carbonara are both typical pasta but they were also super good. The portion size was good enough to make me feel content but it can definitely be not filling if I came here hungry. It's a good price for such delicious and quality pasta though. Next time, I do wanna try their roasted mushrooms appetizer as I've heard so many good things about it. The restaurant is also super pretty and has nice atmosphere, which makes it a perfect spot for a date night or occasion. Can't wait to come back here again!",0

Only a couple of courses in, my dad asked why Atomix had only one Michelin star. When informed they've only been open for a year, he said they would get their second star next go-around, and of course they did.In short: when money is no object and for a special occasion, absolutely the move.

It's a hushed, borderline stuffy atmosphere, but I personally think a meal like this benefits from the sense of ceremony.That's not to say that this precise tasting menu is without heart-- the hospitality, though carefully choreographed, adds the perfect touch of warmth. The way you start and end your meal evidence the thought they've put into the experience: you choose your pair of chopsticks from a beautiful collection at the beginning, and at the end you're given a nicely wrapped gift of abstract postcards detailing the menu. Next level.No words for the food. Let me just say that tastes as good as it looks.If you're waffling on committing to what is quite a pricey meal, give Atoboy (or the bar here) a try first.

I enjoyed the Bryant Park Punch, and the burger I ordered was surprisingly delicious. However, my husband's experience was less impressive. Although his burger with lobster was satisfactory, his lobster Mac and cheese was disappointingly bland; it seemed to lack any discernible flavor. As someone with a seafood allergy, I couldn’t taste it for myself, but it's concerning that such a dish would be served. Despite this hiccup, the service was commendable. The staff was attentive and efficient, even in the midst of a busy period. While I would recommend the restaurant based on our overall experience and the quality of service, it would be best to steer clear of the lobster Mac and cheese.",1
16125,"Finally made it to this long-awaited spot, and it's a charmingly small place with a homely vibe and attentive service. The Greek salad is a must-try starter, boasting beautifully fresh, thick-cut cucumbers, and tomatoes, alongside ample feta, olives, and red onions—all without a leaf of lettuce in sight. It was thoroughly enjoyable with just the right splash of red wine vinegar.

The star of the show, however, is their Chicago deep dish pizza. If you're not here for that, you're missing the point. It's a hearty fork-and-knife affair with a lavish layer of chunky tomato sauce and an abundance of stringy mozzarella. While the overall flavor was satisfying, the sauce could have used a bit more seasoning to truly shine, and the crust, although substantial, was a tad on the dry and grainy side—a surprise given the expectations of a buttery indulgence. The high-quality sausage, served in crumbly balls, was delectable although sparsely scattered across the pizza.

While the pizza provides a novel experience for those unaccustomed to cutlery-required pies, the slight letdown from the buildup means I'm not rushing back. Quick note: the thin crust also looked inviting, and keep in mind they open at 5:30 PM on Monday and Tuesday, with reservations often needed.",1

Our group of 15 landed there on a bustling Saturday night, mainly due to their capacity to accommodate us on short notice. A nod is due for the complimentary drinks provided, nudging my rating to a 3. However, the cuisine failed to justify the steep average price tag of $25, presenting us with undercooked and tepid noodles. A consolation was the gratis bread and water, surprisingly listed as $2 on the menu. My advice for fellow diners: it's worth scouting out other options in the neighborhood.",1
11938,"Title: A Spicy Thai Delight at Up Thai in NYC

As a connoisseur of heat-infused dishes, I often gravitate towards Thai cuisine to satiate my fiery palate. On a recent evening in New York City, my craving for Thai was insatiable, prompting me to scour UberEats for a remedy. Up Thai emerged as the beacon of spice I was searching for, and I eagerly placed an order for their Nam Tok.

My anticipation was met with a swift delivery, the meal arriving in just half an hour. The dish was a generous serving of beef that struck a perfect balance between savory and searing, nestled atop a fresh bed of vegetables. Adding to the medley of flavors, the rice arrived delicately wrapped in leaves, providing a subtle sweetness that complemented the spice admirably.

In summary, my dining experience with Up Thai was nothing short of satisfying. The meal quenched my desire for a spicy Thai adventure and left a lingering promise of return in my taste buds. Up Thai has certainly earned a future revisit for my spicy cravings.",1

Our New York adventure began with a delightful discovery—a quaint restaurant named Raku. Despite arriving encumbered with two large carriers, the staff at Raku were warm and accommodating, storing our bulky luggage in the back so we could enjoy our meal unencumbered.

We perched at the bar tables and commenced with the Chicken Tatsuta-age. Served piping hot, it was a hit-and-miss for us; I found it too oily for my taste, though my sister relished each juicy bite. The main event was their udon—oh, the udon! Skepticism was shed as I savored the best noodles on the East Coast, possibly outstripping all prior udon experiences. The texture and flavor were impeccable, proof that Raku’s reputation is well-earned.

In short, Raku's exceptional udon alone is worth the visit. Highly recommended for noodle enthusiasts and anyone looking for an authentic taste of Japan in the heart of the city.",1

2740,"Title: A Gastronomic Delight That Truly Satisfies

My recent dining experience was nothing short of extraordinary, worthy of a rating that breaks the conventional scale: the food was a 12 out of 10. The standout dishes that left me immensely satisfied included the supremely fresh burrata salad, the divine kale panzanella, and a lemon pasta that was the epitome of al dente perfection.

Although dining al fresco was slightly marred by the unavoidable presence of a screaming baby, our spirits were lifted by the intriguing spectacle of a man across the street, which oddly added to the unique ambiance. In fact, it was so compelling that it's inspired thoughts of a charitable collection for his comfort in the heat.

Chef Nacho's culinary prowess is unequivocal – his mastery of flavors and textures had even the smallest guest, not usually inclined towards sweets, devouring dessert with an enthusiasm that nearly extended to the tablecloth itself.

A waiter/waitress comes to take your order at the table. I got the falafel wrap, which was tasty and very fresh, but I don't think I would come here again personally solely because I don't want to pay over 10$ for a falafel that comes in a tortilla wheat wrap.

20765,"I recently visited a pizza joint situated in a prime location on 23rd street, right by the subway, which proved to be incredibly convenient. The place boasted an extensive menu, especially at lunchtime, offering an intriguing variety of options. As a first-timer to Detroit style pizza, I decided to try the black olive slices. 

To my surprise, what I thought would be 2 slices turned out to be 8 generous square pieces, as each 'slice' is actually a hefty quarter of a large square pizza. Adding to the uniqueness, the sauce was layered on top of the cheese, diverging from the traditional pizza-making method.

However, despite the ample portion size, the experience was overshadowed by an unpleasant odor that emanated from the pizza as I transported it back to my office. The aroma was far from the mouthwatering scent one would expect, which was disappointing. After indulging in the 8 substantial slices with a total of $24 spent, I was left unimpressed by the overall experience.",1

Unfortunately, the dduk boki fell short of expectations; its sauce was disappointingly syrupy and lacked depth of flavor. However, the kimchi jjigae was a pleasant surprise. Packed with pork, rice cakes, noodles, and vegetables, it brought a comforting and authentic taste that saved the meal. Should I return, my sights will be set solely on the kimchi jjigae.",1

I never had dakgalbi before but I wanted to try it. A coworker and I decided to grab lunch here the day before Thanksgiving, thinking it wouldn't be too crowded at 2PM. We were wrong, there was a lot of people here. We waited about 10 minutes and then were seated.The menu pricing is per serving, so with two people it'll be $19.95 x 2. We went with two orders of the Cheese Dakgalbi, medium spice and added instant noodles and gimmari (fried seaweed with noodles) for our dish.Okay, it is a very picturesque dish when it comes out. It looks big but the portion size actually is pretty normal. While I would have liked a larger portion size for a $40 dish, it is quite filling especially with the cheese. I enjoyed this, it was spicy, it was different and it led me to keep craving more as I ate.I'm a sucker for instant noodles so I loved the ramen in it. We added the the cheese fried rice at the end, I would probably save a bit more chicken next time. I'd liked to have added that to the rice too.Only went for lunch but with the crowd at 2PM, I'd imagine prime time on a weekend night must be an animal house. Although friends have said this location is not that great compared to the one in Korea, I feel like you could say that about anything imported here from Asia. Of course it tastes better over there.I think the fact that New York now has a new offering for Korean cuisine is great. A year ago, I didn't even knbow what dakgalbi is. That's a win in my eyes.",0

Tough act to follow for sure but The Craftsman could definitely try harder.  The decor is nice but I didn't find anything that would keep me particularly interested in coming back. This place met my need for a pseudo-new spot to kill time while waiting for a friend. Very little representation of neighborhood locals, especially for Harlem.  Perhaps I went too early?  Bartender wasn't engaging and I felt like I was giving him more hospitality than I received.  I tipped well and moved along after my friend arrived.

223,"Title: A Must-Try Dry Hotpot Haven Near NYU

As an NYU neighbor, I was thrilled with the opening of this new culinary spot, especially given its standout dish: the dry hotpot. While I haven't ventured beyond this menu item, I can't recommend it enough—it's absolutely a must-try.

The process is part of the fun; you select your preferred meats or seafood, pile on the vegetables, and then they weigh your bowl to determine the price—usually landing between $15-$17. This includes a comforting bowl of white rice, which pairs perfectly with the hotpot.

Even as a mild spice enthusiast, I find the lowest spice level to be a delightful mix of gentle heat and subtle sweetness. My top picks for the hotpot include crunch of wood ear, savory sausage, rich fish cake, tender beef, crisp lotus, and earthy mushrooms. These ingredients blend seamlessly, but don't skip on the rice—it's the perfect base to counterbalance the dish's saltiness.

In a nutshell, if you're in the area and hankering for something uniquely flavorful, treat yourself to this spot's dry hotpot. It's a gastronomic experience that you won't soon forget.",1
13724,"Title: A Beef Noodle Soup Revival at 886

After a string of unimpressive culinary experiences in Manhattan, I finally struck gold at 886 with their beef noodle soup. The soup boasted a rich, beefy flavor, evidence of the painstaking process of boiling oxtail bones to craft the perfect broth. The beef was tender, succulent, and well-seasoned, elevating the dish to the top of my citywide list.

Be warned, the portions at 886 are generous. The beef noodle soup could easily feed a small group, so consider sharing if you're eager to explore other menu items.

On a less enthusiastic note, the oyster omelette was overwhelmed by scallions and fried onions, and the abundance of bean sprouts did little to enhance the dish. It had potential, though it's not a must-try.

The Taiwanese sausage fried rice, on the other hand, was a delight. The sausage was superbly smoky, and that flavor infused the rice perfectly, making for a very satisfying side.

The ambience of 886 was slightly marred by harsh purple backlighting, which was a bit of an eyesore.

Despite the omelette misstep and the intense lighting, 886 has earned a repeat visit from me. I'm curious about the rest of the menu but must admit, the allure of that beef noodle soup will be tough to resist.",1

From the moment we stepped into the restaurant, we were greeted by the excellence of both staff and fare. Service was prompt, without a beat missed, setting the tone for a dining experience that would surprise and delight us with every bite.

The dishes, a testament to the art of healthy cooking, were crafted to breathe new life into familiar flavors. The sunchoke chips, thinly shaved and strewn atop our salad, introduced a crunch that played well with the subtle surprise of a perfectly executed dressing awaiting at the bottom.

Our main course, a fish fried to a satisfying crisp, was complemented by a vibrant green herb sauce that was nothing short of divine. To sweeten the palate, we indulged in an apple pudding, the warmth of its spices harmonizing with the coolness of date ice cream and delicately julienned apples.

In a refreshing twist, the non-alcoholic pairing showcased the restaurant's innovative spirit, providing a series of beverages that were anything but sweet, yet remarkably refreshing and incredibly well-matched to our meal.

The brunch, a cornucopia of innovation, left no desire unmet. The pancakes were delectable, the duck hash a savory marvel, and the crispy oyster omelette a standout dish. The waffles—ingeniously stuffed with ham and cheese and adorned with a cheese sauce dotted with red peppers—were a cheesy, piquant dream capped off with poached eggs.

Even the sides, like the apple fritters and crispy taters, were executed with flair, proving that no detail is too small to be considered.

In essence, this restaurant is a gem we've been lucky enough to unearth. It's not a question of if we will return, but when.",1
14919,"Securing a reservation at this bustling spot was a feat in itself, but persistence paid off with a primetime slot on Saturday evening. The pre-dinner wait at the bar downstairs presented a slight sting with the $14 vodka tonics that failed to impress, indicating a somewhat overpriced drinks menu.

Once seated, the order of ""single"" burgers with egg and bacon alongside wings led to a moment of sticker shock. The wings, having soared from $18 to $24 within a mere month, and the $25 burgers required a deep dive into the wallet. The meal rang up to $75, a steep sum for the offerings on the table.

Despite the price hike, the wings flew high with their undeniable flavor—truly ""magical,"" as one might say. The burgers, while good, didn't match the taste expectations set by their price tag; they were veiled by an overzealous saltiness that undercut the experience.

In the end, the establishment maintained its reputation with excellent service and those unforgettable wings, earning a solid 4-star rating. Yet, the echo of overpricing leaves a lingering question of value, with hopes that this will be reconsidered in the future.",1

Last night, my dining experience was nothing short of delicious. Opting for the chef's tasting menu was a brilliant decision - every dish was a hit, with the added delight of numerous small snacks to tide us over between courses. The absence of a wine pairing menu was hardly felt, thanks to an inventive cocktail selection that paired beautifully with the meal.

The ambiance of the restaurant struck a perfect balance between intimacy and comfort, with the secondary dining area maintaining the same cozy atmosphere. A highlight for any food lover is the restaurant's beautiful kitchen, visible through large windows, inviting diners to watch the culinary magic unfold.

Price, often a concern with tasting menus, was notably reasonable for the quality and range of food presented.

1508,"Title: Mixed Impressions at Chef's Club with Chef Paul Liebrandt

While I am an admirer of Chef's Club and their innovative guest chef concept, my latest visit with Chef Paul Liebrandt at the helm left me with mixed feelings. Opting for the a la carte menu, our selections included the black truffle Oreo, peeketoe crab doughnut, smoked ravioli, duck for two, and a chocolate soufflé to wrap up the meal.

Regrettably, the truffle Oreo was a disappointment; its fragile construction crumbled at the slightest touch, and the overwhelming coffee cream masked any hint of truffle. The crab doughnut, reminiscent of a mini lobster roll, was pleasing to the palate despite being a touch too greasy. A visual treat, the smoked ravioli fell short in execution; the undercooked pasta with seemingly unseasoned potato consommé was a letdown.

In stark contrast, the duck for two was the star of the evening—succulent and well-seasoned, although a crisper skin and a more thoughtfully dressed bed of greens would have propelled this dish to perfection. The chocolate soufflé was a standard, competent finish but didn't stray from the familiar.

Service throughout the evening was congenial yet showed signs of a learning curve. Observing the open kitchen process hinted at operational inefficiencies—prehpped ingredient kits could streamline the preparation significantly.

Considering the premium dining experience that Chef's Club purports to offer, the inconsistencies and missteps experienced were too significant to overlook. Regrettably, the value for the price point just didn't align this time around.",1
14590,"So so good -- came back from my Yelp hiatus to write this even. Came here with my family and was surprised to hear about their M-F $11 lunch special. Honestly, probably one of the best deals you can get in the city! Most pastas (with the exception of the seafood risotto and uni) are $11, even the squid ink and lobster, and everything we tried was just so good and fresh. Between the 4 of us, we split the grilled octopus salad, and had the spinach ravioli, lobster linguini, langoustine fusilli, and lamb cavatelli. The portions were enormous, and everything was so flavorful and cooked perfectly al dente. My personal favorite was the lobster linguini, they were surprisingly generous with the lobster and it tasted really fresh as well. All the pastas had distinctly different flavors (as opposed to everything just tasting the same after awhile) and all were seasoned well. We also loved the grilled octopus salad, I could eat that dressing by the bucketful. I will say that the restaurant itself is a bit crowded and the food did take awhile to arrive (probably a good 20-30 min) so be prepared for a leisurely lunch. Worth it since everything is made to order. 10/10 recommend checking out if in the area!",0
18033,"Title: A Delightful Korean BBQ Experience at My NY Favorite

I recently revisited my go-to spot for Korean BBQ in New York with friends, one of whom was celebrating a birthday. We made a reservation for 9 PM, eagerly anticipating the feast ahead.

For appetizers, we opted for beef sashimi and ddukbbokki. While I passed on the beef sashimi due to personal preference, my friends found the sauce overpoweringly sweet and strong (2/5). The ddukbbokki, although a tad sweeter than usual, still hit the spot and earned a solid (3.5/5).

The main event was a set of prime beef and wine pork belly, partnered with kimchi soup. The prime beef was not as exceptional as it's been during past visits (3.5/5), save for the marinated boneless short rib, which was exceptionally tender and perfectly seasoned. The pork belly, as always, was a triumph (5/5) and outshone the beef, much to my friends' delight.

The kimchi soup was the standout of the night (5/5), acclaimed as the best in the area, so comforting and flavorful that it left us craving more rice to soak up its goodness.

Service at this establishment remains a strong point, with staff who are unfailingly kind and attentive (5/5). Despite a packed house, they managed to serve our birthday cake punctually, adding a special touch to our celebration.

My friends, veterans of the Korean BBQ scene in LA, were highly impressed by both the food and the exceptional service. This place has once again proven to be the perfect choice for authentic Korean delicacies and warm hospitality. Thank you to the entire team for a memorable evening!",1

My college graduation celebration brought me to the bustling ambiance of a revered steakhouse, where the clinking of cutlery set the tone for an evening of culinary indulgence. Despite the restaurant being swarmed with patrons, the service didn't miss a beat; our waiter stood out with his efficiency and impressive knowledge of the menu.

In an act of thoughtful accommodation, he effortlessly split a bowl of clam chowder into sample cups, allowing everyone at the table to savor the appetizer. The food, true to the steakhouse's reputation, was exceptional. The veal tomahawk and the bone-in wagyu were the stars of the evening, cooked to perfection and bursting with succulent flavors that delighted the palate.

While the steak tartare fell short of its counterparts, being my least favorite due to a lack of distinctiveness, it was still a worthy dish for anyone dining alone, ample enough to be a standalone meal. For a steak dinner that won't break the bank yet promises a high-quality experience, this steakhouse proves to be a smart choice for special occasions and gatherings.",1
10834,"As an Australian, I'm partial to all the Australian establishments in New York, and Benson's had been on my list for awhile as one of the best burger places in New York. We finally made it here as a party of two on a Friday night, around 8pm. The place is very casual inside, with bar seating, and most of the interior featuring wooden tables and seating. When we got in, there were only a few people inside, and we were told by an Australian man (we presume the owner) that we could take seats wherever we liked. After a larger group came in, the owner came over and asked us if we could scooch over to another table to accommodate their party. This was fine with us, but the owner then brought my husband another bottle of the beer he was drinking, on the house, which I thought was a nice gesture. Our burgers came out awhile after ordering, perhaps 20 minutes or so. I had the veggie burger with sweet potato chips, while my husband got the classic burger. My veggie burger was made from black beans, and had good texture and condiments, but it paled in comparison to the classic burger. The classic burger was cooked just the right amount to medium rare, with melted cheese sitting atop. The bread was the same for both burgers, and while not bad, better quality burger buns would have made the burgers slightly better. Towards the end of our meal, a large group of rowdy young people came in, and it was hard to hear anything else. Overall, I like the food here and service was great, but it is more of a place to eat and run rather than stick around for the ambience. Would recommend for a decent burger in Lower East Side.",0

My partner and I decided to try this Italian spot known for its dim, romantic setting, ideal for a date night. Upon our first visit, we were seated at the bar, where we found ourselves waiting for about 45 minutes before our order was taken - a little longer than we had hoped.

A mix-up with our meal was gracefully handled by the bartender, who not only fixed the issue but also provided complimentary drinks and a discount on our order, a gesture we greatly appreciated.

As for the food, it was a bit of a mixed bag. The Alfredo with grilled chicken was unfortunately underwhelming, as the chicken seemed boiled rather than grilled, and the sauce didn't quite hit the mark compared to homemade recipes. However, the Mussels Fra Diavolo was a delight, even though it unintentionally ended up as our entrée instead of an appetizer.

Starting off with bread and butter is always a plus in my book, and I was pleased to see that tradition upheld here. While the experience had its ups and downs, the courteous service did mitigate some of the culinary shortcomings.",1

Our waiter comped us a dessert when we couldn't decide between two, which was a nice touch. Definitely recommended!",0
3656,"Title: A Gastronomic Delight at [Restaurant Name]

From the moment I stepped into [Restaurant Name], I was greeted with impeccable service that persisted throughout my dining experience. The manager deserves a special shout-out for running such a seamless operation.

The culinary journey began with Galouti kebabs, which were so exquisitely tender that they simply dissolved in my mouth – an absolute must for any lover of minced lamb. Following this were the Awadh Murg tikka, an innovative combination of black pepper and pomegranate that left the chicken kebabs bursting with flavor – cooked just right!

The Mahi masala followed suit, with the mahi mahi fillets showcasing perfect tenderness amidst a robust, tantalizing sauce. However, the star of the show might have been the Lamb biryani. Rich and fragrant, each bite was a taste of heaven.

No meal ends properly without dessert, and [Restaurant Name] doesn't disappoint. The kulfi was delightfully creamy, and the gulab jamun was sweetly satisfying – both highly recommended for a sweet finish to a delectable meal.

In summary, [Restaurant Name] delivers a superb dining experience that surpasses expectations with faultless food and outstanding service. A true gem!",1
2516,"Title: A Lackluster Culinary Journey at La Esquina

Upon entering La Esquina, the allure of an underground Mexican eatery piqued my interest with its speakeasy vibes. Unfortunately, while the concept and space delivered an exclusive atmosphere, the cuisine did not match the hype.

After navigating through the upstairs taqueria and past the kitchen, the bar area's aesthetic seemed promising. However, the excitement was dampened by an overpriced and standard drink selection. The seating process was chaotic, leaving us waiting at the bar without clear guidance, diminishing the initial charm.

Seated in a cramped corner, we sampled an array of dishes including huarache, queso fundido, elotes, fish tacos, and pulpo tostadas. Although we had hoped for a saving grace in the flavors, the food was merely average and certainly not justification for the steep prices and minuscule portions. 

While La Esquina boasts an intriguing atmosphere, this is overshadowed by its pretense of exclusivity and overall mediocre dining experience. With countless other Mexican options in New York City, La Esquina is a miss for those seeking both exceptional ambiance and tantalizing tastes.",1
18073,"Title: A Hearty Gem on the Upper West Side

Last week, I had the pleasure of dining at a charming spot on the Upper West Side that truly captured the essence of farm-to-table dining. This cozy restaurant made me feel welcome from the moment I stepped in, with an atmosphere that was as inviting as the food was satisfying.

We started with the lentil soup special, which set a high bar for the rest of the meal. I indulged in the salmon with spinach, and was delighted by its perfect preparation. The salmon was cooked to perfection, flaking at the touch of the fork, and the spinach was the quintessence of freshness. My friend's prime rib was equally impressive; a hefty portion that promised a delightful leftover meal for the next day - and it delivered.

The vegetables accompanying our entrees were a standout on their own, showcasing the crisp, garden-fresh flavors one expects from a quality farm-to-table establishment. It was as close to a home-cooked meal as one can get while dining out, with the added luxury of a well-stocked full bar.

We topped off our meal with what I can only describe as awesome desserts - the perfect end to a perfect meal. This spot has easily made it onto my ""go-to"" list for whenever I'm back in NYC. Looking forward to my next visit!",1
13913,"Title: A Mighty Win for Asian Cuisine at Mighty Bowl

I recently dined at Mighty Bowl, an emerging Asian fast-casual gem in our city, and it's safe to say my lunch experience was exceptional. Opting for their Penang bowl, I was treated to a delightful mix of tender grilled chicken, a perfectly poached egg, fragrant cilantro, spicy sambal, fresh scallions, a refreshing cucumber salad, all tied together with a peanut curry sauce so good it deserves to be bottled and sold.

Mighty Bowl impressed me with their commitment to fresh ingredients, and the portion size delivered great value for the price. The menu offers a pleasing variety of pre-designed bowls, and for those looking for a personal touch, there's the customization option – take note that add-ons aren't limitless, though.

The seating area is cozy, enhancing the casual dining experience, and the staff exuded warmth and friendliness. Mighty Bowl is a spot I undoubtedly plan to revisit to explore more of their tempting bowl offerings.",1

11106,"Title: A Pleasant Surprise at Bleecker Street Pizza

My regular trips to Chip were pleasantly interrupted by the allure of Bleecker Street Pizza, an establishment that exudes that classic NY pizza joint vibe akin to Joe's and Prince Street. Couldn't resist the signs boasting rave reviews, so I ventured in.

Opting for the quintessential cheese slice, I was met with a perfectly proportioned piece, boasting a super crispy crust adorned with a harmonious balance of cheese and sauce. Amidst the bustling Thursday lunch crowd, the staff maintained a super friendly demeanor, catering to a mix of quick bite seekers and those on the hunt for a full pie.

Admittedly, I left with a tinge of regret for not trying the Nonna Maria slice, a crowd favorite that tantalized my curiosity. Fortunately, this gives me the perfect excuse to return. Bleecker Street Pizza, consider me a soon-to-be regular.",1

17215,"Title: A Mixed Bag at an Inventive Chinatown Eatery

I recently dined with my family at a well-talked-about restaurant in New York's Chinatown, intrigued by its reputation for one of the most inventive menus around. Upon arrival for our Saturday night reservation, we were met with a brief wait, suggesting that calling ahead is a wise move in this bustling hotspot.

Initially crammed at a small, chilly table under the AC, the attentive staff swiftly accommodated us with a more comfortable spot. This level of service is a standout in Chinatown.

While the menu teemed with creativity, the execution was inconsistent. We navigated through overpriced offerings like the Wild Octopus with Teriyaki Sauce, which, although texturally pleasant with its soft inside and crunchy exterior, was marred by an excessive saltiness and a disappointingly small portion at $35. The Grilled Berkshire Pork Belly missed the mark, proving tough and chewy for $18.

Some redemption came in the form of the Baby Spinach with Bacon, a pleasing dish that still left us wanting more for $19. The star of the night was the Zucchini Eel Rice at $38. It showcased perfectly cooked eel and delightfully crusty rice, reminiscent of my experiences in Japan.

However, the value proposition dipped with the 'complimentary' appetizer and dessert, which were not only lackluster but quietly included in the taxed and tipped bill.

At around $140 for four, the restaurant's inventiveness might draw you in, but the inconsistency in food quality and pricing might give you pause.",1
10332,"Title: A Pleasant Experience at the District

During our beer hop adventure, we made our third stop at the District, and it was a delightful visit. The ambiance struck the right chord with a lively yet not overcrowded vibe, allowing us to comfortably snag a couple of seats at the bar. Despite the impending closing time within an hour, the setting was perfect for our plan to enjoy a single drink each.

The service was adequate; the bartender had their hands full, which was understandable. Although the service didn't particularly shine, it didn't detract from our overall experience. The great atmosphere and the pleasing crowd more than made up for it. Would certainly recommend the District for a casual drink in a welcoming environment.",1
20393,"Title: Decent Dining, But Lacks Authenticity

I recently dined at a Chinese eatery that left me with mixed feelings. On one hand, the cold noodles and stir-fried pork elbow I ordered were executed quite well. However, I couldn't shake off the impression that the restaurant's claim to Szechuan authenticity wasn't entirely justified, as some dishes leaned more towards the American Chinese palette.

When it comes to value, diners might find the prices a tad steep. The cold noodles came in at $8 with main courses averaging around $25. While the portions didn't leave me hungry, they didn't fully justify the price either, especially when considering what's on offer in the neighborhood.

The saving grace was the exemplary service provided during my visit. Additionally, the establishment prided itself on cleanliness and an overall pleasant ambiance.

In conclusion, while this spot is a solid choice, it doesn't quite stand out from the slew of similar, and perhaps more authentic or economical, options in the vicinity.",1
19363,"I recently visited this restaurant with a craving for soup and decided to try the chicken with tom yum on the menu. Expecting a hearty mix of chicken and vegetables steeped in flavorful broth, I was surprised when the waiter clarified it was broth only. Nonetheless, I looked forward to trying it, hoping for a rich and authentic tom yum experience. Unfortunately, the broth was a huge letdown; it was excessively salty and completely missed the mark on the distinct flavors characteristic of tom yum. The broth lacked depth, and after three disappointing sips, I had to discard the rest. It was a regrettable waste of money and a dampened spirit for soup lovers.",1
13143,"It's located in the UrbanSpace area which I found somewhat confusing as not being a NYer. UrbanSpace has several options of which Two Tablespoons is one. It's vegetarian/vegan in some cases. Basically a food truck in a indoor food truck space. Grab what you want and sit and eat. I was staying nearby and took my food to go. I got the sweet potato and pesto bowl. It certainly has those ingredients, and they were fresh and tasty, but resembled in size of a small side salad anywhere outside of NYC. The service was good, but yeah, $14 for the size of a side salad albeit tasty was pretty disappointing. Unlikely I'll be back.",0
18653,"I recently visited this fantastic new spot in the neighborhood and was thoroughly impressed. The service was outstanding with staff exuding friendliness at every turn.

And if you have a chance, do try the scallion pancakes - I couldn't resist snagging some from a coworker, and they were irresistible. As someone working nearby, it's safe to say this place has earned a regular on their roster. Highly recommend!",1
257,"During our visit, coinciding with a bustling street festival, the restaurant was exceptionally busy, resulting in service that appeared strained.

18774,"I very rarely give out one stars, but I honestly think this place doesn't even deserve one star. A group of friends and I wanted a restaurant to be able to hang out at, catch up and relax at. We found this spot and we were glad to see it had enough space to fit us all and the decor was super cute so we decided to check it out. The menu was pretty good, the staff and management was what dropped this down to a 1 star. Initially, the waiter himself told us that he will break up the bill for us, he offered so we all were glad that he was able to do that and we assumed that's what he was going to do. When the bill came out it was one bill, fine, not a big deal. We broke down the payment on the back of the receipt. My friend was charged TWICE and this wasn't a small amount- she was charged almost $200extra! Since she wasn't given  receipt or anything, we waited to make sure it would get fixed, but the waitress would walk away, ignore us and we would continuously usher her back to fix the error. After waiting for TWO HOURS for this to be resolved, we demanded for the manager to call us. When we talked to the manager it sounded like she didn't even know what was going on. The error was one thing, the ignoring and making us wait for hours, that was what really set us all off, it ruined our whole night! This is in the city, nobody has time like this to waste and a mistake costing hundreds without proper immediate change or proper apology is completely unacceptable! I wouldn't come back here, I do not trust them to run any credit cards or accept anyone's payments, you're better off going to any diner in the area instead of trusting this place with your business.",0
1188,"Title: A Feast of Seafood and Camaraderie at [Restaurant Name]

My visit to [Restaurant Name] was nothing short of an immersive culinary adventure, marked by a whimsical bib-ing ceremony that promised a good time right from the start. As part of a group of five, we opted for two indulgent $99 seafood combos, diving into a succulent array of snow crab legs and lobster that fostered a unique bonding experience as we all ate from a communal plastic bag.

The combos were an abundant treasure trove, with extras like crawfish, corn, potatoes, and shrimp, all coated in delectable sauces. As someone who shies away from spice, both the ghost and house sauces added flavor without overwhelming heat. A standout side dish was the crawfish with egg, while the hot and sour fish soup evoked comforting homemade flavors. The side of Dungeness crab dressed in salty egg yolk was another highlight, rounding out a thoroughly satisfying meal.

The restaurant paired its robust fare with an excellent drink selection and a cozy atmosphere. The staff's cool demeanor contributed positively to the overall experience.

In summary, [Restaurant Name] delivered an unforgettable evening filled with fantastic food, fun, and friendship. It's a place I'm eagerly looking forward to visiting again.",1
10566,"I went to Churutto this evening for dinner and while the food was pretty good, the service was very slow. Ramen doesn't normally take that long. The broth is already cooked (they advertised that it was cooked for up to 8 hours), the noodles only take a few minutes to make, and the toppings are typically prepared in advance. The frustrating thing was that other people arrived after us and their ramen came out before ours. I would have given Churutto four stars had the food not taken as long. Anyway, on to the food.Ordered:Chicken buns ($6)- I enjoyed the chicken buns. It had crispy karaage, a slice of cucumber and a spicy mayo and a brown sauce. There were three chicken pieces in each bun. It was hard to pick it up and eat the bun because some of the chicken would fall out, but the flavors worked well together. Chicken ramen ($13.50)- the broth was a salty and creamy chicken broth, it had pieces of chopped dark meat chicken, al dente noodles, nori, spinach and a soft boiled egg. I'd order this dish again. I may give Churutto another chance, but not when I'm very hungry. They also have poke on the menu and I saw a bunch of people ordered it. That might be something to try.",0
19405,"Title: A Midtown East Gem for Mexican Fare

I've been a regular at this vibrant spot on the corner of 50th and Third, and it never disappoints. Whether grabbing lunch on the go with Meal Pal or dining in, the experience is consistently delightful.

The staff welcomes you with genuine smiles and acknowledgements that add a personal touch to each visit. The menu caters to all, with ample options for vegetarians and meat lovers alike. The drinks and happy hour specials are a magnet for the after-work crowd, creating a lively atmosphere synonymous with fun.

Top dish recommendations include the Baja Fish Tacos, featuring a perfect balance of tangy slaw and generous fish portions, and the Enchiladas Verde, with its tender chicken and irresistible sauce. Snack on the crisp Tacquitos or dive into a hearty Taco Salad with beef—a hit among my co-workers for its well-proportioned ingredients.

With great vibes, music, and décor, this place is a must-visit. And if you're wondering about the lunchtime queue, it's a testament to the food's allure. Don't hesitate to join in; it's worth the wait.",1
17679,"Title: A Ramen Experience Worth the Wait

I've frequented this noodle haven multiple times, and it's easy to understand why there might be a typical wait of 30 minutes - the ramen is simply that good. The menu may be straightforward, but the beauty lies in the ability to fine-tune the flavors to your liking, from the spice level to the saltiness, even the richness of the broth and the doneness of the noodles. It's a culinary canvas awaiting your personal touch.

The restaurant boasts a stall-like design, which serves to offer a cozy sense of privacy as you slurp down your noodles. On my latest visit, I noticed a nifty update to their serving ware; they've swapped to square bowls with lids, an ingenious touch that keeps your ramen piping hot for longer.

For those who lean towards plant-based diets, there's good news: a vegetarian ramen option is now on the menu, ensuring that everyone can partake in the noodle goodness. A pro tip for first-timers: don't skip their egg. It's a game-changer.

An added perk that deserves a shoutout - the no-tipping policy ensures a worry-free dining experience. This place has mastered the art of delivering top-tier ramen without the fuss.",1
12760,"I came here for the chapulines tacos, which I've heard so much about, and they did not disappoint. The grasshoppers were crunchy with an intense smoky, tangy flavor, and had just the right amount of guac on them. The guac tasted fresh too.",0
11399,"Title: Lukewarm Experience at a Hyped Eatery

My recent Friday night visit to a local buzzworthy spot was a mix of mild disappointments peppered with some culinary highs. Securing the last available seating at 8 PM, we found ourselves crammed at a small table, perched on stools that could have benefited from a cushion or two.

The ambience took a hit as we were subjected to an overzealous heater, which had me sweating more than anticipated while dining. The meal, a testament to the term 'average,' did not leave us with any lasting impressions. However, the bottomless fried pickles were a pleasant surprise and proved to be an economical delight at $9.

The Old Fashioned Burger, served with a hearty side of fries, was substantial, though it failed to venture beyond the realm of the usual. A fresh and flavorful side salad provided a refreshing contrast to the otherwise standard fare.

Regrettably, their tempting milkshakes had to be skipped, as the meal filled us to the brim. If a return visit is on the cards, it would be solely to indulge in the dessert that caught our eye. All in all, if you're in for a basic, filling meal and don't mind the heat, it might just be your spot.",1
1972,"My husband and I recently visited a new restaurant that had been featured on Eater, lured by the possibility of a last-minute Saturday night reservation. Upon arrival, we faced initial inattention from the staff and a dimly-lit room that strived for coziness but felt rather incomplete, particularly at the barren bar area.

A bizarre incident involving our reservation required someone to ""run across the street"" for confirmation, which further delayed our seating. Seated next to us, a couple clued us in that it was BYOB, directing us to a nearby liquor store.

We began with polenta cakes and burrata that were unfortunately lackluster—the former bland and the latter watery and accompanied by an insufficient amount of bread for sharing. The main courses, sea bass and short ribs, were well-prepared but offered meager portions that left us still hungry. A well-intentioned suggestion from our waitress led us to delay ordering a side of Brussels sprouts, which ultimately never arrived due to an apparent oversight.

After two hours, hunger pangs still gnawing at us, we opted to cancel the forgotten Brussel sprouts, request the check, and seek satisfaction elsewhere—ending up with pizza as a supplemental meal.

In summary, this restaurant's soft opening seemed premature, marred by service missteps and portion sizes that fail to satisfy. The potential is there, but the kinks need ironing out before I'd consider a return visit.",1

There was so much crispy bacon along with cheesy goodness.  Definitely would get this again in a heart beatThe grilled skirt steak sandwich ($12.95) was good because of the bread, but definitely not worth the price since it had about 2 pieces of steak total in it.

1578,"It's with a heavy heart that I bid farewell to a restaurant that was not only a feast for the eyes but also a sanctuary of warmth and hospitality. Its beautifully lit interior, courtesy of expansive windows welcoming the gentle daylight, set the stage for an impeccable dining experience. The fact that my boyfriend and I were seated instantly, despite the bustling brunch crowd and without a reservation, speaks volumes about the level of service.

The thoughtful touch of paper-lined tables, serving the dual purpose of maintaining cleanliness and providing an artistic outlet, was a delightful surprise. We embraced our inner children, armed with crayons provided by the ever-accommodating hostess, doodling away the wait for our meal. The drinks, particularly the peach Bellini served in a generous wine glass, kept us merry as we awaited our food.

When the dishes arrived, the presentation was stunning, capturing our full attention. My burger was decent—though not extraordinary, the home fries were the true standout, utterly delicious. This locale was a gem of a date spot, one that I truly hope finds its way back to grace the culinary scene once more.",1
10444,"Title: A Sweet Surprise for Every Palate at Max Brenner

I recently joined a celebration for a bodybuilder classmate at Max Brenner, a bit skeptical about finding something for my not-so-sweet tooth. To my delight, the menu offered far more than just desserts, catering to a variety of tastes.

Upon being seated, our attentive waiter, Mansour, expertly recommended the Maxhattan, a flavorful cocktail with just the right amount of kick. Dinner was a treat with my choice of sesame-encrusted salmon over fresh vegetables, complemented by shared pizzas (chicken and veggie options were my pick over the sweet chocolate and caramel version). My peers indulged in a spread of burgers, crepes, pasta, waffles, and various desserts.

It seems the restaurant has expanded its menu to include a variety of meats—a definite plus for carnivores seeking more hearty options. However, the altered taste of the dishes led me to wonder if there's been a change in ownership or perhaps a tweak in the recipes. While the meal was decent, the inconsistency with past dining experiences was palpable.",1
2313,"Title: A Worthy Ramen Experience with a Side of Delight

I recently ventured into the world of ramen at this establishment and found myself quite taken with their spicy red chili ramen. Not the best I've ever savored, yet it packed the punch I crave and filled me up with its robust heartiness. An unconventional twist was the thin, pasta-like noodles, which strayed from the typical ramen thickness. The minced pork didn't quite hit the mark for me, as it seemed to vanish in the broth's depths, but it didn't deter me from polishing off the bowl.

The real star, however, was the Japanese Fried Chicken – a game-changer that propelled my rating to a solid 3.5 stars, if not tipping towards 4. These delectable bites were perfectly savory, small enough to casually snack on, and had a richness in flavor that was impeccably counterpoised by a subtly sweet sauce. Each mouthful was an absolute pleasure, elevating the entire dining experience.",1
11015,"Title: A Michelin Star Experience That Lives Up to Its Hype!

After much anticipation sparked by friends' recommendations and food blog buzz, I finally decided to visit this Michelin-starred gem for a late 10 PM seating on a bustling Saturday night. Though initially greeted by an overbooking hiccup that delayed our table until 11 PM, the evening started to sparkle at the bar with complimentary wine—a gesture that set the tone for the superb service that followed. Opting to stay put, we enjoyed a meal that transcended our expectations.

At $89 per person, the value for the inventive and generous tasting menu was exceptional. As a patron who skips red meat, I was delighted by their flexibility and vegetarian offerings. The culinary journey kicked off with a tantalizing pre-dinner lobster cracker, a bite I could have gladly savored all night. The nettle, rhubarb, and feta dish brought excitement to greens, while the fresh tofu course was an innovative masterpiece, blending crunch and sweetness in a memorable way.

Succulent crab paired with English peas and buckwheat took form in an exquisite, crepe-like dish, and the impeccably seasoned and cooked skate with succulents and blueberry was truly a standout. As for the celery root with mushrooms, it was an unexpected favorite; who knew celery root could masquerade so convincingly as pasta?

The meal concluded on a high note with two desserts. The Meyer lemon, cashew, and sweet milk dessert was likened to a frozen key lime pie but with a distinctive grassy twist. However, the burnt honey and mango stole the show with its toffee-like crunch marrying perfectly with the smooth mango and custard.

In summary, this dining spot not only meets the hype but exceeds it. This establishment is a must-visit, offering a thoughtful and innovative dining experience that will linger in your memory long after the last bite.",1

The true highlight of the experience was the immaculate service; attentive without being intrusive, it elevated the meal considerably. The congees were a delight, each spoonful rich with flavor and perfectly seasoned - a must-try for any visitor.

However, not everything on the menu reached these heights. The rice rolls were on par with the average fare found in nearby dim sum parlors, lacking a standout quality to set them apart. I would particularly advise against ordering the fish skins. Their metallic taste was off-putting and detracted from the overall enjoyment of the meal.",1

10167,"I found out about this restaurant because it's on Seated, but from the start I wasn't too impressed with their menu since it's a bit limited. I came around 7:15 on a Friday night, and the restaurant was packed. The next table wouldn't be available until 8:30, but the server told us that there's a full menu at the bar, so we decided to head over there. A couple stools ended up freeing up within 15 minutes, so we ordered drinks/entrees. I ordered the Best Lei'd Plans ($16) cocktail, and it was delicious. As an entree, I went with the salmon ($28). To be honest, I really didn't think the entree was worth the $. The fish was a bit rubbery and the salad didn't taste like anything. My friend ordered the cheeseburger ($21), and I will say the shoestring fries were good! Overall, this is a cute place to grab a drink, but it's just okay food-wise.",0

True to its name, it packed a heat that surprised me, though it was delightfully rich in flavor and generously peppered. The feast was so abundant that we found ourselves satiated after the first helping. However, while the lower level back corner provided some privacy, it was sweltering, and a more robust air conditioning system would have been appreciated. Overall, for an all-you-can-eat experience, this spot does the trick.",1

If the essence of NYC's diverse culinary landscape could be distilled into a single experience, this unassuming pizza shop might just be it. Tucked away just off the mainstream, it's a treasure revealed to us by the savvy detectives of Yelp, and thank goodness for that. On our third pizza outing in two days, we might have passed it by without a second glance, but what a mistake that would've been!

The restaurant's ambiance struck the perfect chord between bustling and welcoming. At 3pm on a standard weekday, the place was humming with contented diners—a testament to its local favorite status.

Sitting down was swift, and without delay, we plunged into the menu, each claiming a personal pizza. My Margherita, adorned with an extra helping of mushrooms, was a revelation. The simplicity of the dish belied its sophistication—the hallmark of true culinary craftsmanship.

Every bite was a confirmation that sometimes, the most extraordinary experiences require no embellishment. This eatery is a must-visit for anyone who craves authenticity without fanfare. An unequivocal yes to this pizza paradise!",1
19791,"I recently dined at this gem of a restaurant where the flavors of Eastern Europe truly come to life. The borscht was delightful, brimming with taste, and the blinis topped with a generous spoonful of caviar were exquisite. My companions raved about the perfectly seasoned stuffed cabbage and the succulent chicken shashlik, not to mention the hearty meatballs.

When it came to dessert, the Napoleon was a showstopper, while the cheese blinis were a sweet surprise that rounded out the meal beautifully. The restaurant itself boasted a ""shabby chic"" atmosphere that added to the authentic experience. For anyone seeking genuine Eastern European cuisine, this spot is not to be missed.",1
14532,"Title: Underwhelming First Experience

I recently made my first visit to this spot, lured in by the promise of a quick snack. The vegetable pasteles en hojas caught my eye at $3.50 each, but unfortunately, I was met with disappointment. Expecting a hearty vegetable filling, I instead found a scant scattering of corn kernels ensconced in plantain leaves. The price felt steep, especially when compared to the generously stuffed tamales available elsewhere for half as much.

My disenchantment grew when I realized my pastel was reheated in a microwave, resulting in slightly dried out textures. Taste-wise, it wasn't a total miss as there was some savor to be salvaged, especially with the aid of the hot sauce provided. Nonetheless, it failed to hit the mark of deliciousness I had hoped for.

I’m optimistic that other menu items might offer a more satisfying experience and I'm willing to give their coffee a chance in the future. Here's to hoping for a better round two. Happy Yelping!",1
13877,"Upon reflection, I'd rate this establishment just shy of five stars. Initially, my ravenous appetite may have tinted my judgment, but the food indeed was gratifying. The restaurant exudes an air of sophistication, though it lacks the traditional cart service one might expect from a dim sum place.

Our experience began with martinis that were both delightful and effective on empty stomachs. Food service was prompt, featuring dishes like scallion pancakes and pork taro – the latter being particularly outstanding. The scallion pancakes held their own, but the wonton soup had an overpowering fishy taste that was less appealing; I would advise skipping it. However, the pork soup buns were delectable and a redeeming feature.

Hunger may have heightened our senses, and conversation ceased as we thoroughly indulged in our meal, leaving us more than satisfied. For those in TriBeCa with a dim sum craving, this spot is certainly worth checking out.",1
13949,"I had the pleasure of visiting a charming spot today that exuded a delightful French atmosphere, perfect for a casual Friday afternoon snack. The tuna and salmon tartare I tried was nicely executed, hitting all the right notes of fresh flavor. Accompanying the tartare, the winter veggies featuring baby Brussels sprouts, baby carrots, pearl onions, and two varieties of beets were a healthy and light choice that didn't disappoint.

And if the food wasn't enough to brighten the day, the unexpected sight of a super hot model-actor dining on oysters at the next table certainly added an extra spark to the experience. He was, without a doubt, to die for (TDF)! A memorable visit for both the palate and the eyes.",1
16838,"I have never actually been to this location but I ordered it for delivery tonight and I also usually don't do reviews for food that has been delivered but I absolutely have to. They use the best containers to keep their food separate and also to keep it from spilling and to keep it warm. This also may be the first time that I have ever ordered delivery and gotten: napkins, condiments, utensils, and anything else that I needed to eat my meal. Kudos to the people who put together their pick ups for delivery. And in addition to that the food was still warm when it arrived, the order was correct and it was all quite delicious. I would highly recommend the honey chicken every single time.",0
10744,"Title: A Slice of New York Perfection at Lombardi's

Having long craved an authentic New York pizza experience, my perennial disappointment was finally turned around with a visit to Lombardi's in Soho, as recommended by my well-versed New York colleague. Nestled in the heart of Downtown Soho, Lombardi's is conveniently placed amid the bustling boutiques and shops, adding to its charming ambiance.

Upon arrival from our nearby Tribeca accommodations, we were immediately seated without the need for reservations. Our dining trio began with a round of Aperol/Campari spritzes, followed by martinis, expertly served by the wonderful Paul, whose attentive service enhanced our evening.

For starters, the Caesar and house salads were delightful. However, the true stars were the pizzas – a succulent ricotta and pesto and a classic large margherita. Both were divine, but the ricotta and pesto pizza was a surprising favorite, promising to be my go-to on future visits.

The prices were impressively reasonable for the area, but it's worth noting Lombardi's is a cash-only spot, although an ATM is available onsite for a fee. The open kitchen at the back allows for a peek into the bustling, authentic pizza-making process, adding to the establishment's genuine vibe.

The entire experience, from the delectable cuisine to the authentic Italian atmosphere, earns Lombardi's a well-deserved five-star rating. It's clear why my New York-savvy colleague recommended it, and I cannot wait to return to this slice of pizza heaven.",1
18984,"Despite the name, Pho Grand offers an affordable dining experience with entrees ranging from $5-13, accompanied by sizeable portions. My order of sautéed chicken with ginger and scallions was a bit over-sauced, but the chicken itself was tasty after I scraped off the excess. My friend's shrimp fried rice was a standard affair, nothing extraordinary, but satisfactorily executed with tender baby shrimp sprinkled throughout.

The atmosphere of Pho Grand stands out in bustling Chinatown with its unique coziness, reminiscent of a woodsy cabin — a rare find in the area. The service added to the pleasant experience by being quick and considerate, with a welcoming pot of hot tea served upon seating.

Although the dishes we tried were nothing to write home about, the overall experience was positive. I would consider revisiting Pho Grand to sample their pho dishes in the future.",1
20496,"Came here with some friends on a very busy Friday night. Pros:- Very charming (but tiny) space. You feel like you're thrown back a couple decades in Thailand. - Fantastic food, mix of both modern and authentic dishes. We had the Kaduuk (Roasted bone marrow satay with peanut sauce, toast, pickled cucumber & onion $15.00), Mee Krob (Sweetbreads with crispy noodle salad- peanuts, dried shrimp, egg, sawtooth herb & tamarind sauce $15.00), Khao Soi Kaa Gai (Northern style golden curry with homemade egg noodles, chicken leg, pickled mustard greens and fresh turmeric $21), Kao Pat Puu (Traditional crab fried rice with egg, cilantro & lime $25.00) and Coconut Sundae. Everything was cooked perfectly with tons of freshness, flavor, and textures. I personally wasn't a fan of the Sweetbreads as it was too gamey & fishy, but my friends really enjoyed it. Cons:- Due to its Michelin star and tiny space, the wait can be up to 3 hours. We waited 2.5 hours! I'm glad Uncle Boon's is located downtown because we it was easy to kill time at Balzem and The Butcher's Daughter. - The crowd can get pretty pretentious with the yuppie SoHo crowd, who throw fits when they don't receive VIP treatment or have to share tables.",0
130,"Nestled in the cozy corner of the food hall lies a gem offering a unique culinary fusion—imagine the lovechild of pizza and lasagna. We indulged in the 'Puccini's Pick', a delightful concoction of savory sausage, sweet caramelized onions, and crisp red bell pepper. It came paired with a refreshing side of greens and sprouts for a DIY topping experience. The slices were delectably thin, demanding a playful roll-up to savor every bite. This whimsical eatery is certainly worth a visit for an enjoyable, out-of-the-ordinary meal. Delicious and memorable!",1
19469,"Title: Fresh and Trendy Poke Haven Just Steps from the Office

I recently stumbled upon a remarkable poke spot, a mere five-minute walk from my workspace, and I'm absolutely thrilled. The recommendation came from a coworker, and it's quickly become my go-to for possibly slightly pricey but utterly scrumptious poke bowls.

The ambiance of this eatery is nothing short of charming and stylish, with a neon sign adding to its trendy vibe. The space isn't vast, but it's comfortably equipped with a few tables; as long as you avoid the predictable lunch rush between 12:00-1:00, seating is readily available.

The menu keeps it simple and user-friendly, featuring several pre-curated bowls alongside the ever-popular ""build your own"" option. On my initial visit, I opted for The Classic Hawaiian—a delightful blend of well-marinated tuna and salmon that highlighted the freshness of the fish. But the real star for me was the marinated kale and vegetable noodles, a base that outshone the usual suspects like brown rice or mixed greens. Each topping, from the tangy seaweed salad to the crunchy onion crisps, contributed to an explosion of flavors and textures.

For anyone with a penchant for poke, this spot is a must-try. I'm convinced there's something here for every poke enthusiast to love!",1
1377,"Came here for lunch. Fast service and big portions for the price you pay. I usually get #1 but decided to try something new. We got #9 pho with grilled pork chop and #91 Barbecue pork chop with rice. Both were super satisfying and would definitely reorder. Great place for a winter day when you just want something to warm you up. The lemonade soda is also really good, tangy and sweet. Tried other options on the menu and it's always a hit.",0
13056,"Title: A Korean BBQ Experience That Sets the Bar High at Yoon Haeundae Galbi

My dining companions and I have frequented many Korean BBQ spots, but Yoon Haeundae Galbi stands out as the pinnacle of our experiences. Bringing friends from out of town who were new to the Korean BBQ scene, we hoped for excellence, and we weren't disappointed.

The service was impeccable. Our waiter struck a rare balance of attentiveness and discretion, expertly handling the grill and cooking our selections to perfection without ever feeling intrusive.

As for the cuisine, we opted for the Prime Package and the Marinated Package based on our waiter's recommendation for our party of six. The portions were spot on, and every piece of meat was succulent and rich in flavor. The quality of the food and the overall dining experience have left a lasting impression on our first-timer friends, prompting eager discussions about our next visit. Yoon Haeundae Galbi has not only met but exceeded our expectations, creating a memorable evening for all.",1
11571,"In my endless quest to try all of the classic NYC steakhouses, this time it was Keen's turn. If you're from NJ like me, it's location is great....just a few blocks from the Lincoln Tunnel. (note: they validate the parking garage across the street, instead of $70, I paid only $20!!!!)Keen's opened in what was once an old residential building back in 1885. All meats are PRIME and dry aged.It is the last restaurant in NYC to still serve mutton ( sheep meat...grown up lamb). The decor and atmosphere is like a museum.... just old school charming.Dining rooms on all floors. Rich carpets and wood paneling....paintings, old photos and 90,000 clay smoking pipes hanging from the ceiling for use back in the day when an after dinner pipe smoke was the norm.THE DRINKSI have to mention the drinks...first, the bar claims to have one of the largest , best single malt Scotch selections in NYC..so 'nuff said.However, there is a daily 'cocktail list' that is on each table with some great creations from their very experienced bartenders. I suggest you try one.We actually tried one that wasn't on the current list, but on an old one...it was recommended to me since I like whiskey based drinks like an Old Fashion. It's called the Improved Highlander made with Dewar's Scotch, Absinthe, maraschino, simple syrup, bitters served chilled, straight up, in a martini glass with a lemon twist.....OMG !.....Fantastic! little smokey, little sweet, little anise flavor...went down real well...we had a bunch of these !THE FOOD-APPS......we tried.Nothing to rave about on any point. all of these were fresh with a decent sized portion. We all shared. I think the salmon was the winner of the 3:--Shrimp Louie: small shrimp & tomatoes served on a half avocado in a vinaigrette--Crab cocktail--house cured salmon with capers and rye bread points.THE FOOD--ENTREES......we tried.---T-Bone was very good per the diner..he didn't seem impressed.---Well done, end cut of a Kings cut Prime Rib was the best! charred and crisp on the outside and not dry at all on the inside..its from the great marbling of fat in this cut of meat. even well done is juicy--Mutton chop..OK I tried it..I had too. I love lamb to begin with.I was disappointed, but that's ok. The flavor was good, Not any of that gaminess you get in lamb. But the meat is difficult to cut off since it is so close to the bone ( see picture). and the saddle portion is very fatty...too much work..not enough meat...next time I'll get the double cut lamb chops!.....and all the sides we tried were also very good:boiled potatoes in parsley & buttercarrots in brown buttercreamed spinach was a good version of the classic steak house side.We skipped dessert.",0
15549,"I have not had any of the other dumplings aside from the chicken with green mole dumplings, so this review is specifically for those.The guy at the counter was not friendly whatsoever, but the dumplings were amazing, so forget about the worker. It was weird to taste dumplings that were not in the Asian category, but I loved these so much. They were bursting with flavor, the green mole was creamy and went perfectly with the dumplings. And I loved their secret sauce on the table.I wish I would've been able to taste other months' special dumplings. Please open a location in San Francisco!!",0
14624,"A fun little restaurant with really good xialongbao as most have said on here. That said, don't miss the fried tiny buns (生煎包). They are delightfully and lightly fried and yet still flavorful. The xlb soup is decent--not the best I've had but still excellent. The skin is wonderfully thin and QQ. The beef scallion pancakes were my next favorite dish. The chicken soft noodles were good too, but maybe a little too heavy handed with the sauce for my tastes. The salt and pepper squid was just okay and at $15.50, definitely something you can skip.A fun quirk about this restaurant (other than that it's cash or AmEx only) is that you can put your gear in your seats that double as storage cubes.The only bummer was that we didn't have enough cash to cover our bill and had to run to the nearest ATM. We were only short $10. Those darn squid!",0
20203,"Title: A Quirky Spot with Hits and Misses - Perfect for Casual Group Dining

I recently visited this charmingly casual restaurant with a group of friends and found it to be a delightful mix of interesting décor and eclectic cuisine. Upon arrival, we were immediately escorted to our reserved seating, though the unevenness of the benches was slightly off-putting.

True to the whimsical atmosphere, pig-themed decorations adorned the walls, menus, and shelves, adding a touch of playfulness to the experience. Our culinary adventure spanned from small plates to hearty entrees, with the intent of sampling a diverse range of the menu's offerings.

A standout for me was the deep-fried Brussel sprouts, which were an unexpected hit - crispy, flavorful, and addictive. They were the highlight of my meal, and I'd return just for another taste. The poached chicken with chili dressing was satisfactory, though it fell short of remarkable in my book.

The soup dumplings tantalized with their rich broth, though the inconsistent skin thickness detracted slightly from the overall enjoyment. However, the peanut noodles presented an intriguing twist that commanded attention.

Our entree selections included the pig heaven pork and spare ribs, which did not disappoint - both were savory masterpieces well worth ordering. While I can't comment much on the fish dishes, the general consensus was that they were well-executed. The shrimp dishes, paired with lackluster lettuce, didn't live up to my expectations, leaving room for improvement in the accompaniment department.

In summary, while there were some minor drawbacks, the restaurant offers a pleasant atmosphere with several notable dishes that make it worth a revisit. Perfect for group outings, there's enough variety to please most palates, especially if you're in the mood for something a little different.",1
17249,"2.5 stars for the overall omakase experience.5 stars added for experimenting with different ingredientsI really want to like this place but a lot was left to be desired after the meal. The omakase itself is really reasonably priced at 125 for 17 courses but would suggest not getting the tea which is $7 and it was nothing special and something I can get from a tea bag from the Japanese market. If you're looking for just OK sushi then this place is fine, but if you're like me and looking for an authentic omakase and want to experience refined flavors then you will be very disappointed like I was. None of the courses were memorable but I did appreciate them experimenting with different flavors, salts, sauces and ingredients. However, some of the flavors were just so odd and off it completely covered the taste of the fish. The fish they used was overall fresh but my biggest complaint is the rice to fish ratio which was completely off. There was very little rice with each piece which made the texture of the overall sushi very odd. All you could taste was the slab of fish and a few grains of poorly cooked rice that lacked the taste of vinegar and flavor. While they use a lot of different types of fish some of them were not the top notch seafood that some places use. For example, instead of Hokkaido uni it was uni from Maine which does not have the same sweetness and creamy texture. There were some pieces that confused me so much like the pepper tuna with teriyaki onion which in my opinion had no business in being part of an omakase course. That was a piece I find in a takeout sushi joint and needed a lot of refinement before it can be offered as part of an omakase course. Presentation of the pieces here was also pretty sloppy. Some pieces had the rice facing the side and the fish was sliding off. As for the service it was fine but did not appreciate the servers reaching over my shoulder in the already very tight space and almost spilling sauce and tea all over me. Also did not like that tip percentages are preset and there is no option to choose your own percentage. Sadly will not be compelled to come back here even at the very reasonable price point. Hope they can make some major refinements to their sushi and make this a worthwhile omakase experience for their patrons. At best this place serves OK sushi, but would certainly do not think what I had is worthwhile to be called omakase.",0
14003,"When you ask me for suggestions of where to eat in NYC, remember Good Enough to Eat. My suggestion is come on a weekday because on weekends the line is around the block. I've been coming here for years. All fresh local source food. This is their only location. They have a great product and want to keep their energy on this precious (my word) establishment. I have never met a hostess or server that didn't make me feel welcome and at home. My comfort is their priority. Every year after my eye exam I treat myself brunch. It takes a while for my dilated eyes to adjust to the menu and my photos may not be the best. I'm welcome to take my time and relax a while after I pig out. So to sum it up, service and atmosphere are like being cared for by a loving companion when you're ill! As for the food. I've had the Corned Beef Hash, the Pancakes, and several times my favorite Bacon Waffles. They have no problem substituting the salad for the fruit that comes with the waffles. The salad was perfect for me. No tomato! And I forgot to tell them I'm allergic. When I needed extra Strawberry Butter it was provided. It's the best butter I've ever eaten. As for the deserts, if you have room, they're all fresh made. My favorites are the German Chocolate Cake and the Coconut Cake. I've tried the pie but I'm not much of a pie eater unless it's Peanut Butter Pie. Whatever I've eaten has been well worth the price for fresh homemade baked goods. All I can tell you in summary is:1. Delicious Menu.2. Excellent Service and a atmosphere.  3. Reasonable price for the quality and care in preparation. I'm going back for desert soon. I highly recommend you visit GETE!",0
15845,"I was catfished by the high Yelp reviews. Sapori D'Italia was nearly empty when I stopped by and perhaps that should have been my first sign. But, let's get to the food, which is what we're all interested in. The margherita pizza was not what one would expect: decent ingredients on a high school cafeteria pizza crust (you know the one). I think they just bombarded the crust with cheese in an effort to cover it up. I even prefer cauliflower crust. The carbonara needs its own paragraph. The carbonara was so salty that I could literally stomach two bites. When I mentioned it to the waiter, he said that carbonara is supposed to be salty, and pretty much told me not to order it if I didn't like salty food. I've had carbonara before - it's actually one of my favorite pasta dishes - and it's never been this salty and inedible. I wanted to ask the waiters to try the carbonara, but they were pretty nice overall, so I felt bad subjecting them to the salty carbonara. In the end, they offered me a free dessert, which we rejected. $20 is a steep price to pay for two bites of pasta, but I wanted to leave quickly, so I just paid up and left.The alla norma was overall decent (and edible lol), and the only reason this restaurant gets more than one star.",0
18290,"Title: A One-Timer at 'Build-a-Bowl'

I popped into this restaurant for a lunchtime experiment, intrigued by the idea of crafting my own bowl. Opting for a white rice base, I topped it with shrimp, radish, cucumber, sweet onion, and embellished with a blend of spicy mayo, crunchy onions, wasabi peas, and crab salad — quite the ensemble.

While the flavors were good, the quantity was overwhelming. I struggled with the white rice, leaving a mound untouched. The bowl’s design made it tricky to stir the contents, and with the lid refusing to contain the mountain of food, I pondered the possibility of splitting it into two meals for future reference.

A suggestion to the management: consider downsizing the portions to reduce prices. This place isn't a regular on my must-eat list, primarily due to its premium cost. With a more wallet-friendly approach, I might be tempted to drop by more often.",1
15259,"Have you ever visited a noodle soup on a cold winter day for a hot bowl of wonton noodle soup? That was my expectation for HK Wonton Garden. Unfortunately they let me down. I ordered a BBQ Pork & Wonton Noodle soup but sadly it was not hot at all. The temperature of the soup was luke warm at best. Even though the dish was still flavorful the temperature of the meal was a big let down especially because of the weather at the time. The other downside is they overcharged me for the meal. I ordered the BBQ pork with wonton noodle soup, Har Kow and the BBQ Pork Buns. The total came out to $20.98. The noodle was $7.75, Har Kow was $5.75 and the BBQ Pork Bun was $3. The total pre-tax is $16.50. I doubt it should be pass $20 with tax. Make sure you double check your bill before heading out. I really wanted to like this place because of the mom & pop feel. The menu is actually quite big. They serve anything from noodles to dim sum to rice plates to other traditional Chinese entrees. The establishment is quite old but it's got the retro Hong Kong style cafe feel. Most tables can only fit 4-5 people max. If you got a party larger than 4-5 it'll be difficult for them to accommodate your party.",0
12818,"Ise Restaurant is a traditional Japanese restaurant that serves soba noodles and different combinations of food with it. We came to this restaurant for good luck for the New Year. It is said that if you eat noodles on New Year's Eve you will enjoy good luck for the year ahead. So, of course, we had to do this for 2020. I ordered the soba noodles with tempura and sashimi. It also comes with a bowl of rice as well. The portion size is quite large and overall it was very enjoyable. I feel like even though I'm not Japanese I do enjoy hearing about different cultures and what they do for the New Year. It was my first time at this spot and the food was good and so was the service. Something new and different for me but I'm glad I was able to do it for the New Year Ever. Tip- Also you can make reservations for this restaurant. Wishing everyone good luck for this year.",0
1307,"This is one of my favorite Cantonese restaurants in the city, and when we have family dinners this is our go-to spot. It's not the casual rice casserole and congee kind of place, more like the banquet-style big-group kind. I've only ever come for dinner, not dim sum, and their dishes are well-seasoned, tasty, and almost always on point.The main reasons for my love are A) the sablefish in eel sauce and B) the giant cooked oysters with black bean sauce. The fish arrives still bubbling and wrapped in aluminum foil. It's soft and tender, and the sauce is so delicious, especially together with the fish over a spoonful of rice. Honestly, I could probably eat that sauce over most things, but it works especially well here. The oysters with black bean sauce also come with vermicelli noodles and, sometimes, chopped up peppers. They cost $4 each, but they're well worth the price for the size and flavors.Other standouts include the sauteed pea shoots with garlic, crispy chicken with garlic, clams in black bean sauce, Cantonese-style lobster with ginger and scallion, T-bone steak, and lamb chops. We've also tried one of their specials: two lobsters with sticky rice. I've had this dish at another Cantonese place in Brooklyn Chinatown, and the sticky rice is much better here, but still not that soft, moist, glutinous kind I love. Maybe it's too hard to get that texture just right while also cooking it with the lobster (which is great as always).Make sure to save room for some dessert soup and oranges at the end. They used to serve the red bean kind, but I think it's green bean now, which is still pretty good. Make sure to eat the oranges before and not after the soup or you'll get Warheads face.",0

10098,"This is a 5 star worthy restaurant even considering it's a vegetarian/vegan-only one. Came with a group of 5 for a bday celebration. Interior and decor is really nice. Trendy, boho-chic vibe. Food is, for the most part, excellent. The menu changes seasonally so some of these items may not be available still.Top items:- Beluga Lentils with chili oil and black vinegar, yams, broccoli stems, cilantro. I wouldn't normally order this because how good can lentils be? Well I was so wrong. Incredible flavor in this dish. Just trust me on this.- Dosa with smoky eggplant, tomato chutney, coconut yogurt, cilantro. The flavor of the eggplant combined with the tomato was really intense. It also just melted in my mouth. Get this dish. Other notable items:- Half or Whole Roasted Cauliflower with turmeric-tahini and pistachios. If you don't like cauliflower, you probably won't like this dish. It's just doused in oil and roasted. But it's really pretty and acts as a good centerpiece for the table. For all you insta-h**s out there.- Mushroom walnut bolognese with carrot paccheri, celery, mint leaf. Recommend for the meat lovers who were dragged to this restaurant.- Green Chickpea Hummus with thai basil, fresh pita or crudité. Great starter dish. The hummus itself is great - tastes like vegetables (in a good way)Drinks: I didn't order any of them, but I tried my friend's and it was just okay. She didn't even finish it. So not worth the price in my opinion.The service was... interesting. Our server was attentive but pushy. He kept on saying we should order more food and recommended some dishes kinda forcefully. To the point where we were getting uncomfortable. We also had an outside cake delivered to the restaurant that was supposed to come out as a surprise. But they forgot about it or something and we had to ask the server to bring out the cake in front of the bday girl, which defeats the purpose. Oh well. I'd still make a repeat visit if I'm back in the city. It's pricey, but the food is surprisingly filling and definitely delicious.",0

3536,"During a recent jaunt for a quick lunch, I had the pleasure of visiting this charming eatery which instantly won me over with its energetic ambiance and Instagram-worthy nooks, perfect for a mid-day photo op. The vibrancy of the place makes it an ideal spot for both a casual meal and a work session, as evidenced by patrons comfortably set up with their laptops.

My sister and I were momentarily bewildered by the tantalizing menu options but eventually settled on the pesto meatball sub, mac and cheese, and chicken tenders. The pesto meatball sub was the clear standout – a fusion of bold pesto flavors on a fluffy potato sub roll was simply divine. The mac and cheese, topped with shiitake bacon bits, was satisfactory, though it didn't quite hit the mark for me. As for the chicken tenders, they were on par with other vegan tenders I've had, but the variety of dipping sauces was a nice touch.

Observing the flurry of salads being ordered around us, I'm tempted to try one on my next visit. The dessert showcase, brimming with vegan sweets, is also on my must-try list. With a total bill of $26 for three dishes in NYC, the pricing was surprisingly on the lower end for vegan fare.

Finding parking may be a bit of a hunt, but it's a non-issue for those opting for public transit. Service was brisk and efficient, complementing the laid-back atmosphere. I highly recommend giving the pesto meatball sub a try; it’s certainly a menu highlight not to be missed.",1
21037,"My partner and I ventured into this cozy spot around midnight amidst the freezing weather, craving the warmth of hot ramen. Greeted with a check-in offer of popcorn chicken, we found ourselves delighted by its tender, juicy bites. I chose the spicy miso with chicken, which was truly impressive with its perfectly pitched spice levels, although I retrospectively pined for the pork version. My partner's kimchi ramen was satisfactory but surprisingly less fiery than mine, resulting in him happily sharing mine as well. We were both charmed by the cute interior and impressed by the attentive service. This place has definitely earned a return visit from us.",1
1046,"During my recent wanderings through NYC, I was delighted to discover an exceptional dim sum restaurant that rivals my beloved Californian spots. The menu boasts all of the classic favorites, executed with impressive quality. Even amid the bustling Saturday lunch rush, my experience was enhanced by the surprisingly spacious interior, attentive service, and rapid arrival of dishes.

Highlights include the Shrimp Har Gow, with its delicate wrapper and succulent shrimp, perfectly paired with a sweet soy sauce. While the Crab & Pork Xiao Long Bao was more pork-leaning, the soup within was delightfully abundant. The lightness of the Shrimp Rice Rolls and their sweet sauce brought a pleasant balance to the meal. The standout was undoubtedly the Crispy Pork Spare Ribs—a unique twist on a dim sum staple that lived up to its popularity among fellow diners.

Although the Chrysanthemum Tea was a delightful treat, its $8 price tag makes it a luxury best shared. Despite the NYC premium, this eatery is a must-visit for any dim sum enthusiast.",1
17091,"Absolutely lives up to the buzz! A bit on the greasy side, but it's a small price to pay for the incredible flavors.

In a nutshell: a fast, convenient, and utterly scrumptious experience!",1
10760,"I recently had the pleasure of visiting a charming restaurant where I decided to venture into the world of burrata – and, frankly, I regret not trying it sooner. As someone striving for a balance of health and flavor, the burrata salad truly spoke to me. It did not disappoint; what a revelation! The lush creaminess of the cheese paired with the crispness of the greens, all tied together with a rich balsamic glaze and the pop of pomegranate seeds, was divine. The flavors created a symphony in my mouth – an indulgent, heavenly experience. Admittedly, the price tag was a bit steep, but the culinary delight justified the expense. A must-try for anyone who appreciates the finer tastes in life.",1
19789,"Title: A One-Time Veggie Adventure in NYC

After much anticipation fueled by friends' recommendations, I finally visited one of New York City's many vegan/vegetarian eateries. Regrettably, this establishment didn't live up to the exceptional standard set by the city's other plant-based haunts, earning it a one-time-visit badge from myself.

My dining experience started on a high note, with a convenient location right next to a train station, the modern touch of free WiFi, and a commendable commitment to inclusivity with gender-neutral bathrooms that were notably tidy (8/10 for cleanliness).

The young host shone with friendliness and attentiveness, eagerly assisting with our menu queries. However, the restaurant's policy of charging extra for substitutions and the self-service approach of ordering at the register and waiting to be summoned for food pickup left me with mixed feelings about the service structure.

As for the food, my table included the Tomato Basil Soup, Air Baked Fries, The Classic Burger, and, much to my disappointment, the Mac N' Cheese. The latter, a dish I had eagerly anticipated, fell flat and barely scraped a 2/10 in terms of taste. The rest of the meal hovered around mediocrity – not bad, but not remarkable either.

While this visit didn't hit the mark for me, perhaps others might find their comfort food here. However, I'll be continuing my quest for my go-to vegan spot elsewhere in the city.",1
14570,"This place is pretty much my go-to place if I'm near Washington Square Park. I've been here many times but this time I came here for dinner with a group of 8 people on a Monday night.  They accommodated us with barely any wait.  We ordered 2 appetizer platters (3 appetizers: curry puff, chicken satay, fried calamari), whole fried red snapper with papaya salad, roast duck with udon noodles, spicy basil fried rice with grilled chicken, kua gai noodles, shrimp with vermicelli noodles in a clay pot, and chicken massaman curry.  All the dishes were cooked well and flavorful.  The best dish was the whole fried red snapper with papaya salad.  I always enjoy the kua gai noodles and spicy basil fried rice as well.  The portions were large and the prices were decent.  Also, you can get 10% off your check if you pay with cash.  FYI - you get Thai iced tea for $1 with Yelp check in.",0
17804,"Disappointing best describes my recent experience at Villa Pizza. In search of authentic New York-style pizza, I found their offerings to be quite uninspiring. My visit there was merely a pit stop to satiate hunger pangs on a walk from Penn Station to the U.S.S. Intrepid. The prices compounded the letdown, with a slice of mushroom pizza and a bottle of water costing upward of $10. Unfortunately, Villa Pizza didn't live up to the culinary expectations set by the city's rich pizza reputation.",1
20930,"I recently visited a pizza restaurant that left a remarkable impression. The quality of the pizza was exceptional - both the sauce and the toppings boasted amazing flavors, elevating the entire dining experience. The service matched the high standard of the food; the staff was attentive and efficient, significantly enhancing our meal. The pizza was so delightful that we couldn't resist grabbing an extra pie to go, and I must say, it was just as delicious the next day. My only regret is that this gem of a place isn't located nearer to me, but despite the distance, I am already looking forward to my next visit. Highly recommend for fellow pizza enthusiasts!",1
19492,We were looking for a cool bar to grab a few drinks after our dinner in easy village.  Girlfriend had been here before and I had heard of it as well because of the hidden entrance through the jewelry shop.  Would definitely recommend this speakeasy! We had a few drinks and decided to try their devils food dessert and it was amazing!  The space is surprisingly big with two floors.  Perfect for a small group too.  Will definitely be returning.,0
15199,I took my wife here for her birthday and I really wanted to do something special for her.  The restaurant is beautiful and the ambiance is amazing.  They have different selections for dinner you can choose the four course meal pre fixe or the seven course pre fixe.  We chose the four course because we had to go to a broadway show.  I chose the sea scallops as my first meal and my wife chose the tuna.  The scallops meal for he was ok perhaps they were more raw than I had anticipated and I felt nervous about the rest of the meal.  My wife had tuna and it looked amazing presentation wise and taste wise.  I had the flambé foi gras and my wife had the crab cakes.  I am a huge fan of fois gras and was disappointed with it while it tastes good and was perfectly cooked it just lacked something my wife tasted it and she preferred it more than her own dish so we switched and I loved the crab it had Brined olives mixed in and I thought it tasted wonderful.  The third course I had the wagyu beef and my wife had the quail.  This was my favorite part of the meal.  While the portion of the beef was not a lot the quality was absolutely amazing.  The sauce that complimented the wagyu was just heavenly.  My wife's quail was equally amazing.  Lastly was the dessert and I had told them it was my wife's birthday so they brought out a dessert on the house for her.  All of the desserts were simply amazing.  We had cocktails which were amazing you must must must try the white cosmopolitan the presentation of the drinks alone was beautiful.  We had red wine with our meals and they were good also.  The fresh baked bread is heavenly.  Lastly the customer service and attention to detail is top notch.  Everyone was so nice and wonderful to us.  I absolutely will be coming back here.  Michellin Star  amazing this is a place you should dine at atleast once in your life.  If you prefer big portions of fat filled food this is not the place for you.  This is quality and superior ambiance.,0
19773,"Title: Consistently Satisfying Breakfast, Mixed Feelings on Lunch

I've become a regular at this eatery for my morning and midday meals, and I'm always drawn back by their breakfast offerings. The egg white omelette with avocado is my go-to and comes at a reasonable $6. Generous portions keep me fueled for hours, and the kitchen staff is accommodating, using Pam spray upon request and ensuring the omelette is well-done for my on-the-go needs. A shoutout is deserved for the morning crew, who are exceptionally friendly and committed to perfecting my order every time, solidifying a 5/5 experience for breakfast.

However, lunchtime has a different tale to tell. Although the lunch buffet's concept of picking and combining dishes is appealing, the execution falls short, especially considering the steep pricing. My recent lunch consisting of salmon, cauliflower, and a hefty serving of Caesar salad set me back $15, which seemed excessive. A simpler choice from the salad bar would have been more cost-effective.

While the bathroom facilities are decent and above average in cleanliness, the checkout experience is hit-or-miss. Among the cashiers, the disparity in customer service is notable; one is always personable and engaging, while the other seems perpetually disgruntled.

In summary, the eatery shines brightly at breakfast but loses some of its luster by lunchtime, and the service, although generally good, is inconsistent.",1
19415,"Ate here for lunch.  Nothing special and high prices.   We were a party of six and had a mix of salads, sushi, and fried chicken.  Rave reviews about the bloody Mary's - they don't have ranch dressing",0

16043,"+.5 for serviceThis place has won my heart for XLB. No more Joe's, no more Nan Xiang, I'm now a disciple for The Bao every time I'm in NYC. I originally wanted to try Yu Garden, but I ended up too far from Flushing that night so this was the backup option.I arrived at 8:30pm with my family, and sure enough there was a 4-seater table available. Perfect! All I needed to do was stare at the dim sum section. Crab Meat Xiao Long Bao: Check. Chocolate Xiao Long Bao: Check. I also added crispy beef and a veggie side dish (mind you we weren't that hungry at all since we had a late lunch that day).The crab meat xiao long bao was the second best XLB I've ever eaten (nothing compares to the XLBs at DTF in LA, but this came awfully close). I'd be more than happy to devour only this XLB as dinner, lol. They also did a good job with the veggies here, especially the water spinach. The crispy beef...is a hard pass. The chocolate XLB was a very interesting concept, but not something I'll have a second time (it's basically nutella with bananas).Service was excellent despite the noise ambience here (it gets really loud, almost izakaya loud). Nonetheless, this is your place for XLB in NYC, despite the 3.5/5 overall review.",0
15080,"The reviews don't lie, this place lives up to the hype! This is my favorite Thai place in the city. Everything I've had here is SO delicious and flavorful, and significantly better than some of the more fancy Thai places I've been to in the city. Although it's a small place, the ambiance is very nice and it feels more upscale even though the prices are pretty standard. The drinks here were GREAT. The bartender was so knowledgeable about every single drink, offered her recommendations, and explained how each was made. She also did some cool tricks with fire to add to the flavor of certain drinks which added a lot to the drink. There's usually a wait even on weekdays, but it usually moves pretty fast. Definitely recommend, it's worth the wait!",0
12208,"Title: A Refreshing Respite with Authentic Flavors in Chinatown

I've become a regular at this gem in Chinatown, a place that has consistently served up classic Vietnamese-Chinese cuisine like phos, buns, and summer rolls. The availability of banh xeo, a less common find, further cements its authenticity. On my last visit amidst a sweltering NYC heatwave, I opted for a cooling pork banh mi and an iced Vietnamese coffee, ordered via Yelp/Grubhub for pickup. Despite the early arrival and a brief wait, the strong AC inside was a welcome comfort.

One small snag was the missed opportunity to specify the spice level for my banh mi; it arrived without any heat. It wasn't a dealbreaker as I spruced it up with some sriracha at home. The meal was overall very satisfying. Just remember to mention your spice preference when ordering takeout. Prices were reasonable—$7.75 for the banh mi and $3.50 for the coffee—making this spot hard to beat for an authentic, affordable bite in the heart of the city.",1
16329,"Lovely vegan restaurant with good service and creative molecular gastronomy-esque food.  The place felt like a dark, chic subterranean rain forest, nice date-y vibes.Food was generally good.  I especially loved the kelp noodles which were very memorable and very delicious but hard to describe.  The kimchi dumplings were my second favorite dish, also pretty interesting.  Personally I didn't quite like the sweet and sour maitake mushrooms as much, as i found the sauce to be a bit overwhelming.  New tiramisu dessert was an interesting concept though I thought was just ok.  Instead of a tiramisu (very soft), has texture like a soft energy bar.  I think it might have been better with a creamier texture.Overall one of the more memorable vegan restaurant experiences.  A good place to impress your vegan friend with.",0
16072,"PSP was on the bucket list for a little while now. We decided to call up and pick up one of their famous spicy pepperoni squares. The wait was only about 5 minutes once we got there. Friendly staff always helps make it a better experience. 2 square pies were about $71 plus tip. Not a cheap pizza by any means. One spicy one non. Both pepperoni. The first flavor is sweet when it hits your mouth. The sauce has lots of sugar in it. That is obvious. The spice is mild but works very good. You can taste the freshness of the ingredients. Light crunch underneath, nice light chew to the dough. And the star is the pepperoni ( of course). Lots and lots of that good pepperoni. Overall it was a great pie and glad we came. The neighborhood has great pizza and this place is up there with the best of them. Go eat some pizza, friends. ENJOY!!!",0
15219,"Diner with pizzazz. Modern, contemporary diner  with great cocktails. I passed this place many times but assumed it was just another diner. Not at all!  We went in for late night food and I was pleasantly surprised.  Contemporary decor and a stocked, lit up bar.

We were promptly seated (we had a reservation). The room ambiance is very comfortable and the sound level was reasonable, even though the room was crowded. The cocktails were outstanding. We enjoyed the Working Class Hero - with corn cob smoke.  The small plates were thoughtful.  The flatbread and pork belly tostada were excellent. The buffalo chicken spring rolls were not quite as tasty.",0
11729,"On a spontaneous Friday evening out with my daughters, we ventured to this spot lured by an enticing photo of their Mac and Cheese Burger. To our delight, we discovered that it lived up to the hype. While the burger was daunting in size, it was undeniably satisfying, something I'd suggest sampling at least once. The quick seating, a mere five-minute wait—likely due to the club-goers' absence—was an unexpected pleasure, rounding off a very enjoyable dining experience.",1
10278,"Famous Ben's - Home of NYC's best Sicilian slice. So they say on the window. After eating ice cream and then feeling that wasn't a justified enough of a dinner my friend and I saw across the street the sign, promising to be the best and wandered in while on the way to the train. It wasn't a poor life decision. I'm always more than happy to check out a new pizza place in the city that I haven't been to like some sick little obstacle course you have to run through. I've actually been to a Ben's pizza before further out in the west village. Not sure if they are affiliated in any kind of way but I remember the other Ben's being not too shabby and that this was probably worth a shot as well.The options are pretty exciting and they have more than just Sicilian slices. Upside down slices, grandma, white pies, pepperoni, hawaiian, vegetable, chicken, broccoli, ziti on pizza, etc. etc. I think the cheapest for slices I saw was $3.75. The Sicilian was $4. Most other slices were around $5-5.50 for the specialty toppings which was kind of disappointing but I get it; we're not in Kansas. We went in with $8 worth of pizza . . . . each. . . . no regrets. The amount of dripping cheese and sauce on the rich crusty bread was insane. The amount of powdered garlic and red pepper flakes I loaded onto it also insane. Best I've ever had? Totally not sure because I don't usually go for a Sicilian slice but this was pretty great. I would totally come back for a slab if I were nearby. They also make their own jarred sauce which I thought was pretty cool and a sign that they've definitely established themselves in the neighborhood.",0
13215,"Radiance doesn't have the most amazing food, but I'm appreciative of a solid dim sum spot close to our apartment. As stated in other reviews, the restaurant is a nicer restaurant especially compared to dim sum restaurants in Chinatown or Flushing. We decided to try this restaurant out on a weekend and were able to be seated immediately. We ordered a couple of the dim sum items and thought they were pretty good although a bit bland. The food is on the pricier side due to location and the fact that this is a proper sit-down restaurant.They are a more traditional restaurant instead of being trendy. They have a huge selection of teas which is probably an area where they shine. The restaurant is decorated in a very traditional Chinese fashion. We had no issues with the service which wasn't overbearing but attentive.",0
15369,"Title: A Delightful Veggie Experience in Midtown

I recently dined at this Vietnamese spot in midtown NYC and was thoroughly impressed by their vegetarian offerings. The mushroom tofu summer rolls had a deliciously savory filling, though the skin was slightly too soft, causing them to fall apart. Nonetheless, it was a minor hiccup in an otherwise delightful appetizer. The tofu mushroom vermicelli bowl was also a hit—skipping the fish sauce didn't diminish its flavor one bit. The portions were generous, allowing for a second meal to take home, which is always a plus.

The pricing is quite reasonable for the area: $6 for the summer rolls and $9 for the vermicelli bowl is a steal in midtown. While I didn't get a chance to try their banh mi or pho, I'll definitely consider them in future visits. The decor added to the pleasant atmosphere with charming dark wood tables and a spacious feel.

For those working nearby, this restaurant is perfect for a quick and satisfying lunch. The service was swift, with food arriving in about 15 minutes. I look forward to returning and sampling more from their menu.",1
12819,"Title: Happy Hour Haven

I recently visited this establishment for Happy Hour on a Friday night and was delighted to find that they offered half-priced drinks, providing the perfect start to the weekend. The Watermelon Margaritas were a standout, expertly mixed and refreshingly delicious.

The menu presented a challenge with its extensive range of choices, but we finally settled on the Techno Fries, Chicken Florentine Flat Bread, and a Greek Salad. The Techno Fries were a nod to classic Poutine, with a satisfying cheesy topping lathered in gravy, though a bit more gravy would have pushed it to perfection. The Chicken Florentine Flat Bread was a cheesy delight, generously adorned with melted provolone that sang in harmony with the well-seasoned chicken. The Greek Salad was a fresh balance to our meal, complete with the pleasant surprise of stuffed grape leaves.

I appreciated the cleanliness of the restaurant and the attentive service that didn’t miss a beat. The outdoor seating was a bonus, perfect for enjoying the lively atmosphere of a Friday night. I would definitely recommend this spot for those seeking a spirited Happy Hour and a varied menu that promises something for every palate.",1
1116,"Title: Mixed Feelings at Oxbow Tavern

I recently dined at Oxbow Tavern to celebrate Father's Day and, despite the promising menu, was met with a rather underwhelming experience, meriting a lukewarm 2.5 stars.

On the upside, the drink service was notably efficient. Our glasses were promptly refilled, ensuring we never went thirsty. However, the establishment’s decision not to serve bread felt like a missed opportunity, particularly because the wait for entrees left us famished.

The pricing structure was a letdown. My mom's Pan Roasted East Coast Halibut was competently prepared but failed to satisfy, especially as the accompanying potato puree was scant and seemed merely ornamental. For the price, the lack of a substantial side was disconcerting.

My dad's order of gizzards also fell short of expectations. The menu promised risotto, but only rice accompanied the dish. The waitress's candid acknowledgment of the superior former recipe implied a downgrade in quality.

My burger was overcooked and charred beyond my preference. After indulging in an upgrade, I was disappointed to find the salad option was simply dressed arugula, which isn't to my taste. Thankfully, the fries met the mark, and since my mom’s meal included no side, I passed the salad along to her.

While the service was commendable, the food itself did not live up to its price tag. Oxbow Tavern has the potential for a great dining experience, but it needs to reconsider its offerings and ensure that value corresponds with cost.",1

I recently dined at this charming establishment before catching a 7:30 show nearby and was thoroughly impressed, compelling me to give it a well-deserved five-star rating. The ambiance of the dining room was both tranquil and cozy, an ideal setting for an early dinner at 5:30 PM. The service stood out as both attentive and knowledgeable, ensuring a seamless dining experience.

The Scotch Egg was a particular highlight, paired perfectly with a well-crafted Sazerac, both of which left me eagerly anticipating my next visit. In addition, the Fish & Chips and Brined Chicken were delicious, rounding out a meal that was both comforting and satisfying. I highly recommend this restaurant for anyone seeking a delightful dining experience, especially if you have an evening event planned in the area.",1
20150,"Title: A Decent Experience at a Long-Anticipated Sushi Spot

Having eagerly awaited the chance to dine from this local sushi restaurant, I recently had the opportunity to indulge in a takeout order, an experience that was aesthetically pleasing but mixed in its culinary delivery. The highlight was undoubtedly the innovative plant-based wrapping, which added a thoughtful touch to the presentation.

The order consisted of hand rolls that were on the smaller side, which is typical for authentic offerings. Out of the five flavors, two were exceptionally tasty, while the rest lacked a memorable punch. Unfortunately, I cannot recall the specifics of the standout rolls. Alongside the sushi, I enjoyed a white peach soda, rounding up my order to a total of $41.31 – a steep price point, though somewhat justified by the quality of the ingredients.

Despite the cost, the portions left me less than satiated. While the quality of the sushi warrants the occasional splurge, the overall experience was a mixed bag. It's a place worth trying occasionally if you're in the mood for quality over quantity.",1
15363,"We popped into the restaurant for a takeout pizza for our ride home and, while we noticed the place was quite empty with staff members engrossed in their phones, the quality of the pizza did not disappoint.

1315,"Tucked away near Central Park, this cozy spot offers a delightful Nutella hot chocolate that's sure to satisfy your sweet tooth. While we didn't sample the crepes ourselves, the buzz from nearby tables was unanimously positive. A charming choice for those in the area seeking a tasty treat.",1
12578,"Title: Delightful Group Lunch Experience at Topaz

Our team recently dined at Topaz for a group lunch, and the experience was unexpectedly delightful. We were greeted with exceptional service, and despite the bustling lunch hour, our dishes arrived swiftly. Although served staggeredly, the kitchen's approach of serving plates hot off the stove ensured that every dish was enjoyed at its freshest.

I personally savored the Topaz fried rice with shrimp, which was outstanding – flavorful without being greasy, and portioned just right for lunch. Other colleagues opted for the pad see ew, which not only looked tantalizing but also received nods of approval around the table. We also indulged in an order of calamari, which was a hit thanks to its freshness and perfect seasoning.

Based on this visit, Topaz has certainly won my endorsement. It's a spot I'd confidently recommend and return to when I'm in the area.",1

12249,"Title: Joe's Pizza Lives Up to the Hype

I approached Joe's with a healthy skepticism, given my unremarkable experiences at other NYC pizza spots. However, this place turned out to be the exception. We timed our visit perfectly, beating the lunch rush at 11 am on a Saturday, and managed to quickly grab a basic cheese pizza.

Taking our prize to a nearby park bench, we dove in, and let me tell you, it was an utter delight. The sauce struck a perfect balance of sweetness, harmonizing with the right amount of cheese and a blissfully non-greasy crust. Joe's delivered an exquisite slice that made me wish for a second, yet satisfied my appetite enough to leave room for more of the city's culinary offerings.

Joe's doesn't just serve pizza; they deliver a must-have New York experience. Don't miss it.",1

The staff is amiable, providing spot-on recommendations for a tailored dining experience. To escape the summer swelter, their air conditioning is a welcome oasis, while the extensive drink menu guarantees to quench any thirst. It's an all-around hit for anyone looking for authentic flavors in a cozy, underground setting.",1

So many types of Whiskey and Bourbon they have to have what you like if you are into it.Sat in the back area at a comfy and spacious table, and then decided to go for the ""preset menu"" and get Soup, Sandwhich, and Dessert for 21 bucks. Great deal.The server was super knowledgeable, friendly and sweet.  She gave us recommendations, told us the history of the place, always came to check on us, and delivered food promptly as it came out.The Roast Beef and Dip are legit to die for.  The bread was soft, fresh, and the roast beef was tasty when dipped in Au Jus.  Also, the French Onion was perfect. I asked for lite cheese on the top, too much can be overbearing for me, and the amount they put on was great.Then it ended with Oreo Custard Cake. So rich. So delicious. Couldn't finish it all because I was stuff from the other courses.Company got some other dishes like the Buffalo Mac and Cheese, which looked HUGE and way more then a single portion. That could be two meals if you look at the picture.Incredible spot in the Upper West Side, and Hearty Food to keep you warm during the cold winter months in the city.5 stars. All class.

232,"The menu is deceiving as the Small Salad stated $3 & the employee (unfriendly) stated I could pick four toppings. That's what I did & my salad came to $9...oh, $10.50 due to the Dried Cranberry toppings. I asked the employee behind the register for clarification & for an eye rolled with a murmur of an explanation. On the flip side the small container was actually bigger than what it looked liked before the salad build, so I shifted my deception thought to being somewhat content. In addition to build own your salads, sandwiches, ready made meals including fruit, crudités, smoothies, & sweet treats are available.No need to fret, as there's too other many eateries in the concourse of Penn Station.  I'll venture around next time.",0

20165,"A group of us, a party of 4 came for Brunch around 1pm and made a reservation! RECOMMEND to make a reservation in New York City for brunch. We went to a couple of brunch restaurants yesterday and didn't have a reservation. The wait time was about 45 minutes to more than an hour wait. We ended up going to a restaurant with 3 stars and all the other places that were 4 plus stars were booked. I ordered the Korean BBQ wings with cornbread waffles, the Korean BBQ sauce on the side. My boyfriend ordered Banofee Pie French Toast. We also ordered the Crab Cake Benedict and the Braised Beef Short Rib Hash. Hands down I loved the Korean BBQ wings, the Korean BBQ sauce was amazing, I put that sauce on the side so I can first try it and dip the chicken. I finished all of the Korean BBQ Sauce with my boyfriend and it was just right for him and I. The cornbread waffle was so good and it wasn't too sweet. That dish came with Syrup as well. It hit the spot for brunch. The Braised Beef Short Rib was a delicious, great flavor. Both the crab cakes and French toast were so good. The French toast wasn't too sweet and if you wanted more sweetness just eat more caramel. Overall, I loved the ambiance and loved the honesty of the server we had.",0
14236,"Had dinner with 3 others on a Sunday. We made reservation at 5:45 pm, which was the earliest available. The place stayed pretty much empty and only two other guests arrived shortly after our meals were brought to us.There is no separate appetizers because they are included with main courses. We enjoyed baba ganoush (smoked eggplant mashed), hummus, shakshuka (tomato based), and olives with pita bread slices. Everything was presented in small dishes with exquisite patterns. For the main we shared couscous royal and lamb tagine. Couscous came with a beef broth that you should spoon some to soak the couscous. The four types of meats, including 2 sausages, lamb chop, and chicken drumstick were cooked just right. The sausages were on the salty side FYI. Lamb tagine is a flavorful lamb shank braised to tender perfection.Later we added a veggie tagine, including cauliflower florets, potatoes, carrots, artichoke, and green beans, which was seasoned mildly and nothing exciting in terms of the flavor, compared to the lamb tagine. They were likely cooked in a broth so there was no caramelization going on. I would not have ordered it on my own in the first place just judging by the ingredients. I enjoyed the window seating plus the nice interior and decor. They only serve beer and wine FYI.",0

Check in with the hostess on the first floor, who will tell you where to go. The dim sum is served traditional style with carts, and the carts all have pictures of the dishes they carry and their names in English and Chinese. This is super helpful so you know what's coming and whether you want to order some before the server comes by your table. The food itself was fresh and delicious, and I really enjoyed it.

10124,"Title: Cozy Pub Fare with a Side of Lackluster Service

I recently visited a charming Irish Pub adjacent to the Radisson, following a recommendation from the concierge. The ambiance did not disappoint, delivering a genuine dining room experience complete with bar seating and an array of televisions for a casual, engaging atmosphere.

The food was the highlight, with both my daughter and I opting for the turkey burger. It was delicious – the burger came with a generous assortment of toppings and a side of big, fresh fries that were an absolute treat. The dining area was clean and inviting, and the bar was fully stocked, boasting an extensive wine list that was sensibly priced even by New York City standards.

However, the experience was slightly marred by the service. Our waitress appeared to be somewhat inattentive and disconnected, which made us feel a bit overlooked. It was enough of a distraction to take away from the overall experience.

Despite this hiccup, the quality of the food and the pub's inviting feel are reasons enough to visit, just be prepared for service that might not match the standard set by the kitchen.",1
1189,"I had an amazing experience at this spot on a recent Saturday outing with friends. The atmosphere was incredibly inviting, and both the drinks and food offerings were reasonably priced, especially considering the location. The only downside is its popularity — the place gets packed, and since they don't accept reservations, be prepared for a bit of a wait. Despite the bustle, I would absolutely recommend giving it a try!",1
12081,"Title: Authentic Delights with a Side of Patience

My family and I are regulars at this local spot for a delicious bowl of pho. The authenticity of their Vietnamese dishes is remarkable, not to mention the wallet-friendly prices. Each visit confirms that our taste buds are in for a treat.

However, there’s a spoonful of patience required when it comes to service. While the staff is generally friendly, the pace can be leisurely, and the synchrony of dish delivery leaves room for improvement. It's not uncommon for my pho-slurping companions to polish off their bowls while I eye them enviously, waiting for my beef cubes.

Despite the service hiccups, the food quality never falters. If your priority is genuine Vietnamese cuisine that will satisfy your cravings, this is undoubtedly the place. Just be prepared for a staggered dining experience and make sure your dinner conversations are as hearty as the meal to come. Highly recommended for the food, with the hope that service will catch up to its quality.",1
3134,"I went for a bite to eat with friends after work Friday. We arrived maybe an hour after it opened in the evening. The location is small but very nicely decorated, tropical style. We ordered some cocktails and the waitress also made sure we were aware of the happy hour specials before we ordered. We ordered ""it was all a dream"" ""el mercadito"" and ""smoke in the water.""  All the drinks were very good and trust me the other ones on the menu sounded very good! To eat we ordered the Arepa heaven, which Included I believe 4/5 arepas of each arepa Style they had. Whoaaa they were small arepas de choclo with such great flavors on top. From meats to meatless they were all so good. We ordered truffle fries and the doubles. All the food is really for sharing and it was perfect. For dessert we ordered banana fosters, yummy! If you're in the LES and looking for some nice drinks and some bites. Make sure to stop by",0
14002,"I've been singing the praises of Pado to anyone who'll listen since my recent visit, and for good reason. Amidst the moderate to upscale dining options, Pado stands out as a champion of value, offering unrivaled quality and taste. For a reasonable average of $50 per person, a feast awaits: a spread of scrumptious appetizers, innovative sushi rolls, and a selection of nigiri that rivals omakase offerings.

Pro tip: Don't miss the happy hour, available until 7pm on weekdays, featuring $8 appetizers and discounted beverages. The avocado bomb is a must-try, elegantly pairing spicy tuna or salmon with velvety avocado, served alongside crunchy taro chips. The orange blossom, crispy rice with spicy tuna, and bang bang shrimp—each at $8—are all delectable choices that won't disappoint.

The sushi bar doesn't skimp on luxury; the uni from Santa Barbara is impeccably fresh, and the fatty toro nigiri is indulgence incarnate. Shareable rolls like the Hamachiba and the table-smoked Playbada roll add a playful yet refined touch to the menu.

Sweeten your experience by checking in on Yelp to receive a complimentary ice cream. The enjoyable ambience and impeccable service round out a flawless dining encounter. My only hope is that Pado remains an accessible gem, even as its deserved popularity grows.",1

The slices were perfect and not greasy and a quick serve as well.A MUST GO TO",0
1697,"Title: A Mixed Experience at a Bustling Chinatown Dim Sum Spot

Our impromptu dim sum stop in Chinatown after a New York weekend offered both delights and frustrations. We arrived just before the 11am rush and were grateful for the timing—shortly after, a throng of diners clamored for tables.

Unfortunately, the service left much to be desired. Describing the staff as the 'worst and rudest ever' seems fitting, given they insisted our party of five share a table with strangers. Thankfully, our Mandarin-speaking friend navigated this awkward situation. 

The dim sum itself? It was tasty and hit the typical marks of these traditional offerings. However, trying to order off-cart items was an exercise in patience we ultimately abandoned after being repeatedly brushed off by busy wait staff.

Payment, on the other hand, was attended to with surprising swiftness. A pity my hunger trumped my blogger instincts, and I missed snapping photos of our dishes. In sum, the experience was a bittersweet symphony of culinary highs and service lows.",1
15141,"I recently dined at this gem of a restaurant and was blown away by the experience. The ""Tres Amigos"" dish, a delectable combination of salmon, tuna, hamachi, spicy tuna, and yaki salmon, was nothing short of exquisite. With generous portions and harmonious flavors, it provided a hearty and satisfying meal. This restaurant is a must-visit, and I'm already looking forward to my next visit.",1
1040,"Discovering Sido's felt like stumbling upon a hidden treasure in my own neighborhood. I popped in for dinner and opted for the lamb shawarma plate, which was accompanied by a pleasing array of rice, veggies, hummus, and pita. While I awaited my meal, I was treated to a sample falafel by the courteous staff—an explosion of perfectly blended spices in a single bite that instantly won me over.

When my main dish arrived, it was a generous serving that I mistakenly thought I couldn't finish—only to find my plate empty soon after. The taste of the falafel lingered in my mind, enticing me to order three more. Sido's swift service and the warm demeanor of their staff are worth noting. I'm confident I've found my new go-to spot for a delightful meal. Sido's has left a lasting impression and assured my return.",1
19078,"For people who don't know their pizza, they'd say Joe's pizza is average or that it just tastes like 99 cents pizza. I'd admit, they're similar because they are both pizza after all. But, Joe's pizza is $3 worthy whereas dollar pizza is $1 worthy. There's a $2 difference between the pizzas and Joe's pizza is definitely tastier. I'd say the worth is similar, but Joe's pizza is obviously better: pizza is always fresh, sauce is perfectly sweet, cheese is melty, and crust is thin but chewy.For those who want to eat the NY slice, go for the 99 cents pizza if you don't want to spend a lot. Joe's pizza is an experience, it's good but one slice won't fill you up so the price adds up. I'd definitely go at least once for Joe's pizza if you're visiting from elsewhere.",0
17454,"This was my first time having chicken ramen (spicy paitan) and I am still firmly in the pork camp, but I was really surprised at how much depth and body the chicken base had. While it was delicious, I think it's odd that what most places include free of charge Totto does not. You have to pay extra for an egg- outrageous! I also paid for kikurage mushrooms and fried garlic. Their appetizers are really strong, I would not skip them. The fried chicken was sooooo juicy and tender. They also had a raw tuna appetizer over rice that was delicious and extremely generous for the price. Another winner was the yuzu soju cocktail. They put a lime wedge in it, so its citrus on citrus, very refreshing! Service was sweet, and we weren't rushed out. I would come back...but would probably still get the pork ;)",0

It's a snug place that offers an array of meats and delectable lunch sandwiches. I decided to try their top seller, which didn't disappoint; the fig, mozzarella, arugula, and prosciutto nestled within a fresh baguette were in harmonious proportion. Limited but charming window seating is available, complementing the experience with a variety of Italian beverages to enjoy alongside your meal. A delightful find indeed!",1
10964,"Title: A Morning Delight for Eggheads!

My latest visit to this gem of a breakfast spot only reaffirms why I'm a regular. Absolutely amazing food! I indulged in ""The Basic,"" ""The Classic,"" and the ""Steak and Cheese,"" each dish prepared to perfection and bursting with freshness since it's made-to-order. The prices won't break the bank, and there's something quite satisfying about watching your meal come together right before your eyes.

But it's not just the food that makes this place special - it's the people. The staff is the epitome of friendliness. Their warm welcomes and the fact that they remember our usual orders add a personalized touch that turns a simple meal into an experience. My love for this place is undeniable; I'm an egghead through and through. If you're looking for a spot that nails breakfast every time, look no further!",1
14351,"It was a quaint restaurant in the beautiful neighborhood that was bustling with style. The restaurant space was small but it made use of what it has very effectively with tables to seat a crowd of people very intimately. It's cramped without forcing an invasion of privacy. Honestly it makes you feel like one big family that is having a fairly priced slice of togetherness. The flavors of my slice of pie were fresh and bold and a bit greasy. It's not the kind of greasy that makes you regret coating your mouth with 5 pounds. It's th type of great that carries all the flavorful bits. Haha the cheese was excellent.  It may not have been the most attractive slice, but the quality was superb.",0
2623,Popped in for lunch while showing someone around from out of town. Great place for a quick bite that is reasonably priced. We ordered grape leaves and shawarma sandwiches on the homemade lavash. The grape leaves tasted canned but good nonetheless. The shawarma sandwiches were perfect!,0

10091,"Title: A Hearty Bite to Beat the New York Chill

On a particularly brisk New York day, the discovery of a charming little diner near the World Trade Center was a welcome respite. The efficiency of service shone through as we were promptly seated and handed an extensive menu that tested our decision-making skills.

I indulged in the bacon cheeseburger platter, a monstrous assembly of meat, cheese, steak fries, and coleslaw. It was reminiscent of an ideal backyard BBQ burger - juicy, substantial, and downright delicious. Meanwhile, my husband savored his matzah ball soup; the matzah was impressively large, the broth was rich in flavor, though the noodles proved a bit tricky to manage. His pizza burger was equally as enormous and lavishly topped with marinara and cheese.

The service was commendable, punctuating our meal with attentiveness and efficiency. The bonus of delivery service (though I'm uncertain of the reach) is a thoughtful touch.

If you're in the area and hunger strikes, this diner promises to satisfy with its generous portions and flavorful fare. You'll leave braced against the chill and full to the brim. Enjoy the feast!",1
18187,"Title: A Taste of Unique Flavors Delivered to Your Door

During these times of limited dining options, I've turned to delivery to satisfy my culinary wanderlust, and my latest gastronomic journey led me to an intriguing spot that appears to be rooted in the rich culinary traditions of Senegal.

The fataya, reminiscent of a deep-fried empanada, came stuffed with beef, encased in a golden crust, and accompanied by a smoky sauce that tantalized the taste buds with its spicy kick. It was a delightful start.

Then came the nem, similar to beef-filled spring rolls, paired with a tangy sauce that was unlike anything I've previously encountered. Its uniqueness was refreshingly delightful.

I also opted for the chawarma, a variation of shawarma enveloped in a wrap with lamb and fries. While it was a valiant attempt at this classic, the lamb was a bit overdone for my liking, leaving a touch of toughness that diverged from what I am accustomed to in Greek shawarma.

The domada yapp presented a rich tomato sauce with lamb and vegetables, which was robust and spicy. However, as someone who prefers their meat off the bone, the lamb's presentation was not to my personal preference – something to consider when selecting dishes.

One useful tip for future patrons: peruse the menu carefully since some dishes are available only on specific days.

Overall, the broad menu of this establishment provides a palate-expanding experience with authentic flavors that are well worth exploring again.",1
18204,"I went to this place for a brunch. Bicol Benedict was really good and flavorful. It is an egg Benedict. On top of bread (or bun) there is a piece of bicol express (pork shoulder) and then topped with poached egg. That was a nice twist to Benedict. Bicol was flavorful. Home fries which comes with it is sweet potato fries, which is really good. Chori burger had excellent flavors too. It tasted better with sunny side up. Spicy banana ketchup was yummy. Previously I had food from Maharlika, their brother restaurant. That bill had a coupon for free cocktail from Jeepney. I went with Sabang beach cool. It was a nice drink.",0
20699,"Hatsuhana--my favorite, favorite sushi spot in NYC. Right when you step inside, you'll feel like you're in Japan. Made reservations (which is highly recommended) on Yelp and our party of 4 were seated immediately. After being seated, they give you hot towels to clean your hands before eating which is always neat. I come here at least twice a month for their Box of Dreams which is their popular signature entree ($48). I wish I can come more often since I crave sushi quite often--I mean very often, but it isn't cheap. That's because they use top quality ingredients and the food presentation is always excellent. My other three buddies ordered box of dreams, avocado lovers maki ($22), and sushi dinner ($28). We all had a great time and enjoyed our respective dishes. Service is always excellent. We weren't being rushed which is pleasant especially in NYC. Our waiter checked up on us throughout our meal and our hot green teas were always being refilled. I'll be back--in 2 weeks!",0
10673,"I recently visited a local eatery with a friend for a small lunch, opting for their Jian bing, order #3, with an added BBQ chicken topping for an extra charge. Our bill came to just over $10, which felt a bit steep for the single item shared between us. Taste-wise, it was satisfactory albeit on the salty side, reminiscent of typical food court fare. Patrons should note that the dish is served with only chopsticks, which might not be the best utensil for the Jian bing's texture. I'd recommend requesting a knife for convenience, unless you're comfortable eating with your hands.",1
11601,"Title: A Satisfying Customizable GF Burger at brgr in Chelsea

During a hunt for a quick burger fix, I stumbled upon brg in Chelsea and couldn't resist trying their touted gluten-free options. Prices are reasonable, with basic burgers starting around $10 and plenty of customizations available. My choice was a beefy delight - a single patty burger with succulent bacon, earthy mushrooms, a double helping of tangy pickles, crisp lettuce, all slathered in a signature brgr sauce.

True, the burger was on the greasy side, dripping enough to necessitate a basket beneath, something I'd prefer less of, but the flavor payoff was worth it. It's worth noting the beef is 100% grass-fed, a quality touch. Gluten-free diners will appreciate the bun option for an extra $1.50, or the no-charge romaine lettuce ""bed"" for a lighter touch.

Despite the grease, the burger was undeniably filling and satisfying. brgr has nailed the quick, customizable burger experience for the gluten-conscious crowd. I'd definitely go back for another round.",1
18930,"Title: A Taste of Authenticity at Laut - Worth the Buzz

As an avid follower of the Buzzfeed series ""Worth It,"" and sharing a similar heritage to co-host Steven Lim, my expectations for Laut were high in search of authentic Singaporean/Malaysian flavors. The experience did not disappoint.

Sipping on the Teh Tarik and Kopi transported me back to my mother's kitchen and to the streets of Singapore—both beverages mastered to perfection. The Roti Canai was a delightful starter, with its flaky layers and rich, savory chicken curry dip perfectly encapsulating the fusion of Chinese, Indian, and Malaysian influences.

The main event, Curry Laksa, lived up to its ""Worth It"" feature. True to form with its complex, spicy broth and fresh seafood, it was a comforting reminder of home, though slightly saltier than traditional recipes—a possible nod to Western tastes. The Chili Soft Shell Crab with Steamed Bao, while saucier than its Singaporean counterpart, was an enjoyable seasonal offering, though it left me yearning for rice as its companion.

Thankfully, the accompanying plate of fragrant coconut rice was exemplary in its simplicity and flavor, demonstrating that sometimes the simplest dishes resonate the most.

Laut stands as a beacon of authenticity and culinary delight. Despite a minor hiccup with the salt level, the restaurant earns its ""worth it"" title, presenting a genuine taste of Singapore and Malaysia without the need for a boarding pass.",1
20037,"Title: A Pleasant Surprise at Makana - A Melting Pot of Flavors

My sister and I stumbled upon Makana during a casual stroll, and despite my initial hesitation due to its unconventional mix of BBQ, Poke, and Tacos on the signage, we decided to give it a go. The restaurant itself is quaint, but what it lacks in size, it compensates with the warmth of its staff.

We dove straight into the menu, my sister opting for the Hamachi Poki Bowl, while I ventured for the Ocean. Both dishes impressed us with their freshness and flavor. A shared order of fish tacos exceeded expectations, striking the right balance between zest and texture.

On our way out, we couldn't resist grabbing coconut shrimp to go, a treat we intended for our mother which, undoubtedly, concluded our meal on a high note.

Makana proved to be a delightful find in the neighborhood, and it's safe to say we're already looking forward to our next visit.",1
14499,"I recently visited an Asian-inspired restaurant that truly impressed me with its bowl-based offerings and creative shareables. The space was vibrant, perfectly complementing the meal's energy. The service stood out, with attentive staff and a delightful complimentary green tea that set a welcoming tone.

15555,"Title: A Pleasant Ramen Experience with Room for Service Improvement

I recently visited a new ramen shop on a quiet Wednesday around 1 PM. The ambiance struck me immediately: a cozy setup with an open kitchen adjacent to the bar seating. Opting for the dining area to dodge the kitchen aromas, I found the service could use some refinement – it was rather unorganized and on the slower side.

While the drinks took their time arriving (my Sapporo draft had lost much of its foam, indicating it had been sitting a while), the food itself was a different story. The presentation caught my eye, and the taste lived up to the visuals. We had three different ramens complemented by three sides. The chashu was particularly noteworthy – tender, juicy, and not drenched in sauce.

A minor hiccup occurred when I requested Sichimi (red pepper), which took some time and was presented in a small sauce dish rather than the traditional bottle – an unusual choice for a ramen establishment.

Overall, the place is worth a visit for the food alone, especially if you’re not pressed for time. With some tweaks to service efficiency, this could easily become a go-to spot for ramen enthusiasts.",1
2925,"I recently visited a local restaurant that truly impressed me with its reasonable pricing and spacious ambiance, making it an excellent spot for gatherings with friends. The beer selection was commendable, mirroring the variety one would expect at a proper beer garden. While the establishment was conducive to socializing, I felt that additional TVs for sports viewing would enhance the experience, as many patrons frequent beer gardens for this purpose. The staff was amiable and the clientele seemed to skew towards a younger crowd, predominantly in their early 20s. Overall, a great place that I'd recommend to those looking to enjoy a laid-back evening with good beer and company.",1
15798,"Got the boxes of dream because it looks cute and yummy. But looks can be deceiving and this is the case. Nothing tastes amazing, just mediocre. For $48 I guess price is reasonable for tasting different kind of sashimi. Note that they put sushi rice underneath so it can be filling.",0
20639,"Title: A Sizzling Affair at Mala Project

I've found myself utterly smitten by Mala Project – so much so that I'm already craving a repeat visit after dining there just this past Tuesday. This gem dishes out an unforgettable hot pot stir-fry experience, bursting with a variety of veggies and customizable options to satisfy any palate. Opting for takeout, I savored my meal in the tranquil park across the street, although the option to dine at their cozy bar is available for solo visitors.

The restaurant's interior is modestly sized with seating for about 30 and boasts a modern Asian aesthetic that's both dimly lit and inviting. The standout for me was the ""Tripe Please"" stir-fry – a playful twist on their ""Beef Please"" – which was not just palatable but spectacular, especially when accompanied by a side of rice. The mild spice hit the perfect note, offering a pleasurable heat without the aftermath of heartburn. The dish was a symphony of textures and taste: crunchy lotus roots, tender broccoli, and silky tofu skin, alongside perfectly chewy, layered tripe, all mingled amidst a sea of piquant peppers, fragrant garlic, and deep umami.

At $15, the lunch portion is priced fairly, representing a modest indulgence that reflects the high-quality fare. My order was ready in a brisk ten minutes – a testament to their efficient service. For anyone seeking a flavorful journey with just the right kick, Mala Project is a spot that shouldn't be missed.",1

2422,"This place was really good. The hours are a bit limited and the space is small. There was someone that came in with more people than she had reserved a table for and she got admonished for it, which was kind of funny. Made it seem like you were visiting a relative for dinner. We got the lasagna and the homemade shrimp pasta. Both were great. The lasagna was a bit oily, but very flavorful. The shrimp pasta was probably my favorite of the two. I would definitely come back here.",0

10947,"Title: A Memorable Feast at Per Se

After years of elusive availability, I finally snagged a rare 1pm reservation at Per Se through Tock—though not without a bit of struggle due to technical issues. A $100 per person deposit is steep but sets the tone for the exclusivity of the experience.

Opting for the Salon tasting menu, we were greeted with an abundance of culinary delights. Despite our best efforts, the generous portions meant we had to take some of our meal home. Highlights included the buttery Wagyu beef, the earthy black truffle pasta, the delicate Montauk skate fish, the sumptuous Maine lobster capellini, and the signature Oysters and Pearls.

Each course was a testament to Per Se's commitment to exceptional presentation, flawless service, and extraordinary flavors. It's a tight race, but Per Se, alongside Le Bernardin, now reigns as one of my top dining experiences in New York.

The finale included takeaway treats—homemade biscuits and sublime chocolates that left me convinced Per Se could run a successful confectionary side hustle. In short, Per Se knocked it out of the park, cementing its status as a must-visit culinary destination.",1
11645,"Reluctantly, I'm sharing my new favorite date spot – though part of me wishes to keep it secret to avoid the inevitable crowds that will flock once word gets out. Nestled in an idyllic location, this restaurant is a gem when it comes to enjoying the balmy weather outdoors amidst stunning surroundings.

The staff exude hospitality, treating you with utmost politeness and genuine sweetness. More astonishing is the affordability of such exquisite Italian cuisine – quality dining without the fear of a hefty bill. I'm already planning my return visit; it's a treat too delightful to not repeat.

The menu is a parade of Italian classics, with the Tuscan meatballs stealing the limelight. Bursting with herbs and robust flavors, they're simply unforgettable. The lasagna follows closely, its rich layers are a testament to decadence, while the salad is a refreshing preamble to the indulgent courses that follow.

I've been singing praises about this place for a week straight – no exaggeration. Its blend of beauty, flavor, and value is wonderful indeed.",1

During my visit, the Chicken Salad sandwich truly stood out, striking a perfect balance of flavors and textures. The anticipation is high for the next tasting, which will include the Katsu, Potato Salad, and the variety of kimbap on offer. And don't miss the rice & beans – surprisingly great and worth grabbing before you leave. David Chang's latest venture is a clear hit, offering something delicious for everyone.",1

I have so much confidence in this restaurant because my thought is, whenever there are Chinese people lining up at a Chinese restaurant, it must be really good! I ordered the Fish Balls Noodles and added Pig Intestines. The fish balls are the kind that I like, with pork inside. The Noodles were chewy and the soup was flavorful!! I really enjoyed my bowl of noodles!!The only down side is that depending on where you sit, it could be quite dark. The staff actually also delivered a wrong order to us, but they reacted quickly and resolved the problem while apologizing, so it wasn't a big deal to me.",0

For the skewer, I got barg kabob (steak) and my sister got chicken kabob. The Chicken Kabob platter was ~$11 and the Barg Kabob platter was ~$13. I went with their seasoned rice (mixed with carrots and raisins), Greek salad, roasted carrots, and broccoli. My sister got Greek salad, roasted potatoes, and roasted carrots. For dips, I went with hummus, baba ganoush, and Persian eggplant. My sister got hummus, spinach yogurt, and cucumber yogurt. I also got some mini pickles and fresh Persian bread on the side.Everything was absolutely delicious! I particularly liked the rice, seasoned meats, and various dips. The vegetables were all super fresh. The dips went so well with everything, especially the bread. I wish I had more of that bread.

2040,"Title: Quick Lunch Option with Room for Improvement

I popped into this spot for a quick bite and was pleased to discover they offer individual pizza slices. They present a variety of lunch specials—slices paired with salad at different price points. I opted for a $7 deal which got me a single slice and a small house salad, complete with a tiny bottle of water. While economical, the portion was modest; the slice was quite small, making this a poor choice for the ravenous. Their thin-crust style meant no post-meal bloat, but the pizza itself was somewhat oily and, although tasty, didn't leave a lasting impression.

The ambiance was calm and quiet, perfect for enjoying a meal solo in the window seat. The space also accommodates larger groups with a separate dining area. Overall, it's a solid option for those in the area, but not a pizza I'd travel across town for.",1
13075,"Title: Breathtaking Views Overshadow Culinary Experience

My visit to this NYC gem offered an unforgettable panorama that is sure to impress any guest. The vantage point presents a unique look at the Statue of Liberty, making it an ideal destination for a memorable brunch. Despite its potential for tourist attraction, it remains an insider's secret.

The establishment boasts a prix fixe menu priced at $78, offering a selection of dishes. Our appetizers included the Oyster Rockefeller and the White Asparagus, followed by Striped Bass and Monkfish as mains. While pleasant, the flavors of the food were not as memorable as the surrounding scenery, which seemed to enhance the overall dining experience.

An intriguing feature of the venue is its open kitchen, allowing diners a peek into the culinary action. It's worth noting that the restaurant adopts a no-tipping policy - a refreshing nod to modern dining practices.

For those considering a visit, a window seat comes highly recommended to fully embrace the view. However, if I were to return, I'd opt for a casual drink at the bar to savor the ambiance. While the cuisine might not live up to the high standards set by the location, this spot is worth checking out for its spectacular setting.",1

15958,"Title: A Missed Culinary Adventure at an Indian Fusion Restaurant

My anticipation for a unique dining experience was high upon entering this aesthetically appealing establishment, complemented by attentive service. However, that is where the praise ends, as the culinary journey was fraught with disappointments.

The concept of ramen on an Indian menu intrigued us, but it turned out to be an unsatisfying venture – an $18 bowl of soggy noodles with a scant three bites, immersed in a coconut-flavored broth that missed the mark, and a lone piece of paneer that left us wanting.

The sides – chutneys, kolcha, and garlic naan – were serviceable but unremarkable, hardly justifying their price. The butter chicken stood out as the menu's redemption, requiring an additional purchase of basmati rice to complete the dish. Similarly, the ribs offered a pleasant surprise with their pulled pork-like texture and robust flavor.

In summary, this restaurant charges a premium for average fare, with a few hits but too many misses. The food here struggles to live up to both its promise and price point.",1

271,"During Restaurant Week, we visited this establishment and took advantage of their two-course offering for $29, which included prime dry-aged steaks. The value was exceptional given the quality of dry-aged meat. Our dining experience was enhanced by the pleasantly good steaks and the warm, friendly service.",1
10142,"This place is located in a lovely place in Greenwich Village. I was looking for a vegetarian-friendly place in Greenwich and their reviews led me here. I must say I was a tad disappointed as my whole experience was not so great unlike all the other reviews here. We visited the place during a Friday lunchtime. We had called to check if we needed a reservation but whoever picked our call said it was not necessary. We reached the place around 2 PM and had to wait for almost 10 minutes to get seated. As it was just my husband, me and my baby, we got a tiny table on the corner. Throughout my lunch span there the place was super busy and I saw a lot of people waiting outside for more than 20 minutes to get seated. That means the place is crowded at 3-3:30 PM on a weekday and it surely shows that it's the favorite of many people there.We got a free iced tea which came with yelp check-in. We could barely get the attention of the servers while we placed the order as they were running on their toes and had not much time in answering our questions. We ordered pineapple vegetable fried rice, spring rolls chicken basil fried rice, chicken satay and a bubble tea. Well, everything was just average and we did not find anything great. Pineapple fried rice was the most disappointing dish as the rice was not cooked properly and lacked any flavor.  Perhaps they were so busy they did not get time to cook food properly or whatever, I don't see myself back here.",0
16117,"TLDR: Excellent Italian eatery in TriBeCa. Grab a bottle or glass of wine. Tagliolini al Tartufo e Speck or Neri ai Frutti di Mare. You'll be set.Delicious Italian eatery in TriBeCa near Canal. Da Mikele is part of the Luzzo restaurant group which has several locations in the city.This has been one of our favs for pasta in the city. The dishes are around $18 to $20 and they're a good size. You won't be left feeling hungry or like you need to go to sleep.The Tagliolini al Tartufo e Speck or Taliolini Neri ai Frutti di Mare are what I'd recommend. The first one is a rich dish but it's just so wonderful. The pasta is just covered in this luxurious creamy emulsion of truffle and the bits of smoked prosciutto just highlight everything. The Frutti di Mare has a nice hint of spice and a generous serving of seafood.The meat and cheese board is great but if it's just you or another - get the small. The large while not much more expensive, will be way too much to finish. Wines are around $40 a bottle.Their pizzas are good too. Da Mikele is a solid Italian choice if you're in the area or are looking to add another good restaurant to your list.",0
1574,"A friend from Hong Kong recommended this place for lunch (as well as one who saw this on Instagram), and I am soooo glad I finally went. This is now one of my go to restaurants in the area. I came on a Sunday for lunch and surprisingly the restaurant was pretty empty, so our party of 7 didn't have to wait for a table! You order at the counter and then bring your number to your seat and they deliver it to you. I love that there are videos showing you how to cook your food too. I ordered the classic pepper rice, which seems simple (rice, corn, beef), but it was SO TASTY. Especially with the sweet garlic sauce! I got my order pretty quickly, and you do have to be careful since the plate is 500°F (260°C), but there's a piece of paper around the plate that will remind you not to touch it. Using the spoon to mix and cook the beef was actually pretty fun. The sizzling/steam is neat (I'm a sucker for meals where you get to cook your food). You'll have everything you need at your table too (tongs, spoons, forks, knives, garlic soy sauce, sweet garlic sauce, wasabi, garlic). I would definitely come back!",0
15674,"I recently visited this spot with high hopes for a decadent milkshake, specifically the chocolate peanut butter variety. The staff were the highlight with their friendliness and made the ordering process a breeze. However, my anticipation deflated upon tasting the $8.99 concoction (including the extra charge for peanut butter). Financial indulgence occasionally is fine by me, but the milkshake didn't deliver value for money. The peanut butter, although rich, was unevenly distributed, settling in clumps at the bottom rather than blended throughout. Furthermore, the chocolate's flavor was reminiscent of sugar-free substitutes, which didn't align with my palate. In short, I would pass on a repeat performance and might opt for a simple Wendy's Frosty next time.",1

I think the quick service, portion size, and price were great, especially for Manhattan. I ordered the Pad Kee Mau, which tasted good - I think it could've been spicier but I do love spicy food.Overall, if you're in the area and craving some Thai food, this is a good option.",0

19741,"Recently, I had the pleasure of dining at the newly opened The Jones, which has taken the mantle from its predecessor, The Great Jones. Spearheaded by Gabe Stulman, the establishment currently serves breakfast and lunch, and I must report that the offerings are nothing short of incredible.

During my visit, I indulged in the Filet O Fish, priced at a reasonable $17, and the Spaghetti, which set me back $20. Both dishes were exemplary and earn a hearty recommendation from me.

I also caught a glimpse of some enticing breakfast options being prepared, which only solidified my decision to return soon. The Jones is certainly off to a stellar start, and I’m already looking forward to my next meal there.",1
3141,"Title: A Taro Revelation at The Puff Spot

Walking into The Puff Spot, I was on a mission - to taste the taro puff that captivated me in a Yelp photo, looking like an indulgent Taro sandwich. As someone who had never experienced a taro puff before, my expectations were purely based on visuals, yet the reality surpassed them entirely.

The first bite was a revelation. The sweetness of the taro was masterfully balanced - subtle, yet distinct, a perfect counterpart to the creaminess of the filling that, frankly, was off the charts. This heavenly mixture was encased in a fresh, fluffy crust that complemented each mouthful with its delicate texture. It's rare to taste something so unique and instantly fall in love, but here we are.

While I was there, I couldn't resist trying the sesame ball. Yes, it's greasy, but in the most satisfying way, and utterly delicious. If you have to choose one, though, make it the taro puff. It's a game-changer.

End your meal on a high note with this delight and then, do as I say: get that taro puff and message me after. It's a five-star masterpiece that deserves the accolades. (Swoon indeed!)",1
2968,"Title: A Welcome Addition to Hell's Kitchen – Westville HK Shines

I've long been a patron of Westville's various locations across the city, so you can imagine my delight upon discovering their new outpost in Hell's Kitchen. Despite anticipating a standard long wait this past Friday night, we were seated promptly within a mere 5-10 minutes.

Service at Westville HK was nothing short of superb, setting the stage for what was to be a stellar dining experience. To kick things off, we indulged in two of my personal favorites: the crisply tender Bok Choy and the indulgent smoky Mac n' Cheese, elevated with succulent bits of bacon.

Venturing from the reliable standard menu, we tried the nightly specials, the blackened mahi mahi with avocado salsa on a bed of sautéed spinach, and the zesty chili lime rice bowl with perfectly cooked skirt steak. As always, the market vegetables—a signature Westville offering—complemented the entrées flawlessly.

Westville's versatility remained its strong suit; it's a rare gem where cravings ranging from a juicy burger to a light yet satisfying keto-friendly plate are equally gratified with appetizing options.

In conclusion, Westville HK has secured its spot as my go-to local haunt, ensuring that no matter the dietary whim, a delectable solution is just around the corner. Welcome to the neighborhood, Westville!",1
10633,"My recent dining experience at this restaurant was mostly positive. Although the music volume was higher than I prefer, creating a less than ideal atmosphere, and the allowance of indoor smoking was a bit off-putting, the culinary offerings more than made up for these drawbacks.

The cocktail menu impressed us with its variety and quality. The food truly shone, boasting both excellence in taste and reasonable pricing. The grilled cheese, a seemingly simple dish, was executed to perfection, prompting us to order extra chips, which were delightful. My husband found the sliders to be equally enjoyable, satisfying his appetite with their juicy flavors.

A standout dish was the crispy rice with spicy tuna—a dish that was nothing short of amazing, tantalizing our taste buds with its perfect blend of texture and spice.

Despite the minor inconveniences, the quality of the food and drinks ensures that we will definitely be returning for another meal.",1
11195,"I like most of what this place has to offer and the concept of it. I feel like the açaí bowls and smoothie bowls could be prettier. Considering the blue mermaid is more expensive than the other bowls, I would expect it to look nicer and have more toppings. The bowl really didn't have any noteworthy ingredients in the bowl or on top of the bowl other than the E3Live blue majik. I know blue majik is heavily regarded as a new and trendy superfood, and I know how much it costs, so even if it comes out to $1/serving for the algae, the entire bowl is $14, and should have a little more something in there than pineapple and coconut cream.... I mean it's fine that it's a themed item, but not really a nutritious one. The toppings of mulberries is horrible considering how sweet mulberries are and to put so many on there, there's nothing to really balance it out. A mermaid can have more colors to the color scheme as well and doesn't have to be limited to mulberries and coconut, it can have green and gold as well. Considering the base is only coconut and pineapple, topping it with more coconut doesn't give much diversity to this bowl. I think the pitaya or protein bowls might be a better bet for the smoothie bowls.Blue mermaid was definitely not instaworthy, which was a huge disappointment since I had been craving it and this was one of very few places in NY I saw that had it.If it wasn't for wanting blue majik on New Years, I probably wouldn't bother with coming here and getting my blue mermaid bowl. It didn't turn out to be tasty or pretty, just pricey. As for the warm bowls, I loved everything on top of the sushi bowl, but the rice was just...not cooked well. It was like mushy and hard. I think it the rice had a softer, stickier texture it would mesh better with the flavors and texture or the bowl.Not a fan of the attitude I got from the lady at the cashier. But I'll keep this review about the food.",0
17044,"I really enjoyed my meal that I ordered for delivery. We got the burrata, which was a large portion and tasted good, but wasn't the best I've ever had. The arugula salad with goat cheese and pine nuts was just ok, but my husband loved it. The margarita pizza was very good. Very thin crust and brick oven. The spinach and ricotta ravioli were amazing. The pasta was fresh and the vodka sauce it came in was amazing! I would get the pizza and ravioli again but not the other app. I just recently came here again and tried more things from the menu. The meatballs & broccoli rabe was amazing and the chicken parm was good. However, I probably wouldn't get the rice balls again. They were a little spicy and didn't have much flavor. I also didn't love the gnocchi. They were a little too dense, but the sauce was good. We also tried the special pizza (mozzarella, asparagus, Brie and soppressata). This was ok, but a bit too oily. Overall, I would come back.",0

12886,"Title: A Slice of Manhattan Charm: La Margarita Pizzeria

I recently revisited a slice of nostalgia at La Margarita in Manhattan and encountered a familiar face - the owner himself! Warmly greeted on the sidewalk by the same gentleman who remembered me from his Bronx venue, it's intriguing how some people make a lasting impression. This encounter alone paved the way for an enjoyable experience.

La Margarita didn't disappoint with their pizza, which was, as always, top-notch. It's a gratifying meal that makes local competitor Champion's offerings taste lackluster in comparison. With prices reflecting the expensive Manhattan landscape, I still find the quality and service worth every penny, justifying its 5-star merit without hesitation.

Adding to the surprise, the owner also acquired Stanton pizza nearby, a favorite haunt of mine. The pizzas at both locations now share a delicious similarity – talk about a monopoly on good taste!

Though it wasn’t my top pick for slices, the flavorful pizza coupled with an admirable owner who recognizes and values his customers, easily makes La Margarita a standout establishment. It truly embodies Lou Bega’s playful vibes of 'Slice Number Five,' as each mouthful brings a zest of Mozzarella, Parmesan, and the quintessential Margarita essence that keeps you coming back for more. 

La Margarita gets a solid 5-star rating from me, for its commitment to quality, commendable service, and for making a simple pizza outing pleasantly memorable.",1
18709,"Finally tried this noodle spot out! Came on a Sunday around noon and got seated right away. Beautiful interior and staff was the friendliestThe menu was limited I guess since it was brunch. I wasn't sure if I wanted a noodle broth, but the staff recommended the JeJu Bibim Myun was more unique. From the top, it's a colorful presentation and reminds me of bibimbap. The real beauty is once you mix everything together with the noodles beneath and you get this really savory paste all over the noods, very meaty with a kick to it. Definitely would have it again.",0
18967,"I went to Chirp for lunch and got the Chirp Chicken Sandwich, which had chicken, plantains, lettuce, tomato, and honey mustard in it. It was okay. The chicken was pretty ordinary even though it is Chirp's specialty. Notice that I used the singular ""tomato"" in my previous description. That's because there was only a singular tomato slice in my sandwich. The bread was hard and burned around the edges. The plantains really saved the sandwich, as they added a nice sweet taste and soft texture.The service speed is fine. There is limited seating in the small restaurant. The decor has some nice little details like writing on a post in the middle of the restaurant and small plants on each table.Overall, Chirp is a fine place to go if you're just looking for a cheap and quick place for lunch. It's okay, but don't expect too much from this little place. I'm giving it 3 chirps out of 5.",0
20168,"After walking past 6 different restaurants in Inwood, as none of them seemed appealing, we took a chance on The Park View and were not disappointed! Heads up this place is cash only! The inside of the restaurant is dimly lit and had decent air conditioning, which was great considering yesterday was one of the hottest days of the month.We arrived as a group of four. Two members of our group ordered a glass of Rose, another just a Diet Coke, and I had a bottle of hard ginger beer. I've only had regular ginger beer before, but I really liked the alcoholic ginger beer, the alcohol didn't take away from the spice of the ginger, and was very refreshing. I had a sip of one of my friends glasses of rose and it was very delicious. I am unsure as to which brand of rose they serve, but as someone who doesn't normally like Rose wine, I found this one to be delightful. We ordered chips and guacamole to share for the table. Their guacamole is very chunky, with chunks of tomato in it as well. For my entree, I had the grilled chicken sandwich that came with a side of fries. It might have been the best chicken I ever had. The sandwich was grilled chicken with sun-dried tomatoes, sliced mozzarella, pesto mayo, on an olive bread. The flavors complemented each other beautifully and everything tasted very fresh. My friends who each ordered something different had said that their meals were good too! I also appreciate that when I asked for a different dipping sauce other than ketchup, our waiter gladly brought me a small dish of ranch. The ranch was very good, it must of been homemade, because it did not taste like a grocery store brand and wasn't thick and chunky like other ranch dressings I've had before. If I am in Inwood again, I will definitely have dinner at The Park View. I am very pleased with the service and the quality of their food and beverages!",0
10331,This was a last minute stop as we parked our truck in the lot across the street . One thing to say is they're guacamole was awesome as an appy and for the main I had the fish tacos  which were great. 4 mini tacos with rice and beans in a little cast iron skillet. Totally enjoyed them. Wife had a chicken  Torta which was juicy and tasty and by the looks of it. Was enjoyed by her. Prices weren't as at all and would love to come back when we are in the city again.,0
18336,"Title: A Letdown at The Edition: When Service Falls Short

My husband and I, seasoned food enthusiasts and active reviewers, had high hopes for our on-site dining experience at The Edition hotel by Marriott during our much-awaited tour of the Northeast. Unfortunately, our expectations were not only unmet but profoundly disappointed at the hotel's restaurant.

The setting initially impressed us with its garden-like ambiance and a sense of luxury, but our initial enchantment quickly dwindled as we experienced neglect from the service staff. Despite the restaurant being far from busy, we found ourselves abandoned for twenty minutes, devoid of the basic courtesy of water or the anticipated morning coffee. Our patience worn thin, we left without a single staff member inquiring about our premature departure.

Aggravated yet determined not to let this spoil our NYC adventure, we found solace in the city's abundant brunch offerings elsewhere. It's worth noting that, despite our complaints at checkout, the indifference persisted until we firmly insisted, resulting in a reluctant waiving of a misconstrued 'destination fee'.

To fellow travelers, I advise inquiring about the specifics of hotel credits upon arrival to avoid similar issues. As for the dining at The Edition, I regretfully give it the lowest possible rating, for even the loveliest setting cannot compensate for a lack of basic customer service.",1

We noticed this place as we were walking to go find something else and figured it would be good. We got steamed veggie dumplings as an appetizer which were very good, and he got the bean curd (which he had never tried before) and loved it. I got chicken with broccoli and it was very tasty. The food wasn't swimming in sauce which I also liked and the broccoli still had a nice crunch to it. The service was great and the fruit they gave us at the end of our meal was delicious! Great stop, glad we found it!",0

The cookie sandwich placed on the rim of the cup was simply delectable and probably the first thing that was attacked on this drink.",0

I was attending a comedy show at Canal Street Market and brought food there but needed a something to wash it down. I saw several people drinking what looked like an over sized version of a capri sun which I just knew I had to try.They had three different flavor options and I decided to go with the mango choice which ran about three dollars and some change. Overall an extremely fresh and tasty drink. However, I feel like if they expanded on their flavor options they'd definitely garner more customers. My friend wanted to buy one but she disliked the small variety of options they had.The staff was friendly but they weren't able to take cash so both my friend and I had to use our cards which weren't our initial preference.",0

In fact, they should have a whole ceremony for these delicious falafel. Now I have nothing against any other falafel place out there. For the most, I love them all! Being vegetarian, falafel is life for me! The thing with THESE falafel is the following: they're little, you bite into them and the crispy, crunchy crust that formed outside gets broken with your teeth. Once you go through that little crust you're taken into the fresh, green, soft world of the inner falafel where all the yumminess is at. It's kinda hard to find the perfect balance between crisp to moist ratio. Most of the time falafels can be a little dry in the inside. Not these guys. The sauces that it comes with is amazing. Make sure to try the spicy one, it turns up the heat a notch. Also, they sell their delicious Mamoun's Falafel hot sauce to go. If you're into grape leaves, do it! You won't regret it. Yummy spot, great options, cash only, worth it all!",0

We sat right at the back and was presented with the menu and also some hot Chinese tea. We were amazed at the extensive options offered. There were 7 types of noodles one could choose from as well as wide variety of the standard Chinese cuisines. We opted for some beef and tofu sizzling plates which unfortunately did not come sizzling at all but was nevertheless yummy. We also ordered some edamame, rice and other noodles dishes. All were polished nicely. The check at the end was pretty decent, averaging approx. $15 per dish including tax and tip.",0

14381,"Title: A Disappointing Ramen Experience at [Restaurant Name]

Unfortunately, my recent visit to [Restaurant Name] was rather underwhelming. I ventured to try the Shaki Shaki Spicy Ramen, which turned out to be a glaring misstep. The dish was disproportionate in its ingredients, overwhelmed by an abundance of bean sprouts as evidenced in the accompanying photo. A crucial component missing was meat, leading to a rather insipid bowl comprised mainly of noodles and veggies in an oddly unremarkable broth.

At a steep $20, the meal fell short of its value. The water served was tepid and had the unmistakable taste of tap water, adding to the lackluster dining experience. Service did not redeem the evening either, with a considerable wait time of nearly half an hour for a single seat in a cramped space during a busy Saturday night.

In retrospect, I should have heeded previous reviews and opted for the Torigara or Tontoro Pork ramen. My gamble on the Shaki Shaki unfortunately resulted in a spoiled dinner – a mistake I won't be repeating.",1

2975,"Stopped by this spacious establishment on a Monday afternoon post-work and was immediately intrigued by its medieval-themed decor complete with bench seating, ceiling windows, and a game-projecting screen. The ambiance transports you to another era.

Despite not catching the bartender's name (mystery number 3), he added a playful vibe to our visit—kudos! The all-day Happy Hour on Mondays was a steal, extending to a more typical 4-7pm slot during weekdays; not sure about weekends though.

Onto the fare: the menu offers simple yet sophisticated choices. We indulged in a soft pretzel accompanied by a rich beer cheese dip that was a treat for the taste buds, along with cheese sticks masked as a 'grilled cheese sandwich'—both generous in portion.

Drinks didn't disappoint either. The Mule was particularly delightful, as was the Red Ale. I'd recommend this place for group gatherings, although it's worth noting that the vibe was quite calm at 6pm. There was a lack of music, but with good company, it wasn't a miss.

Overall, a spot worth visiting, preferably later in the day or with a lively crew.",1
18110,"Title: A Modest Uptown Eatery - Adequate but Unremarkable

I recently dined at a local spot just a stone's throw from my place, drawn by proximity rather than any particular craving or buzz. The restaurant sits comfortably in the Manhattan pricing landscape, despite its uptown location – nothing that would break the bank.

The meal was a pedestrian journey through a trio of dishes: scallion pancakes, shrimp dumplings, and cold noodles. Each plate was the culinary equivalent of a polite nod – satisfactory, though lacking any distinct flair or flavor that demands a second taste.

Admittedly, I was thrown off by an audacious sticker boasting a spot in the ""50 best Chinese restaurants in New York"". Upon reflection, that claim could hinge on a technicality, perhaps only amongst establishments with a smaller online footprint.

While this restaurant doesn't have me hooked or looking forward to a return visit, it's a decent option if you find yourself on this particular block with a hankering for a sit-down meal. It's an addition to the neighborhood that's likely appreciated, even if nothing on the menu sets my world alight.",1
13568,"Title: A Love Letter to Chikarashi's Exquisite Lunches

Chikarashi is the kind of place that can turn a casual diner into a loyal devotee. If my wallet allowed, I'd gladly make this spot my lunchtime ritual every three days. It's not just a meal; it's an experience where the fish's quality takes center stage, demonstrating that simplicity, when done right, is the ultimate sophistication.

The Seared Hamachi is the dish of dreams – it's my absolute favorite. With each bite, its melt-in-your-mouth sensation left me in awe, entranced by the buttery consistency that somehow never waned. And for those seeking a classical poke adventure, the Goma Shoyu Tuna doesn't disappoint. It's my second favorite, providing a delightful nod to tradition, all the while making the word 'delicious' feel like an understatement.

In short, Chikarashi is a treasure trove of culinary finesse, especially for those in pursuit of the finest the ocean has to offer. Yum indeed.",1
20984,"A trip to NYC is not complete without some pizza. Best Pizza II was in walking distance of where we were staying. The place is small, with a couple of tables, perfect for eating a slice on the go. I tried a regular slice and a thin square slice called ""Grandma's"".  The ""Grandma's"" slice had a perfect crispy crust but the cheese was a little rubbery. In contract, the regular slice had nice bubbling cheese, but the crust was not crispy enough. Husband had a meatball slice which was full of meatballs. I would say the pizza overall was decent but not outstanding. Believe it or not, I have had better pizza in Florida!",0
10928,"Title: A Mixed Bag at Lucy's Cantina

As a first-time visitor to Lucy's Cantina for a business lunch, my experience was a blend of highs and lows. Stepping in at just before noon provided the advantage of being some of the only patrons, which resulted in attentive and quick service – essentials for the lunch hour. The restaurant's vibrant atmosphere and décor transported me straight to Mexico, and the anticipation of enjoying the rooftop during warmer days was a definite plus.

Unfortunately, the food did not live up to the lively ambiance. I was torn between the shrimp quesadilla and shrimp taco, and at the suggestion of our waitress, I opted for the latter. It was a disappointment. Presented with just two lackluster tacos in a basket, I found myself facing a bland and unsatisfying meal, resorting to hot green sauce in an attempt to find some flavor. In stark contrast, my colleagues received more generous portions that left me enviously waiting as they finished their heartier dishes.

An unexpected chill in the restaurant added to my discomfort, compounded by the lack of hot beverages to counteract the cold. This made it difficult to enjoy the meal and setting fully.

Lucy's seems like it could be a great spot for post-work drinks on the rooftop, but for a lunch that satisfies in taste and portions? It fell short. I remain curious about their other offerings and may give it another chance if I'm in the area, but unfortunately, this visit did not hit the mark for a commendable lunch spot.",1
13388,"This place is by far my most favorite brunch place in nyc. I've been to this location and the Soho location many times because I love almost everything on their menu and I always take anyone who's visiting nyc here. They serve delicious and wholesome brunches at reasonable prices, but you can come here anytime since their menu is all day long. The space is a bit tight but it's bearable and inside is really cute! If this is your first time coming to Ruby's you must get their bronte burger and fries with truffle aioli sauce. THEIR BURGER IS TO DIE FOR! The patty is so juicy, perfectly cooked, and blends excellently with the sauce, veggies, and panini bread. Even though it's named as burger, it's really a pressed panini/ more like a sandwich.Their fries are so crispy and the truffle aioli sauce is to die for. Their sweet potato fries are also really yummy if you prefer that to regular fries.Besides those two items, their shrimp pasta and creamy  chicken pasta are also delicious. I think they use similar sauce for both dishes but regardless they're so rich in flavor and come in a good portion. I can go on forever with their menu, but one last thing I recommend is their chicken avocado salad. While it's definitely less filling than other dishes, it's so yummy and I usually pair it with fries to share!",0
12785,"Extremely impressed and will come back for sure! Four of us went for brunch. One thing I did not care for- the entire table needs to participate for the price fixe which is a bummer. Second, you can't alternate the brunch entrees for the regular ones although the former is cheaper. Started with the bottomless bloody meeras and that was quite a kick start.Chilli cheese toast was nicely done. Whatever that bread is that they're using is simply superb. The dahi paneer thing was okay and not at par with other stuff. Paneer was very soft though. Madam ji- best thing I ate yesterday. Tender chicken pieces and cheese and bread and eggs. Comes with a summer salad and is excellent. Highly recommendedThe other star of the show was the banana leaf chicken. The coconut curry was delicious. Spicy yet subtle. Bone in Chicken added to the flavors as well.Kerala fried chicken was pretty good too. But could not top the madam ji. Oh, that bun was quite good.Did not try the uttapam thing but friend said it was good. Do not leave without the mawa tart. It is not sickly sweet and beautifully flavored with cardamom. Rabri is the bomb in that dish, really making you craving more. Definitely going back!!",0
15272,"Title: Quaint Spot with a Tasty Happy Hour

Walking into the establishment, I anticipated a traditional restaurant atmosphere. Surprisingly, we were greeted with an array of cozy small tables, giving off more of a casual vibe than expected. My friend and I arrived before the dinner rush around 5pm on a weekday and were promptly seated.

Excited to catch the happy hour specials, we ordered a pair of margaritas, priced attractively at $6.50 each, and noted that wine specials were also on offer. Our meal consisted of a duo of pulled pork tacos each, another set of fish tacos, and a shared small bowl of jambalaya. The pulled pork tacos emerged as the star of the show with a delicious combination of crisps and sweet corn, generously stuffed despite their petite size. The fish tacos, however, were underwhelming, reminiscent of the fish sticks from school cafeteria days.

For those interested in a bit of a kick, a selection of hot sauces was available to add some heat to the tacos. And while the bathroom might be a bit of an adventure to locate—camouflaged into the wall with a discreet ""push"" sign—it's part of the quirky charm of the place.

As the evening progressed, the restaurant filled up, echoing its popularity. While the ambiance may not align with initial expectations of a classic dining experience, the happy hour deals and the standout pulled pork tacos are good enough reasons to consider a visit.",1

If you are in the theater district and in the mood for pasta, you cannot do better than with the Sinfonia di paste. Unlimited table side service of 3 different pastas. Plus appetizer of salad or antipasto (do yourself a favor an order the antipasto).And while you are there, get a bottle of wine from their set price wine list.",0
1854,"I recently visited a cozy local eatery with a friend for a dinner night out. Despite the restaurant's small size, the space was well-organized, allowing for a comfortable dining experience. We started off with tomato meatballs, which were unfortunately underwhelming and could have benefited from a bit more cooking time.

The mac and cheese, on the other hand, was a massive hit, both in portion size and flavor – definitely a highlight of the meal. For my main course, I indulged in the sea bass, a personal favorite when it comes to seafood. The fish was delectable, perfectly cooked, and seasoned. However, I did find myself longing for a larger serving, especially since the taste was so enjoyable and the accompanying garnish was well-paired.

Dessert was an interesting take on s'mores, served uniquely with only melted sticky marshmallows. It was an okay attempt, though I missed the classic components like chocolate and graham crackers. Overall, the restaurant delivered a satisfying dining experience with a few misses but certainly worth a visit for that incredible mac and cheese and the mouth-watering sea bass.",1
16449,"Good upscale Chinese food in Chelsea Overall: 3.75/5Food: 4/5 Service: 3.5/5 Decor: 5/5 Value: 3/5 First off, the decor is beautiful and it's a very upscale experience. Also nicely located to other things like Chelsea market so there's a place to explore as you wait: We were quoted 20-30 min wait which was fine, but when we got there after the text notification that table was soon ready we had to wait a long while more and so it was more like 1 hr. That's really frustrating, since expectations were way off based on the estimate we were quoted. On to the food. We got various dishes including the lamb noodles ($22), jellyfish salad ($12), pork soup dumplings ($6 for 3), sticky rice dumplings ($6 for 3), eight spice tofu ($15), and pea shoots ($18). Eight spice tofu was incredible!! Super thin and crispy outside and silken soft tofu interior. Fantastic and a decent portion. The jellyfish salad was very underwhelming and not worth at all - some pieces of jellyfish which were delicious mixed in with a whole lot of raw onions in a spicy sauce. For the amount of jellyfish in the fish, not worth to get this. The pea shoots were well done, and a good potion, but $18 is a bit high for a cooking a single bunch of vegetable you can buy in a store for like $2-3 in a simple broth. The lamb noodles took the longest to come, and it was good and tasty but I think the sauce was a bit salty and there wasn't that much lamb. The dim sum of the dumplings were good and the prices aren't bad for those sides. Overall food quality was good but due to the prices, am going to be a bit more discerning and expect more. Overall it's a nice spot for upscale food. However, it seems like that'd be a lot of food we ordered (due to long wait, was a bit eager in ordering) and we were definitely full, but it wasn't like an excess of food portion wise. And we don't really have huge appetites in the first place. So for almost $100 for 2 post-tax and tip, for food only and no drinks or anything, it's pricey and not necessarily great value although it's a nice spot. Rounded up to 4 stars for the experience and quality.",0
14894,"I was craving steak so my friend and I were wandering around Little Italy, trying to find a place where it wasn't too expensive. No easy task, let me tell you! Finally, we agreed on this restaurant because the filet mignon sounded that impressive. The interior was warm, rustic and cozy with brick walls, along with a brown, yellow and orange color scheme. There were fairy lights, candles on the tables and ceiling lamps.We were served complimentary bread and there was oil, as well as vinegar already on the table, which was nice. The bread was a bit tough to chew though.For the meal, I ordered the grilled filet mignon topped with Gorgonzola in a mushroom wine sauce  and a side of polenta fries. The cost of this was $34. The size of the filet mignon was pretty hearty. I requested it be cooked medium well, so the exterior was slightly charred ever so perfectly. I loved the crispness and the interior was juicy and tender. The Gorgonzola was melted on top and was sooo delicious! The mushroom sauce was thick and rich with flavor, well seasoned and paired well with both the meat and Gorgonzola. There were only 4 polenta fries but they were quite thick and enjoyable to eat. The fries had a satisfying crunchiness and was chock full of tasty herbs and spices. I was very tempted by the dessert menu, but was too full to try any. I would like to try the chocolate soufflé and pistachio coppa next time. Service was pretty good. Our waiter was friendly and welcoming. The prices are on par with other restaurants in the area and in some cases, more reasonable.",0

Despite the skepticism brewed by a host of negative reviews, my recent brunch experience at this charming eatery was nothing short of delightful. This quaint gem not only offers an Instagram-worthy ambiance but also treats its patrons to the serene vistas of Central Park — a view that is sure to elevate any dining experience.

As for the food, the egg dishes we ordered were a sumptuous success, hitting all the right notes of flavor and finesse. Coupled with the staff's attentive service, our dining experience was smooth and enjoyable. However, due to my sister's nut allergy, we steered clear of the desserts, though an inside tip for those with a sweet tooth — opt for the 'hokey pokey' ice cream, an irresistible blend with toffee that's rumored to be a crowd-pleaser.",1
20057,Why this place isn't rated more stars is beyond me. The food and drinks here are wicked good. The chocolate chocolate martini was the perfect consistency. The braised bacon with the cheesiest grits and the pork it came wiith so juicy. The Sweeney beef was cooked a perfect medium and the mashed  potatoes it came with were so flavorful. I went with the fried pb&j because the other options you could get elsewhere. This was the best dessert I've had in a while. It was fried nicely and didn't taste oily which was great. The ice cream was a nice compliment.The place is small but we didn't have to wait long for seating. It really pays true tribute to Tim Burton.  The staff dress up as his characters and play the parts well. Server was so friendly and she can sing. I will def be back again.,0

Hibachi was the choice and my travel partner looked at was was nearby and picked Flame. She ordered the filet with extra veggies and I got the shrimp with miso soup. The soup was good, nice and hot. Our entrees were cold when they arrived and were doused with a sweet overpowering teriyaki. The vegetables and the shrimp tasted very one note. Even the salad dressing was overly sweet. I ate a few shrimp and veggies so I wouldn't be starving. This reminded me of one of those fast food Japanese places at a mall. The place was also completely empty except for a couple of people at the bar. Maybe it was a bad night. Definitely was for us. Completely underwhelming.",0

Chicken Tatsuta-age- fried chicken that had an appropriate amount of batter that didn't feel like you were eating tempura/popcorn chicken. It wasn't super oily too which I appreciated.  Niku Udon- The udons are quite interesting because they were a little flatter than the normal type. The broth was very clear and no fuss. They had plentiful meat and tripe so if you like that, you'd definitely enjoy thisCurry Udon- I was surprised by this bowl because it wasn't as thick as I expected. Usually when i have curry udon, the broth is thick and very bright milky yellow. The broth here almost felt like it was a mix of the Niku Udon soup base with curry.Honestly, this place deserves a 5-star but I came here not feeling hungry at all so the fact that I gave it 4-stars without an appetite shows how good this place is. Would I come again? Yes. I'd even wait 45min for it...and i hate waiting.",0

14694,"I was so thrilled to find that they have three different vegetarian ramen options! I went with the wasabi shoyu, because I'm a sucker for thick wavy noodles, and the other two veggie options came with the thin noodles. It was good, but I would try one of the other ones next time. The broth had a pleasant wasabi flavor, but I prefer a richer, creamier broth. It came topped with tempura flakes, which looked super cute (almost like Rice Krispies), but they got soggy within about 90 seconds, so I could have done without them. The tofu was good - all two bites of it. I paid the extra $2 for bakudan, their homemade spicy paste, and that was DELICIOUS. Spicy but not too spicy, and had this rich, savory flavor.",0
17911,"I had a delightful experience at this vibrant brunch venue on a Saturday afternoon. The atmosphere was lively, buzzing with upbeat music that added an extra spark to the ambiance. If it's your birthday, expect a joyous musical treat that makes the occasion special.

The highlight of my meal was the smoked salmon Eggs Benedict, dubbed Eggs Scandinavian here, which was simply exquisite. Perfectly poached eggs coupled with rich hollandaise and quality salmon made for a memorable dish.

However, there are a couple of caveats to note: this eatery operates on a cash-only basis, so be sure to swing by an ATM beforehand. Additionally, with only two single-stall restrooms available, the wait can be a bit of a hassle during peak hours.

Overall, a delightful spot for a lively brunch, provided you come prepared with cash and a little patience for the restroom.",1
14524,"Despite its prime Times Square location and the prestige of sharing a building with Ernst & Young, this well-known seafood chain left much to be desired. My recent visit, lured by the promise of a satisfying seafood experience, fell flat with the 'Pick 2' featuring grilled tilapia and scallops with an extra charge, totaling around $25. The single wood-grilled tilapia fillet was disappointingly overcooked and lacked any discernible seasoning. The scallops fared slightly better, though still far from remarkable. Accompanying vegetables like broccoli and asparagus did nothing to elevate the meal, offering an underwhelming display both in flavor and portion size. Given its specialty in seafood, the restaurant should have shined, but sadly I see no compelling reason to return.",1

Half tie Dye and half supreme. Both were great! Love the thin crust pizza, almost cracker like. We were so full afterwards.

14091,"Title: A Cozy Gem with Unforgettable Italian Flavors

I recently visited a charming little restaurant that deserves a strong 4.5-star rating. The place exuded intimacy and warmth, perfect for the post-Valentine's Day rush it was experiencing. The wait staff's friendliness complemented the cozy ambiance wonderfully.

Without hesitation, I indulged in my fondness for burrata, and this restaurant's take on the cheese did not disappoint. The bruschetta was a standout - a delightful blend of creamy burrata with mushrooms, and an innovative guacamole and lobster combination. The burrata appetizer, adorned with red shrimp, was equally delectable.

I followed with the cavatelli, which, while well-prepared, couldn't quite eclipse the brilliance of the starters. Then, the pièce de résistance - the cannolis. Simply put, they were a revelation; creamy, rich, with a perfect crunch in the shell. They nearly had me ordering a second helping.

This restaurant is poised to provide an exquisite date night, complete with sensational Italian fare. A return visit is definitely in my future, especially when the craving for Italian strikes.",1
10747,"2.5 stars. Pretty disappointed by the one thing they specialize in, which is beef noodle soup. I will say that the beef was very tender and flavorful, and the pickled mustard greens were tasty, but unfortunately that flavor didn't translate to the soup. I ordered it spicy and that's all I tasted. Spice. The soup wasn't nearly beefy enough and lacked depth.My friends and I split the tofu appetizer. The tofu itself was pretty good, but I don't like century egg.I did enjoy the yuzu beer, which was a pleasant surprise since I don't like beer all that much. The yuzu notes definitely came through and it was pretty refreshing.Glad I tried this place and can cross it off my list, but I won't be back.",0
13544,"Meh had way better pizza and I'm not talking Italy and way way better service and I'm not talking NYC.  I had to ask for salt shaker, which we didn't have at our table.  Perhaps they assumed they thought their pizza didn't need flavor?  The pizza was so bland ..... I can count the number of times I've used a salt shaker on one hand....in ANY restaurant let alone an Italian one.Truly had better pizza at a pizza by the slice place and there are a ton of them in the city.This is only my opinion and reflects my experience at this restaurant but I wouldn't come back.  Oh and did I mention EVEN though they have the credit card acceptance emblem on the front door they neglect to tell you they add a 4% surcharge on credit card sales.  Saying if you pay cash they don't charge the 4%.  They are probably breaking their card acceptance agreement with the credit card companies.  They deserve a two star but I'm giving them one star because of their payment policy surcharge.",0
1956,"Craving Italian food, I came into Barolo East for lunch today. The lunch special works like this: pick an appetizer, a main, and a dessert, for $25. I also received a basket of bread, with a garlic tomato oil sauce. Pretty affordable, considering the quality (and quantity) of the food. I started with the chicken livers, served on arugula. Never had this before. The chicken livers seemed to be cooked well; they crumbled in my mouth, very little chewing required. Perhaps not my personal favorite, but fans of this dish should give it a try. Next, the Pollo alla Barolo, a chicken breast coated in parmesan, smothered in a tangy sauce, served with various veggies. Delicious. The chicken was cooked just right, juicy, with the parmesan flavor kicking in at just the right moment. That said, I do like my chicken crispy, so I might have preferred the sauce on the side. Still, this was tasty and filling, and the veggies felt like a healthy choice. In the end, I got my tiramisu to go. Service was good throughout the meal: I needed a lot of water refills, and the waiter kept me sipping. I'll keep this place in mind for future special occasions.",0

Visiting at the prime time of 11 am, the dishes on display were at their freshest. Pricing proved reasonable for the daily specials, though the $9.80 for a Cuban sandwich initially raised an eyebrow. However, any doubts were swiftly dispelled by the flavorsome and satisfying taste, justifying the cost.

I've frequented Tacombi several times and decided it was high time my best friend from California experienced their flavors. Our lunch began on a refreshing note with Horchata and Agua de Sandía, complemented by a large sparkling water. While the Horchata didn't quite hit the mark for me, the staff was accommodating, allowing me to switch to another Agua de Sandía without fuss.

We indulged in a selection of their finest offerings, starting with the Corn Esquites—a dish that never disappoints with its authentic Mexican take on corn. Our taco tasting included the El Pastor, Acapulco Shrimp, and Baja Crispy Fish Tacos, all of which were nothing short of delicious. The Chilango Campechanos, a curious but enjoyable concoction, left us intrigued. It was different from the usual, evoking a mysterious yet pleasant flavor profile that tantalized our taste buds.

Our only lament was the absence of dessert—a sweet ending would have been the perfect finale to our flavorful journey. Overall, Tacombi maintains its charm and continues to be a go-to spot for a tasty escape into Mexican cuisine.",1

2290,"Title: A Grand Finale at Patsy's

As I capped off my birthday celebrations, I couldn't resist closing out at Patsy's – it's like stepping into a classic Goodfellas scene with an unbeatable atmosphere and consistently outstanding food. 

My companion and I ventured into the seafood selections with clams oreganata which he relished, while I dove into the stuffed artichoke. Despite the stuffing's flavorful charm, the leaves were a tad tough and could have used a bit more cooking time. A minor hiccup, however, as my usual go-to – the stuffed double cut pork chop accompanied by vinegar peppers – was as tender as ever, although slightly smaller than anticipated. 

The filet mignon Marsala across the table received high praise for its perfect cook and flavorful Marsala wine reduction. We wrapped up the meal sharing a slice of divine cannoli cake and savoring espressos, the epitome of a satisfying end. 

Patsy's is proof that old school charm never fades, complete with a reasonably priced nearby parking lot. Bear in mind, dining here is certainly a splurge – akin to a 'car payment bill.' Yet, it's worth it for the great people watching and the cast of characters that bring the place to life. Tomorrow I may return to salads and cardio, but tonight, Patsy's was a birthday treat I wouldn't trade.",1
13123,"Tucked away in the bustling streets of NY, this quaint eatery boasts a small dining room that cleverly avoids the sardine-can feel common in the city, with tables comfortably accommodating pairs and groups. With contemporary decor setting a tasteful atmosphere, one might expect a hefty price tag, yet the costs remain within reason. For a party of three, we dished out an average of $25 per person—minus gratuity—for a selection of four appetizers, a duo of noodle and rice mains, and a shared dessert, sans beverages.

The menu, while modestly priced, offered an underwhelming culinary journey. The larb kai lacked the expected punch and, regrettably, many dishes veered towards an indistinct sweetness. However, a bright spot was the fried fish cakes—a nostalgic offering scarce in many Thai establishments these days. For a sweet finale, the coconut pudding, neatly portioned into three petite dishes, was delightful and perfect for communal indulgence.

While the food did not rise to remarkable heights, this establishment earns recognition for its considerate layout and a few menu gems. Stumbling upon this spot on a whim turned out to be a rather pleasant surprise. This restaurant stands firmly at 3.5 stars, marking it as a decent option for those looking for a casual dine-in experience without extraordinary expectations.",1

I checked this place out because everyone was raving about how this place has amazing pizza.I ordered the pepperoni square and margherita pizza. Both of them were really good but the pepperoni square definitely stood out to me. The cheese and pepperoni go so perfectly together. It is a little on the heavy side but all the flavors go so well with each other. I've had so many pepperoni pizzas in my lifetime but I can say that this is one of the best pepperoni pizzas I have ever tasted. This place is definitely worth stopping by if you are in New York!!,0

10357,"Title: A Promising Start for Canal Street Oysters

Canal Street Oysters has burst onto the local dining scene as a refreshing new establishment. The spacious and elegantly designed interior, crowned with a striking central bar, sets an inviting stage for oyster enthusiasts and seafood lovers. The menu shines with an impressive selection of oysters and raw seafood, showcasing the restaurant's dedication to oceanic fare.

While the non-seafood options are currently sparse, there is potential for menu expansion that could elevate the dining experience for those seeking variety. The beverage offerings boast an extensive range of beers and spirits to suit diverse tastes, yet the wine list falls short of expectations, particularly given the sophisticated palates of Soho and Tribeca patrons.

In its nascent stage, Canal Street Oysters exhibits immense promise. With a few adjustments, particularly a richer wine selection and an enriched menu, it's poised to become a neighborhood gem.",1
18633,"So happy this place has opened up in Washington Heights! I've already been twice since its so close to my apartment and has lots of space to hang out (compared to a lot of places around here). I like the selection of different burgers, beers and cocktails. So far, the food is decent but not blow my mind. I do like to hope around the menu and try different things and there are still plenty of things I want to try. The first time I went here I had the pig dip. It was a little toasty and salty for my taste. And I felt like the au jus just made it even more salty. The last time I went I had the Graceland which was the most intriguing for me. I wish the peanut sauce had a stronger flavor. I think the bacon (which I enjoyed) over powered it and so did the overly peppered burger patties. The fries though are always great. Hoping they will expand their menu more though.My next goal is to come here for brunch and Tuesday trivia! Excited to see where this place goes.",0

Not a big rip off as other places.Came here on a Friday night for a friend""s birthday. they don't take reservations so we came early. We got sat right away, party of 6. Decor - the place is decorated nicely. looks like a cafe more than a seafood place. I personally think, the walls were a bit too crowded. When it comes to decoration, sometimes less is more (this doesn't apply to food, of course! Lol). Food - to start with spicy salted peanuts -- just yum! I coudn't stop eating those suckers lolWe ordered the $99 combo for 2-4 people, it comes with 2 appetizers (wings, crispy calamari or Cajun fries, we got fries complementary of the house) and a seafood selection (dungeon crab) in a spicy garlic sauce. The sauce had LOTS of garlic. It was just so good.We also got the noodles with shrimps. Surprisingly the noodles were very good. Sauce was super tasty. I wish the noodles were a bit more al dente, they were on the soggy side but not too bad.Then the famous salted egg yoke crabs. You can really taste the egg. They were perfectly done, just a bit too greasy. Service was great. Our waitress was very nice and the busboys were very attentive. They keep refilling our water and emptying the buckets. PS. You get free soda with yelp check in. They honor all 6 of our check-ins. Highly recommend this place and best of all, it's 1/2 of the price I've paid at other places.",0

We asked for some water and they gave us a carafe of water leftover from another table (gross). Will not be back based on the service. Waitress was very rude and refused to give us fresh water. Dump out the water when a table leaves and give new customers fresh water.,0
13020,"Title: Quaint and Quirky – A Hidden Gem

I stumbled upon this charmingly unassuming Asian eatery tucked away in the hustle and bustle of the neighborhood. Don't let its diminutive size fool you—the service here is second to none. It's a snug space where the pace is upbeat, and the food is both hearty and swiftly served.

Their menu stands out for its flexibility. For someone who avoids pork, the range of alternative options was refreshing. I opted for the bam bam noodles with customizable add-ons for a negligible extra fee. It's worth noting, however, that there are no restroom facilities available.

The eye of lychee drink was a delightful treat, brimming with the freshness of real fruit. In contrast, the Hong Kong milk tea was a bit underwhelming and could benefit from a bolder flavor profile.

Nevertheless, the positives heavily outweigh the minor critique. This spot has earned a return visit from me, and I wholeheartedly recommend it for a quick, satisfying meal. 4/5 stars.",1
17258,"Soft, delicious pastries and breads. I love this spot, although on the crowded side since its in the middle of Chelsea Market. I'm a bit claustrophobic and can only handle crowd for a bit before I go crazy. Smart me decides to live in New York, go figure. Anyway, sorry about ky ADHD. Love this spot! They also have a sitting area where you can watch the workers bake and make the products.Definitely worth coming to and you get to explore Chelsea Market after!",0
15205,"Title: A Carnivore's Delight

I had the pleasure of dining at a meat-centric restaurant that truly impressed with its offerings. While the prices lean towards the higher end, making it ideal for group outings, the quality and presentation of the dishes justify the expense.

Our culinary journey began with luxurious bites of foie gras and uni, which, despite being sold by the piece and on the pricier side, I found utterly delectable and worth the splurge for their richness and flavor.

The service was informative and engaging, with our waitress detailing the meats presented and suggesting compatible sauces, enhancing our dining experience. The presentation was a spectacle itself, especially with the ""treasure chest meat box,"" which was a standout moment that the restaurant proudly showcased, encouraging photos of the dramatic reveal.

While we rounded off the meal with desserts - a matcha puff and chestnut crepe cake - they were fairly ordinary. Desserts may not be their forte and, though pleasant, could be skipped without missing much.

In conclusion, I'd wholeheartedly recommend this establishment for celebratory occasions or special group dinners, given that exploring the variety of high-quality meats can add up. The experience is well worth it for meat enthusiasts.",1
11072,"Came here before a show at Pier 17 with my boyfriend and had a great meal. We shared a Caesar salad and the old fashioned pizza with half pepperoni, half sun-dried tomatoes and basil. It was way too much for the two of us but we did our best. Everything was delicious and the outdoor patio seating was really nice. Definitely want to return with more friends so I can try more pizza!!",0
13487,"Title: A Delicious Surprise After Gulliver's Gate

Having wandered out of Gulliver's Gate on 44th Street with a hankering for pizza, I unexpectedly stumbled upon a gem of an Asian restaurant, much to my gastronomic delight. The allure of free Spring Rolls for checking in was a pleasant bonus to an already appealing venue. These weren't just any Spring Rolls—they were done right, setting the tone for an impressive meal ahead.

The Spicy Pork Dumplings and Scallion Pancakes I sampled were unlike any I've had before, possibly climbing the ranks to become my new favorites. The photos I took scarcely do justice to the savory appeal of the dishes, yet they're bound to whet any appetite with a glance.

For the main course, we indulged in Mongolian Beef, the tantalizing 'Golden Desert' Spicy Pork, and a communal serving of Pork Fried Rice, all of which were devoured without a trace left for leftovers. The attentive service kept our table clutter-free, enhancing the dining experience.

However, as perfect as the evening seemed, it was slightly marred when we were quickly presented with the bill post-meal, without an offer of dessert or coffee. This rush towards the end is the sole reason I'm withholding a full five-star rating.

In conclusion, for anyone in the Broadway area, this restaurant is a must-try—you won't be disappointed. Just remember to express interest in sweetening the meal's end if you’re not ready to call it a night.",1
10867,"Title: A Gem in Little Italy - Delightful Dining Experience

After a delightful day wandering through the wonders of the natural history museum, my companions and I were enticed to explore the culinary offerings of Little Italy. Amidst the somewhat limited selection and the bustling street vibe that didn't quite strike our fancy, a charming gentleman outside a cozy restaurant caught our attention with his persuasive pitch. 

He certainly set the bar high, and I'm thrilled to report that the experience within did not falter. The house wine was a treat, with a refined blend that's rare to find in such an unassuming establishment. The true stars of the show, however, were the burrata and the lasagna. The burrata was creamy and fresh, a perfect start to our meal. As for the lasagna, it was a rich layering of flavors that warmed the soul, reminiscent of an authentic Italian grandmother's cooking.

In short, this pleasant find turned out to be the highlight of our culinary adventure in Little Italy. It's a spot I'd readily recommend for anyone seeking a taste of Italy without boarding a plane.",1
20362,"I had the pleasure of visiting this establishment through my Mealpal subscription and decided to try the shrimp and lobster roll. To my delight, the roll exceeded my expectations. The seafood was exceptionally fresh, abundant, and succulent, with a delightful buttery essence that accentuated the flavors without overwhelming them. The bread, lightly toasted, was the perfect vessel for the delicate meat, and the absence of mayo allowed the natural flavors of the lobster and shrimp to take center stage.

The only drawback of my experience was the limited seating available. With only one seat, this spot is clearly designed for a quick bite rather than a leisurely meal. Despite this, the quality of the food makes a return visit a certainty for me. 'Lobster GoGo' might suggest a fleeting visit, but the taste of their rolls will linger in your memory, compelling you to 'go go' back for more.",1
17141,Best omakase so far in NY. Quality and price can't beat. So happy to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday here. All fish is fresh and firm texture. Service are polite and efficient. Book for sushi bar for omakase. 15 pcs omakase sushi and handroll for $105 is a steal. What a hidden gem. Glad that my acquaintance told me about this place,0
19571,"This was amazing. There's lots of hype for this place right now, and rightfully so, in my opinion.First visit, we got the following (in order of when it came out):- Scallop ceviche- Hamachi tiradito- Duck nigiri- Lobster/beef heart- Chicken thigh maki- Iberico pork with pesto udonI didn't order these by preference because I don't know that I'd be able to. The only dish that I don't think I'd feel strongly about getting again was the pork with udon, although that was actually my wife's favorite entree. All the others were essentially perfect, in my opinion, and I'd be sad to skip any of them. (Realistically, we'd probably skip the surf and turf, because my wife wasn't as crazy about it, and was particularly freaked out by the beef heart, which I thought was incredible.) The ceviches are worth a particular extra mention. These were about as good as I've ever had anywhere, and if I had unlimited money, I would get all three as an automatic start to a meal here. They're expensive for the volume you're getting, but so amazing.The duck nigiri is also fantastic, but again very expensive for the volume. Rightfully so, but expensive nonetheless. The entrees are a much better value, in our experience -- all three were either voluminous (the pork/udon) or pretty heavy (chicken maki and lobster/beef heart). I didn't expect this, but the chicken actually ended up being my favorite of the three -- the roll itself is so good, and aji amarillo sauce it gets doused in was such an incredible touch.I'm putting this place in a similar mental bucket as a place like Cosme -- amazing food, but expensive relative to volume. We'll certainly be back for another splurge night at some point.",0
18271,"I recently visited this restaurant with high hopes for their corn esquites, a dish I usually can't resist. However, I was left deeply disappointed. Despite the quick service, the overall experience was a letdown, especially when drawing comparisons to the likes of Chipotle. Authenticity in Mexican cuisine was notably absent, and the quality of the rice was poor enough to be distinguishable. Unfortunately, this visit will be my last.",1
2543,"Title: Mixed Feelings at a Trendy Nightspot

My companions and I dropped into this cozy establishment on a Tuesday evening, intrigued by its connection to the reputable Angels Share. While the space's limited capacity required a brief wait, the cordial hostess promptly offered us the option to enjoy drinks while we stood, softening the inconvenience.

My initial choice, 'The Smoke', did not disappoint, delivering a familiarly exquisite taste reminiscent of its sister venue. Once seated, however, our experience was marred by our waitress's chilly demeanor. Her apparent irritation at our decision to focus on drinks over dinner—despite their higher price point—cast a pall over our table. Our interactions were minimal and polite, yet her displeasure was a constant undercurrent throughout the evening.

The drinks themselves were a highlight, with 'The Japanese Old Fashion' and 'The Penicillin' entering the mix, though neither outshone my preference for 'The Smoke'. Gastronomically speaking, the pork belly and shrimp buns were a flavorful addition to our nightcap, albeit slightly overgenerous with the Kewpie mayo.

In conclusion, while the venue's ambiance and cocktails hit the mark, our enjoyment was compromised by the unwelcoming service. A delightful hostess salvaged what could have been a dismal rating, but a word of advice to management: a conversation about customer service might be in order to align the staff's attitude with the standard set by both the drinks and the establishment's reputation.",1
1100,"Unfortunately, don't think I'll be returning. Got the spicy tuna roll and it was so mushy and did not taste very fresh. Only redeeming quality was the shrimp tempura I also got, but even that was subpar. Disappointed that the food was not what I expected since this is the second time I've ordered from here.",0

13305,"I recently had the pleasure of indulging in a burger at this eatery, and I must say, it was a genuinely satisfying experience. The burger was remarkable, epitomizing what a classic American cheeseburger should be. While the option to add egg and bacon exists, I found these toppings to overshadow the burger's natural charm. In essence, the burger stands out on its own, making additional garnishes superfluous. If you're in search of an authentic and delicious cheeseburger, this is the place to go.",1
17723,"Superb thai place.  Make a reservation! PROS:  beautiful interior and attention to detail at every turn.  Waitstaff was very prompt and friendly.  The food came quickly and was so flavorful.  The mussels... wow.  Had them made extra spicy and the broth was 5 stars alone.  This was my favorite dish. The shumai/dumplings were a little bland but still fresh. Pad thai was really good but requested additional spice, which they promptly brought. I didn't get photos of all the dishes at the table,  just a few,  but everything I saw was a work of art. Very clean restrooms. CONS:   a little tight for seating and very busy.   OVERALL:   This place is worth the trip!   Excellent Thai food and worthy of 5 stars all around.",0
1390,"We were on a quest to find the best NY Pizza! This place definitely it!! We got the caprese, fresh mozzarella, mozzarella with spinach, pepperoni, pepperoni with onion, sausage, and mushrooms. YOU MUST GET THE FRESH MOZARELLA and CAPRESE. They toast your pizza when you order so it has a crispy crust. The pizza is not greasy at all and folds perfectly!!! Tip: The fresh mozarella topped with powdered garlic and red pepper takes the pizza to the next level!! Only like a handful of seating inside (along the walls). Theres like 2 or 3 tables where you can stand and eat your pizza. I would say max 25 to 30 people inside at a time. Line goes by quick so wait is not absurd. I will say we tried the 3 top rated pizza places around time square and this was the best one.",0
3392,"Ive been here as part of a night out as well as for brunch. Both were great experiences! There was a good night life vibe with decent prices. We bought a lit city voucher for brunch without really knowing the menu (it was released a few weeks after buying the voucher) and  it ended up being really great! We had a carafe of mimosa - though I may have preferred that it was not premixed. We then shared the breakfast flatbread, mac and cheese burger, and French toast. All were amazing and I look forward to having them again!",0
11785,"I would definitely come back here for a second visit. It is a very large restaurant. They initially bring you out warm toasted bread. We decided to come here right before our Jlo Concert. From what I heard they typically play the music of the artist they are playing. Now wether that is true or not or it was just ironic that they were playing back to back J Lo Music, who knows? Either way, was a nice touch. We ordered the fried Mozzarella and Fried Calamari to start. Both were beautifully fried, not oily, and had the perfect crunch. For dinner we ordered the chicken parmesan, meatballs, lobster and squid ink pappardelle, and seafood with pasta. I know that these are not the correct names on the menu but I unfortunately did not take a photo of the menu nor am I writing this immediately after our visit so I cannot remember the proper menu names of the entrees. In either case, the pasta, you can tell is home made. Everything about the pasta was amazing and unlike any other pasta I have had. I rarely get to have home made fresh pasta, and my hopes is that I am right because the pasta was phenomenal. It was not too thin and the perfect thickness. I loved the taste and amount of lobster to pasta there was. Typically places either give an equal lobster to pasta/side order size OR you get two pieces of lobster claw and thats it. Love this place and cannot say enough positive things. Will be back.",0
12707,"This place is a extremely busy, and it has been our go place for some times now. The services were good, this Cantonese cuisine however is not up to the traditions anymore, the dishes were getting saltier, for example the steamed whole fish is getting filleted (user friendly for non-Asians )!!This neighborhood recently is getting much gentrified, so the restaurant is shifting its balance more to its western customers, that even allowing ones may bring their own liquor, and the corkage free of charge!m",0
19115,"We had a 2pm matinee on Broadway and I was looking for a brunch spot that was new and offered some healthy options. At first glance the menu for Westville is chock full of options, most of them including fresh greens and veggies. When we arrived around 12:30, the place was hopping. We were greeted by an extremely friendly hostess who took us to a table immediately. There is a bar where people were eating, enjoying cocktails and coffees and just adding to the neighborhood vibe. Our server greeted us immediately and was super friendly. She offered us cocktails. We had a Bloody Mary, St. Germain Mimosa, and a Pumpkin cocktail. All three were delicious. Brunch did not disappoint! We started with maduros plaintains and then had the smoked salmon salad, the burrito, and the California Benedict. Each dish was fresh and delicious. Exactly what we were looking for. The place is adorable. The manager had just decorated for Halloween and we were having ALL of it! Bathrooms spotless and just an overall fantastic vibe. We will certainly be back very soon!",0
3046,"Tucked away in the bustling business district, this decent-sized restaurant proves to be a hidden gem, especially on a busy Friday when the work crowd swarms in for lunch. Lucky enough to snag a stool at the bar, I was met with a limited yet appealing menu dominated by pizzas, pastas, and sandwiches that are priced on par with entrees.

Opting for the Prosciutto & Fresh Mozz Sandwich, reasonably priced at $12, and an $8 draft beer, I was pleasantly surprised by the prompt service. Within 15 minutes, I was presented with a hefty hero, generously filled with thick cuts of prosciutto and mozzarella, a smattering of greens, and a flavourful sauce hugged by a soft bun. The sandwich was surprisingly satisfying and harmonized well with the crispness of the pilsner.

The quick service here is commendable; they clearly recognize the time constraints of their clientele. For anyone seeking an affordable sit-down meal in an area with limited options, this is certainly a spot worth visiting.",1
301,Awesome place for Thai food!! We enjoyed dinner here on a Friday night and luckily we only had to wait 15 minutes to be seated. Food came quick. We ordered the pick three appetizers and the chicken satay was super salty so I don't think I would get that next time. The spring rolls were good and so were the chicken dumplings. My shrimp Thai fried rice was also tasty as well as the spicy basil rice. The Top thai drink was super unique and pretty!,0
19689,"Made a last minute reservation for a table of four on a Saturday night (2/1/20). New spot in the area with a welcoming interior and plenty of table/bar seating. Decided on the ""Pollo"" entree ($18) - a well cooked chicken breast sitting on top of marinated asparagus and red beet mash. To boot, there was also free warm bread to start, but served with cold butter (hard to spread). No liquor as of yet as they are still trying to get the license sorted.Problems: was given a table near the wall where unfortunately there was an exposed heating pipe that's hot to the touch. Manager said she'd move the table after a few people cleared away (never did, we ended up moving ourselves). Had to flag down waitress to put in our order after several failed attempts to get their attention. Food took quite some time to come out - even after waitress saying it would be right out. Looks like they don't have the kinks worked out here yet; hopefully things will get better.",0

The vibe here is lively and infectious, matched by the brilliance of their beer selection.

I wholeheartedly recommend this spot and look forward to returning with friends and family whenever I'm downtown.",1
17535,"My friend and I came here on a Friday night so it was pretty packed but we managed to get seats at the bar. Of course we had to start with Sake which they serve in these cute shot glasses (for lack of better terms). To start we got the 5 different types of sashimi which was pretty good though to be frank I've had better. Soba Totto does have a wide variety of yakitori and most of them are good (highly recommend the tsukene/meatball one) but some are a complete miss such as the kawa/skin and sunagimo/gizzard. If I had to pick my favorite item, it had to be the uni soba. It was refreshing and filling. All in all, Soba Totto does have pretty good food but there are cheaper izakaya-style options in the midtown area such as Izakaya MEW.",0
14500,"I came here today with my cousin for lunch. The inside is very trendy and the lights looked like lanterns. We ordered off the lunch set menu which included an appetizer and an entree. We shared the steamed dumplings, grilled Japanese eggplant, pad kee mao, and the basil fried rice. Everything was delicious and bursting with flavor. Neither of us like spicy foods so we asked the waitress to make everything mild and they did exactly that. I will definitely be coming back in the future!",0
11181,"**Restaurant Review: Nur**

Nur, aptly named, is a new entrant on the dining scene that begs the question: does it live up to the hype? Cast in a minimalist décor reminiscent of a quaint family home, minus the overpowering scent of auntie’s perfume, it sets a certain nostalgia in motion. Yet, be warned: if tranquility is what you seek, aim to dine before the clock strikes 6:30 pm; any later, and you'll be engulfed in a cacophony rivaling a political debate.

The atmosphere pulsates with a Tel Avivian energy that's undeniably infectious. It's a hotspot for those looking to reconnect with cultural roots that, perhaps not long ago, they kept discreetly understated. Amidst the buzz, the staff maneuvers with the swiftness of seasoned politicos catering to a demanding crowd.

At the bar, you're confronted with an extensive list of libations, from seven signature cocktails to a wine selection as complex as Talmudic discourse. Their Israeli Cabernet is notably commendable, and the 'Don't Bring Me Down' cocktail packs a punch befitting its name. The 'Penny Lane' is a curious concoction that eventually finds its footing in the realm of rich desserts.

As for the fare, it's a modern twist on Middle Eastern classics. The Kubaneh bread, a dreamy alternative to the traditional brioche, and the Jerusalem Bagel, an innovative take served with unique accompaniments, are sheer delights that may invoke a sense of nostalgia so profound it's almost transformative.

Other dishes hit or miss the mark. The Beef Tartare, while a departure from tradition, wins you over with its vibrant fusion of flavors. Yet, the Shrimp Qatyef proves disappointing, with key elements going amiss. The Jaffa Souvlaki's presentation may seem haphazard, and its seasoning slightly overdone, while the special Peppered Beef Tenderloin could benefit from a lesson in restraint and precision.

Dessert, at least, is a haven for chocoholics, delivering on all promised textures and tastes. The meal concludes on a high note with delightful Tahini Cookies that make for a fond farewell.

In a nutshell, Nur is a vivacious and ambitious venture that, despite its inconsistencies, leaves you intrigued and, in moments, thoroughly impressed. Opt for the quieter tables up front to enjoy the scene without the battle of the decibels, and perhaps Nur will find",1

I recently visited a charming little pub that offered a satisfying selection of beers and the added entertainment of a pool table. While it's true that they don't appear to serve a full food menu, the complimentary UTZ potato chips were a nice touch. This place is fine for a casual drink or a round of pool; however, if you're in search of a more comprehensive experience in New York, you might want to explore other venues that cater more fully to your dining and entertainment desires.",1

Oramen was the perfect place to do this.As soon as I walked in, the bartender greeted me and made me feel so welcome at the bar. I was intrigued by the matcha soju cocktail and it did not disappoint. It was foamy and refreshing, with strong hints of matcha. Matcha lovers unite! The Tonkatsu ramen was spot on. They unfortunately can't adjust the salt level, but the flavor was solid. Great texture for the thin noodles and the pork was fresh. They also cooked the egg just right! Oramen's menu is super diverse - everything from traditional Izakaya dishes, tons of noodles/rice options, and quite the selection of sake as well. I really want to come back to try the Katsu sandos and other Izakaya dishes. P.S. Get here before happy hour ends at 7! It gets absolutely packed after 730-8pm.",0

Review:

I recently visited this local BBQ hotspot and was blown away by the experience. The meat was exceptionally well-marinated, packed with flavor, and there was an impressive variety of dishes to choose from. Adding to the excitement, the restaurant's giant monkey mascot made an appearance to celebrate a birthday in our group, delivering an energetic rendition of the happy birthday song. Be prepared for the mascot to make multiple rounds throughout the night, entertaining different tables with a festive dance. The combination of delicious food and lively entertainment made for an enjoyable and memorable dining experience. Highly recommended for anyone looking for great food paired with fun!",1
16543,"During a recent neighborhood exploration, my companion and I stumbled upon a quaint, old-school diner for lunch. The extensive menu offered a lot of choices, and I settled on a chicken Caesar wrap accompanied by fries, coleslaw, and a pickle, rounding it off with a cup of coffee.

The wrap was satisfyingly filled with a hearty amount of chicken and fresh greens, and the fries struck that ideal balance of crispy and tender. The slaw also left a pleasant impression, adding a nice touch to the meal.

Unfortunately, the experience was marred slightly by service missteps. Despite the diner being nearly empty at 3 PM, my request to switch from a cramped booth to a more comfortable table was declined as they were supposedly reserved for larger parties. Moreover, the service faltered with a noticeable lack of attention; I needed to prompt the waiter twice for a coffee refill, which dampened the otherwise enjoyable visit.

This diner has the potential to be a great spot with its tasty food, but the service needs to be more attentive and accommodating to truly shine. Currently, I would rate it at three stars, with room for improvement.",1

20507,"I recently visited a new and impeccably clean pizzeria in Little Italy/Nolita, where I sampled their very thin crust cheese pizza. The crust was pleasingly crisp, and each bite of the soft and delicious cheese was enjoyable, albeit not as cheesy as I would have liked. While the $3 price tag for a slice is standard for the area, I found myself missing the stringy, stretchy cheese that lends itself to that satisfying pull-away from the slice. Although the experience was average, pizza aficionados who prefer a less cheesy topping might still appreciate what this spot has to offer.",1

I recently visited this establishment during their happy hour (5-8pm, M-F) and was thoroughly impressed. Despite being the sole bartender and waiter, the staff member was exceptionally efficient, delivering our drinks promptly and ensuring we were well-attended.

Though I skipped the lychee martini due to personal taste, it was a popular choice around me. I indulged in the rum punch, red sangria, and the coco shot—a sweet concoction of coconut rum and Red Bull that packed more rum than energy drink. The rum punch was definitely the highlight.

An added bonus was the cleanliness of the bathrooms, which is always appreciated. Highly recommend this spot for anyone looking for quality drinks and attentive service.",1
11670,"Title: A Delightful Dining Experience at a Charming Spot

From the moment I stepped in, this charming restaurant won me over with its delightful staff and minimalist aesthetics. The warmth of the service enhanced the dining experience, making it truly memorable.

My choice was a mix of 1/2 riceberry and 1/2 cabbage, a combination I found deliciously innovative. Paired with tofu, mashed potatoes, sriracha zucchini, and a flavor-packed massaman curry, the meal was a treat to the taste buds. The portions were generous, yet the plate's design ensured a satisfying meal without leaving you overstuffed.

The robust flavors meant that next time, I'd opt for sauce on the side to better control the intensity. Nonetheless, this gem of a place with its gorgeous simplicity and top-notch food has earned my highest recommendation.",1
13377,Four of us stopped in here for a  beer before going to a broadway show.  We went downstairs to the pub and found a table.  It was fairly crowded but we got served fairly quickly.  It is a pretty cool place.  We didn't eat there so I cannot comment on the food.  It is a very touristy spot but that is to be expected as it is right off from Times square.It served the purpose of what we needed... a place for a drink out of the cold!,0
16106,"My recent visit to this West Village gem for a complimentary meal showcased their specialty: clay pot rice. Opting for the combination, my boyfriend and I were pleased with the generous portions and affordable prices, a rarity in the area.

The option to add hot soy sauce is a game-changer, enhancing the dish with a delightful crispy layer. The eel was a standout among the meats, while the Chinese sausage fell short for my taste, but the variety in the combination pot ensured a satisfying experience overall.

Beverage-wise, the tea drinks, albeit canned and not homemade, were still a refreshing complement to the meal – just note they might be found cheaper elsewhere.

In all, the restaurant offers a satisfying, budget-friendly Asian meal with a few minor caveats to consider.",1

The dressing was a delightful surprise, far from the hit-or-miss experiences I've had elsewhere, and the salad itself boasted more than just the usual greens.

The chirashi itself was the star of the show. Each slice of fish was fresh, and the variety offered ensured every bite was a new delight. The salmon, in particular, was exceptional and had me savoring every morsel. Based on this experience, I am already looking forward to my next lunch visit to this gem of a sushi spot.",1

On a day perfectly suited for soup, I finally visited the much-talked-about noodle shop. Opting for the lamb noodle soup, I was immediately struck by its appealing presentation and the undeniable freshness of the ingredients. Although priced slightly above what one might expect in Chinatown, the $16 dish justified every penny.

The broth arrived steaming - a testament to its freshness - and the rice noodles showcased an ideal balance of bounce and tenderness, having been cooked just right. The lamb was noteworthy as well; it carried a subtle hint of pineapple that added a unique twist to each spoonful. Based on the experience, this eatery certainly warrants a return visit.",1
13047,"During my recent visit to the restaurant, I had a mixed culinary experience. The Brussels sprouts left something to be desired, coming across as rather mediocre.

Dessert was a refreshing close to the meal, featuring berries that burst with an unexpectedly delightful sweetness, revealing their utmost freshness.

Complementing the meal was the exceptional customer service. The waitress stood out with her articulate menu descriptions and thoughtful suggestions, adding a personalized touch to the dining experience. Overall, the restaurant proved to be a place where the highs truly elevate the entire experience, making it a recommended spot for both vegan cuisine enthusiasts and those with a penchant for sweet, fresh endings.",1
10206,"**Sichuan Delights: A Hidden Gem in Midtown**

Tucked away in the bustling heart of Midtown, just a stone's throw from the 57th St train station and a short walk from Columbus Circle and Central Park, is a Sichuan haven that’s been hiding in plain sight for a decade. It’s remarkable to find such authenticity so far from Flushing or Chinatown.

Upon arrival, our party of four was promptly seated in the not-yet-busy dining area, hinting at the efficient service we were about to experience. The menu boasted a variety of traditional Sichuan dishes, complemented by a full bar and an extensive wine selection.

Our table sampled the classic fish fillet and mapo tofu, along with the beef and tripe appetizer - all of which transported us straight to Sichuan province. The recommended dishes, including roast duck, frog legs, and a succulent, skin-on lamb stew, did not disappoint. The fish, in particular, packed the fiery punch you’d expect from Sichuan cuisine, while the lamb stew was tender and bursting with flavor.

Service was exemplary; attentive without being intrusive, with servers frequently checking in to ensure our satisfaction. Prices ran a bit higher than your average Sichuan spot, but considering the prime location, cozy ambiance, and outstanding food quality, they still felt like quite the bargain.

The presence of regulars is always a good sign, and there were many seemingly loyal patrons enjoying their meals. With two spacious floors and a private dining area that can comfortably seat 20, this spot is well-equipped for larger gatherings.

For those in the vicinity, take advantage of their within-a-mile delivery service for a taste of Sichuan at your doorstep. 

In short, this Sichuan restaurant is a culinary treasure in an area flooded with dining options. It’s perfect for a quick lunch or a leisurely dinner soaked in the rich flavors of traditional Sichuan fare.",1
11720,"Title: A Shroom Town Convert at [Restaurant Name]

I've always been on the fence about pizza, but [Restaurant Name] has completely flipped the script for me! Their Shroom Town pizza, drizzled with white truffle oil, is an absolute masterpiece. Unlike my usual approach, where the crust gets neglected, the cracker-like base on this pizza had me devouring every last crumb. I've indulged in this culinary delight twice now, and on both occasions, it's been a clean-plate situation.

Aside from the pizza, the house salad with that delectable garlic balsamic dressing has remained a constant in my dining experience here. I can confidently say this – I am now a loyal enthusiast, recommending this place to friends who've also become fans. [Restaurant Name] is now a must-visit spot for me whenever I'm back in town. Next up, introducing my husband and kid to this game-changer!",1

20927,"Title: A Cozy Corner Serving Authentic Yunnan Delights

Tucked away off the beaten path, this diminutive culinary delight proved itself a true hidden gem. Despite its size, it was the flavors that captivated during a bustling Saturday evening visit, where a modest wait of 20 minutes prefaced the start of a memorable meal.

The Kunming Tender Beef Rice Noodle, the star of the show, showcased beef so tender from its three-hour slow cook, it effortlessly melted in the mouth. Complemented by a symphony of fresh mint, chives, and pickled vegetables, the dish was a testament to the authenticity and flavor prowess of Yunnan cuisine.

An unsuspecting twist came in the form of the Hometown Street Fries. Anticipating sweetness, I was taken aback by an intriguing spicy and salty profile that married beautifully with the humble fry.

Pros include the rich, multifaceted flavors that transport you straight to Yunnan. However, the compact space can lead to a packed house, and the portions suggest a strategy: pairing an appetizer with your main ensures a satisfied appetite.

In conclusion, if you're on the hunt for genuine Yunnan fare and don't mind cozy quarters, this restaurant is a must-try. Just remember to bring your appetite for both food and adventure.",1
13107,"Look out, Washington Heights! You've got a gem of a restaurant on your hands with SUROSS. I finally got around to trying this place, after hearing great things through the grapevine for a few months. And it definitely lived up to the hype!I had the Tom Kha chicken soup to start. The coconut milk was fresh and balanced well with the lemongrass/khafir lime leaves. The chicken practically melted in my mouth, it was so tender. The soup was a perfect mix of sweet, savory, and zesty.I also got the Sriracha fried rice, and the first word that comes to mind is 'fresh.' Every ingredient in this dish tasted great, and there was no heaviness or excess oil used. The spice was perfect, and the thinly-sliced chicken breast was phenomenal. Such a fantastic dish, and I can't wait to go back and try more!The restaurant seems more geared toward takeout, as there aren't too many dine-in seats available. Staff was so incredibly friendly and accommodating, I was really impressed with their attention to their customers. Definitely check this place out, it may well be the best Thai food in the area!",0

Still, we were here a good two hours waiting on seating and food.",0
2041,"Title: Happy Hour Highlight, But Cuisine Falls Flat at Obao

After years of passing by Obao on my daily commute, I finally decided to give it a try during a happy hour rendezvous with friends. The service was the highlight of the night; the staff were exceptionally welcoming and went above and beyond to accommodate our group.

While the steamed dumplings were a delightful start, the remainder of the menu items we sampled failed to make a lasting impression. They were lackluster and left us wishing for more of the culinary adventure we had anticipated.

However, Obao did deliver on the happy hour experience with some fantastic drink deals, which, paired with the low crowd level, made for a relaxed and budget-friendly outing. If I were to return, it would be for the happy hour specials, rather than a food-centric experience.",1
12589,"Title: A Mixed Dining Experience at a Trendy Spot

Upon first impression, the restaurant's dimly-lit ambiance set a cool tone for our dinner, though the interior was surprisingly more compact than its external façade led us to believe.

The meal kicked off on a high note with the appetizers - the standout being the tender octopus paired with bacon and a delightful potato cheese foam. However, the portions left us wanting more. The chicken liver mousse was a flavorful journey, but its companion, the too-light milk bread, fell flat and failed to complement the dish.

Our main course, the ""Pig Out,"" unfortunately shifted the night's trajectory. Aiming to be the star, it presented itself quite differently from advertised. Instead of the anticipated crispy pork, we were met with greasy pulled pork topped with a crunchy layer - a combination that proved too rich and heavy to finish, and overly salted at that. The spicy peanut noodles accompanying the pork clashed rather than harmonized, their texture inconsistently cooked.

In summary, while the appetizers nearly soared to a 4-star delight, the main course's shortcomings pulled the overall experience down to a 3-star outing. With such potential in the starters, it's a dining spot that could shine with some tweaks to the heavier dishes that currently tip the scales away from culinary balance.",1
1275,"My friend and I came here for brunch a few weeks ago. We got there around 1:30pm on a Sunday and were able to get a table for 2 outside (without a wait) to enjoy the good weather. We shared a side of the potato pancake and it was so good. (Might get one for myself next time!) We also both got the Norwegian eggs Benedict, which sounded especially appealing because it was served on zucchini cake. The salmon was fresh and I enjoyed it a lot with the zucchini cake.

My friend and I decided to split the bone marrow, which was really good. The bone marrow comes with this jam and fantastic toast, and when you combine all three together, it's magic. The service is pretty fantastic too! Will definitely have to stop by again and try some of the other items.",0
15416,"I recently visited a noteworthy ramen shop that truly lived up to the hype and is a gem for any ramen lover. Upon entry, the lively greeting is part of the charm that sets the tone for an authentic experience. The Ippudo Pork Buns were a delectable start, and the Shishito peppers offered a tasty alternative to the common appetizer of Edamame, zesty with just the right amount of salt.

The main event was their Shin TanTan-Men ramen, touted as their spiciest option. It delivered on the promised heat, but with an unexpected sweet undertone that balanced the flavors beautifully. It was a deliciously fiery challenge that had me sweating but satisfied, finishing the entirety of the rich broth. A word to the wise: it's not for the faint-hearted, so brace yourself for the aftermath.

For those who appreciate a good brew, the Oze No Yukidoke IPA is an excellent pairing to complement the robust flavors of the meal. It's a spot I would happily recommend and one I'll certainly revisit for more culinary adventures.",1

16233,"Title: Stylish Dining with a Side of Misses at Mokum

Review:
My evening at Mokum presented a mixed bag in an undoubtedly stylish setting. The restaurant exudes a modern chic with its sleek brass finishes and mid-century modern flair. The menu, while not extensive, offers a thoughtful balance of vegetarian and carnivorous options. The service started on a high note with an offer to check coats, a considerate touch for a fine dining experience.

I was intrigued by the tasting menu, though I opted out on this occasion – a decision I might revisit on a future visit. Where Mokum truly shines, though, is its cocktail repertoire. The Mokum old fashioned, a sherry and coffee liqueur concoction, provided an eclectic twist on a classic with unexpected cola notes – a delightful surprise.

As for the culinary offerings, the tuna tartare left much to be desired, being predominantly guacamole with too little tuna to justify the name. Conversely, the curried cauliflower shone brightly with its rich flavors and the clever addition of pomegranate seeds.

A minor, yet notable service oversight occurred as we were seated at the bar and inadvertently excluded from the bread service that table-seated guests enjoyed. Missing out on what could have been a sample of sumptuous homemade bread was a small disappointmen.

In summary, Mokum offers an atmosphere and drinks that promise a memorable evening, though some aspects of food and service could use finessing to elevate the overall experience to the level suggested by its sophisticated ambiance.",1
14453,"My friend and I got braised pork ribs soup noodles and pork liver & pepper dry noodles to share. I thought the braised pork ribs soup noodles was alright -- the soup was not as flavorful as I expected and overall it tasted a bit bland. However, I really liked the pork liver & pepper dry noodles. It was tasty and the meat was well seasoned!I would come back here to try their dumplings next time because I saw them making it in the kitchen. This place still stands as a good spot for fast casual and reasonably priced Chinese food though. The restaurant is pretty spacious and clean, and the staffs were very friendly!",0
19283,"My dining experience at this restaurant was underwhelming despite opting for the ""Trust Me"" dinner course. Although the fish served was undoubtedly fresh, it was overshadowed by an overuse of sauce, which leaned heavily towards the sour side, detracting from the natural flavors. Additionally, the sushi suffered from structural issues – the rice, while pleasantly fluffy, failed to hold together, complicating the process of actually picking up each piece. The presentation was also disappointing; dishes were lackluster in their arrangement, doing nothing to enhance the visual appeal or fill the empty space on the plates. Overall, the meal left much to be desired.",1
13121,"Without a doubt a must dine at dessert spot in NYC. For a mere $10.95, you can feast on a dessert like the Matcha Lava - warm dark chocolate cake filled with matcha ganache served a side of matcha ice cream on a bed of graham cracker. The perfect balance if you ask me, well, as balanced as dessert can be. Another whimsical, creative and interactive dessert from Chef Ian Kittichai.",0
16534,"My dining experience at this charming restaurant was a mix of hits and misses. The cute and cozy ambiance was slightly marred by initial confusion with a café front and separate restaurant seating. Service was prompt, which was a plus.

The extensive menu appeared promising, though prices were a notch above typical Shanghai eateries in Chinatown, piquing my curiosity about the food quality. The Fried Wontons were decent, adequately crispy but unremarkable. My encounter with the Marinated Jellyfish was less favorable due to its peculiar taste, though it seemed to be an acquired taste as my friend enjoyed it.

The real standout was the Traditional Shanghai Pan Fried Soup Dumplings—absolutely delectable and highly recommended. The Grandma's Pork Soup Dumplings were satisfactory, yet I've had superior ones elsewhere. Meanwhile, the Crab Roe Soup Dumplings delivered a more satisfying experience, outshining the pork version.

Our Dan Dan Noodles were enjoyable, but the accompanying duck disappointed with its excessive saltiness; I'd advise sticking with the noodles alone.

Presentation across the board was eye-catching, enhancing the dining experience. However, despite the aesthetic appeal, I find myself drawn towards the authentic flavors of my go-to Shanghai spots in Chinatown for a more gratifying meal at a lesser cost. At $25 per person including tax and tip, the overall value left something to be desired.",1

Or something of that sort and it was not in a good way.

17108,"Title: Delightful Eats, Yet Noisy & Pricey - A Visit to The Balthazar

I recently dined at The Balthazar and found it to be a mixed bag of experiences. The highlight is undoubtedly the food, which is exceptional. The bread they serve is a perfect symphony of textures—fluffy insides embraced by a satisfyingly crunchy crust. As for the main course, the mushroom risotto I chose stood out with its rich Parmesan sauce, making each bite a creamy delight.

However, there are a couple of caveats to keep in mind when visiting. Firstly, the noise level can be quite overwhelming, surpassing the usual bustling ambiance of French bistros. Those seeking a quiet dinner spot might find The Balthazar's din a bit too much. Additionally, the tables are rather closely packed, so privacy is limited; expect to overhear nearby chatter.

The service here deserves a nod—efficient and friendly, the waitstaff does an excellent job. Yet, when it comes to value, The Balthazar sits on the expensive side. It's also worth mentioning to be precise when ordering, as portion sizes can be generous, to the point of surprise; my ""big version"" risotto left more on my plate than anticipated.

In summary, for the quality of the food, The Balthazar gets a recommendation, but it's wise to come with a full wallet and a preparedness for the lively (read: loud) atmosphere.",1
14789,"Title: A Disappointing Experience at Beyond Sushi Midtown

Rating: ★★☆☆☆

I've been a loyal patron of Beyond Sushi since its inception, regularly visiting the original location with great satisfaction. Expecting the same standards, I recently tried their Midtown branch near my workplace, only to be met with a string of disappointments.

Upon arrival, I requested a carrot-free soup and a small taste to gauge the spiciness, which was initially denied until the manager intervened. Opting for the less spicy alternative, I took a seat, expecting dine-in service, but my soup was mistakenly packaged to-go. After a 15-minute wait and a reminder, I found my soup inundated with carrots despite my earlier request.

The staff provided me with a bowl and utensils after I pointed out the error, but the soup itself was disappointingly lukewarm. The utensils proved inadequate for the task, necessitating a sturdier replacement.

Unfortunately, the ordeal didn't end there. Shortly after my meal, I experienced severe food poisoning that left me ill for over a day. While the manager did apologize for the mishaps when I brought them to her attention, the risk of illness overshadows the potential of their vegan offerings.

In the interest of health and because of this regrettable experience, I've decided to discontinue patronizing Beyond Sushi. A real shame for a lifelong vegetarian eager to support vegan dining in NYC.",1
20505,"Tucked away beside the park I often pass is a hidden gem I only recently discovered alongside my coworkers. Upon our early arrival, we found the establishment desolate, an ideal setting for a peaceful lunch. Yet, as we delved into our shared cheese board—a delightful selection despite the sparse four slices of bread—the place burgeoned with patrons, signaling its local popularity.

I opted for the burger with a medium rare preference; it arrived more on the rare side, juices oozing. Despite this minor discrepancy, the flavors were commendable—a testament to the kitchen's prowess. Overall, it's a spot worth trying, especially if you beat the noon rush.",1

1934,"Title: A Delightful Dim Sum Experience at Golden Unicorn

I recently visited Golden Unicorn, and even if the only draw had been their adorable piggy buns, I would have been sold. Thankfully, the charm of this establishment extends well beyond the aesthetics; the dim sum here is exceptional.

The service follows the classic dim sum experience: carts roll around, allowing diners to choose their favorites as servers stamp a card to track orders. It’s easy to indulge given the variety, but beware of the wait times, especially on weekends, which can reach an hour. However, they do text when your table is ready, freeing you up to explore nearby Chinatown.

The interior boasts a gaudy charm with rich red velvet curtains and white tablecloths across its floors, creating an atmosphere that's both festive and traditional. Sharing tables with other small parties is common but just adds to the convivial ambiance.

Must-try dishes include the impossibly tender chicken feet, the pure shrimpy goodness of both the Shrimp Shu Mai and Crystal Shrimp Dumpling, and, of course, the piggy bun—adorable and delicious with its sweet, soft dough and creamy custard filling.

Golden Unicorn is perfect for dim sum newcomers and aficionados alike, offering a broad array of choices. Language barriers are a non-issue; non-Chinese speakers can easily point-and-choose or communicate in English.

In summary, Golden Unicorn is a must-visit for dim sum lovers in search of great food, a lively environment, and unique treats like their signature piggy bun.",1
11146,"More like 3.5 stars and I'd like to preface this review by stating I might not have dined at a Filipino restaurant before. Until now.Mama Fina was a suggestion from my friend and we had a very enjoyable experience. She had dined here before.When we arrived, I felt a bit displaced because the menu was staring at us on this huge chalkboard near the entrance. There was no initial table service. Huh you might asking? It meant that all ordering took place at the counter (slightly annoying) but was served to the table once ready.We decided to share two plates (for this visit, we passed on ordering the signature Filipino dish, Sisig, since it is supposedly deep fried in its entirety).Pork dominated the menu but there were enough options for those who do not eat pork or red meat (like me)The entrees we chose were Shrimp Gambas and BBQ Chicken (wings). The Shrimp was accompanied by white rice but for the BBQ Chicken, there was a choice of white, garlic or java rice (semi sweet).The restaurant was quite busy with, according to our observation, many Filipinos patronizing and enjoying their food. I think that's a positive indicator that the food can be good. The aroma was delicious throughout the entire restaurant. Along with our entrees, we also ordered a glass of wine each. The woman at the counter was kind to allow me to taste the white which I didn't particularly care for. We selected Pinot Noir and Malbec ($11).Once sat, our dinner arrived at a reasonable wait time and overall service was good. Water glasses always refilled quickly and staff was pleasant.The Shrimp Gambas fell under the sizzling category and was served in a small cast iron skillet.It included 6 shrimp, peppers, onions, egg, spices and was extremely flavorful. We opted for the spicy version. To our dismay, the portion was a bit small for the price point, $25. We devoured it in no time wishing we had more.The BBQ Chicken was a plate of 8 huge chicken wings and a generous side of java rice ($18). The portion was massive and quite shareable. The wings were perfectly cooked with a sweet/savory sauce that included peanut butter, slathered on them. The rice was amazing and a perfect accompaniment to the wings.We were too full for dessert but intend on returning.The décor, although clean, was a bit odd. Although it was decorated for Halloween, the general theme was lots of panel throughout the restaurant which emitted an odd stench especially downstairs where I used the restroom the first time. In other words, it appeared that the restaurant could use some renovations.I can't be sure if the entrees we chose were authentic Filipino cuisine but all I know is that my friend and I really enjoyed the food.I would not only recommend but would return.",0
2858,"I was in town for work and met up with some friends for dinner here. We've all heard so many great things about JeJu and had to try it out for ourselves. We arrived at around 7 and had to wait for about 45 minutes for our table because we didn't make reservations. To make the most out of our long wait time, we went on a quick 3 minute walk and visited the iconic apartment building that was used in the show Friends and checked out some of the shops nearby. You'd be surprised at how quickly 45 mins can fly by when there's so much to see. We were quickly seated when we came back and I ordered the Truffle Bibim Myun noodles. I don't know about you but I don't regularly have truffle noodles so I had no idea what I signed up for but for $38 a bowl, it had some expectations to live up to. First off, can we talk about the pearly box that the truffle is stored in? The box is a piece of artwork in itself! The truffle for the noodles is shaved table side and is quite the luxurious experience when you're only used to parmesan shavings. The truffle was so aromatic and it completely elevated the carbonara-like noodle dish. The dish itself was pure decadence. Noodles were perfectly cooked and had just the right chew to it. The sauce was very rich and creamy. While all the flavors worked wonderfully together, I must say, it can get a bit heavy. Would be great if shared amongst several people. I had a great experience at JeJu and would highly recommend it if you're looking to indulge in some yummy goodness.",0
11360,"Came here after going to an Ariana Grande concert, so it was around midnight and there was no one in the restaurant which was quite nice. Me and my boyfriend sat at the bar and ordered margaritas. Both frozen and on the rocks which were delicious! They were $10 each which is a little steep since they used small glasses. But we each had tacos and I tried the street tacos carne asada and it was amazing. Also had the kids quesadilla with chicken and cheese which was also very good! Awesome late night place for tacos near Chinatown! Our waiter/bartender was the only person working and he was good, he took our orders and the food came out quickly which is also a plus! Deff will be back if we are in the area looking for some good Mexican food",0
16519,"I picked this place as a special occasion dinner for a double date with friends who were visiting from out of town. As Cosme is ranked on the list of world's 50 best restaurants, we all had high expectations for dinner. Though we were 15 minutes late for our reservation, the staff were accommodating and seated us immediately. They brought us water and menus right after we were seated, and gave us ample time to order drinks and food. They recommended 2 dishes per person, so we decided on ordering 7: guacamole, crab infladita, taco al pastor, razor clam tostada, mole and their signature, the duck carnitas. The guacamole, crab infladita, al pastor tacos and the clam tostada were presented first as appetizers. The guacamole was good, but I couldn't distinguish between Cosme's high end guacamole and a cheaper version. The razor clam tostada was fresh, with an interesting sauce. My favorites of the starter dishes were the al pastor tacos with a pineapple sauce, that we wrapped ourselves, and the crab infladita. The crab infladita consisted of a shell pastry with crab and a spicy sauce on the interior. I'd heard great things about the duck carnitas, so we ordered that along with the mole. The mole was about $30, and I hadn't realised at the time of ordering, that it was a sauce and nothing else. I didn't see the value at all in paying $30 for sauce, and would not recommend ordering this at all. As their signature dish, we all had high hopes for the carnitas. When it arrived, we all dug in eagerly. Consensus was that it was good, but we all also thought the appetizers were better than the mains. Service was friendly, we didn't have any complaints in this department. The ambience here is modern, trendy and understated. Based on this experience, I don't feel the need to dine here again, but would recommend to others for an upscale Mexican dinner.",0
16531,"Title: A Slice of Heaven for Artichoke Aficionados

I recently had the pleasure of visiting Artichoke, and it’s safe to say their pizza is in a league of its own. Consistently delicious across various locations, this place is a must-try for artichoke enthusiasts. Their signature Artichoke Pizza is a creamy, cheesy delight; imagine the most luxurious artichoke dip lavished generously atop a perfectly crisp dough that holds up bravely under the weight.

These slices are colossal, making them ideal for sharing. Cut one in half, and you've got a splendid lunch to enjoy with a companion. The seating is sparse, so be prepared to grab your pizza to go - a minor inconvenience for such a sublime treat. I'm a devoted fan of Artichoke and will seize every chance I get to indulge in their unique and mouth-watering pizza.",1

14658,"Title: Mixed Feelings at a Neighborhood Gem

Having dined twice at this local spot, I am charmed by its ambiance and the striking Whitney Houston mural that anchors the decor, not to mention the collection of vibrant murals lining the walls. Sadly, the culinary experience hasn’t quite matched the visual appeal.

My latest visit was on a Thursday night to try the Melita Smith special—jerked shrimp. Unfortunately, the dish's promise of spice translated to an overwhelming and rather unenjoyable blast of black pepper. Accompanying sides of fried okra, mashed potatoes, and mac 'n cheese were satisfactory, yet none stood out as particularly memorable.

On an earlier occasion, I sampled the Lloyd Williams combo, pairing a boneless top sirloin steak with a waffle. The waffle was fairly standard, lacking any distinct flair. While the sirloin was generously portioned, it quickly revealed itself as undercooked and rubbery, resisting even my knife's edge.

However, not all was amiss—the banana pudding dessert shined brightly with its delightful flavor and generous portion, making it an easy choice for sharing and a must-try.

In conclusion, while the place certainly has its charm and a superb dessert offering, the main courses could benefit from more attention to flavor and cooking precision.",1
2972,"The restaurant delivers a satisfactory dining experience with flavorful dishes; however, caution to mealpal users as the portions provided under this deal are noticeably reduced—expect to receive about half of what would typically constitute a full serving.

14302,"Just had dinner there today and it was great! We had a big party about 10 of us. We did the reservation for the monofuku ssam and it's a huge dish that feeds 6-10 people but more on the 10 people side. It comes with lettuce wraps, kimchi, rice, Korean sauce, and ginger scallion sauce. We ordered the glitter punk drink and it had edible sparkles on the side of the cup. So aesthetically pleasing and it was good! We did order some appetizers and other stuff to feed our bellies but we were so full. We got the spicy rice cake with sausage and yes it was spicy but good with bite sized chewy ricecake. We got the Uni and scallop rice which was a small bowl but it was pretty good and a decent amount of Uni. We also got a few orders of steamed buns with the thick pork belly and we got brussel sprouts. The only part I found interesting was gratuity wasn't included in our bill which is rare for a party this size.",0
2721,"Rahi is a modern Indian restaurant in West Village from the team behind Queens hotspot Adda. Though reviews have been good, I was disappointed by my visit with my parents around Thanksgiving.The wine list is not too long; they're really more of a cocktail place. These are all pretty and strong, and though two were lovely, one came with so much chili that it was borderline undrinkable.On the food front, everything was more exciting on paper, and the plate, than in the mouth. We had five different dishes, and all were good but not great. More photogenic than flavorful. I think the mango cod was our favorite. Dahi chili paneer, chili crab ink, and spaghetti squash kofta were all okay. Edamame artichoke chaat didn't make much sense.Three smalls and two large were more than enough for our party of 3; I'd get two and two. Smalls are $15 - 23 and larges are $26 - 34. Naan is $5 extra. Menu is very accommodating for vegetarians and nut allergies. Note that nothing is very pricey.Service was reasonably attentive but not well trained... our waitress tried to sell one of the drink specials by solely saying ""uh, it's vodka-based"" and couldn't pronounce common Indian words, including naan.The space is very designed for Instagram; I liked the wall murals but overall it felt a bit sterile. Seating is plasticky and not very comfortable. You shouldn't have a problem with getting a reservation, and it wasn't too crowded when we went.I'm not sure what I'm missing here, but for me it was an expensive and unmemorable meal.",0
13630,"I was thrilled to find out that Roberta's has a new spot at UrbanSpace close to my workplace, especially since they've teamed up with MealPal to serve 8-inch personal pizzas. They’re not only delicious but also some of the best value you can get on the platform. Their Original and Bee Sting pizzas hit the mark with consistent taste, even with the increased volume for MealPal orders. The service is efficient – my pizza has been ready every time I've arrived. Given the fantastic quality, I expect this location to become a hotspot very soon. Highly recommend giving it a try!",1
11675,"Joe's may not serve up the best pizza in the Big Apple, but it's the epitome of the classic New York City slice experience. During my recent visit, I opted for both the pepperoni and the tomato/mozzarella slices. While I wished the tomato/mozzarella came to me a tad hotter, the pepperoni slice hit all the right notes – savory, satisfying, and spot-on with the flavors. Despite this minor inconsistency, Joe's usually delivers on the promise of a top-notch NYC slice.",1
2821,"My long-awaited visit to this new gem in Chinatown did not disappoint. The quaint eatery has a cozy setup with just two tables and a window bench, comfortably seating about 10-12 patrons, with most opting for takeout. The popularity was evident with a steady stream of customers pouring in since its 7 am opening.

The star attraction is undoubtedly the freshly-made rice noodle rolls, crafted right before your eyes using an electric-powered stone mill. There's an array of delicious fillings to choose from – I went for the dried shrimp and roast pork, and each bite was a delight; the noodles were exceptionally smooth and thin.

Tip: Don't miss out on their soybean drink–a steal at just $1. Although they tend to sell out of congee by noon, so an early visit is advisable. Open until 4 pm, this place is perfect for breakfast and lunch. The prices are very reasonable, and the warm, familial service adds to the charm. I've found my new staple for rice noodles, and I'm confident they're here to stay.",1
13740,"Came here last night with my boyfriend to celebrate both Valentine's Day and our four-year anniversary. We made a reservation for 6pm on a Friday night, and I'd recommend doing so because I saw people trying to walk in and getting rejected. There was a coat check at the entrance, so it was nice not having to sit with all our coats and bags. The service was lovely without being snobby. I was overwhelmed by all the different sushi dinner choices and couldn't really tell which one I should go for, so I asked the waitress for a recommendation. I told her that I liked sushi but not fish-fish and that I preferred non-fish like scallop, eel, and uni. She recommended the Pick 10: for $38 I could pick 10 pieces from the sushi list and a roll and dropped off a slip of paper which the choices that day. I could do two of the same piece if I wanted, but no more than two of the same piece. I chose two eel, two scallop, two uni, one botan ebi (shrimp), one salmon roe, one squid, and one octopus. The uni was one of the less good uni's I've had - there was a not-so-fresh fishy smell to it. Also the squid was very tough and hard to chew. Everything else was good though, although not spectacular. They gave us a complimentary ice cream mochi dessert (one piece mango, one piece matcha, one piece strawberry) because we told them we were celebrating our anniversary. It wasn't that good but I won't complain about something free. Also everyone gets complimentary after-meal hojicha tea, which is nice, because I always want tea after a meal! I probably wouldn't be back based on the quality of the sushi, especially because I live for uni and that was subpar. The experience hovers between three and four stars, but I'm rounding up because of the free dessert and overall good service.",0
10802,"Title: A Cozy Gem with Standout Flavors - Ronin Stones

My partner and I stumbled upon Ronin Stones, a charming new venue that beckoned us with its promise of good food and a cozy atmosphere. This eatery may appear small, but what it lacks in size, it more than makes up for in spotless cleanliness and a warm, inviting ambience, enhanced by an efficient heater and the inviting glow of an open grill.

Despite the close quarters, the space was perfect for our dinner for two. The staff struck the perfect balance between attentiveness and discretion, allowing us to relax and savor our meal without the usual pressure of hoveringly attentive servers.

Our taste buds were treated to an array of delectable dishes, each more delicious than the last. The edamame and Japanese-style potato salad set a high bar with their freshness and rich flavor profile. The grilled vegetable medley was perfectly charred, while the chicken gizzards and thigh skewers were delightfully tender and expertly cooked—a stark contrast to the often overdone counterparts elsewhere.

The true highlight, however, was the beef tongue stew draped in a luscious demi-glace sauce served over rice. Each bite was a revelation—tender meat that melted in the mouth, beautifully complemented by the robust sauce. Although the sauce's intensity may be a bit much for some, it was an absolute hit for me.

Ronin Stones has earned a top spot on our list, and we are eagerly anticipating our next visit. A must-try for anyone looking for a comfortably intimate dining experience paired with genuinely impressive culinary creations.",1
16566,"Title: Authentic Neapolitan Pizza at Ribalta

Upon entering Ribalta, near Union Square, you're greeted by an expansive, open white space adorned with touches of Italian charm. With its soaring ceilings and a variety of seating arrangements, including a more secluded bar area, the venue promises both comfort and style.

The star of the show is undoubtedly the Neapolitan pizza—a culinary gem that demands to be savored with a knife and fork, respecting its delicate form. True to tradition, the pizza here boasts a thin, tender dough that's a marked departure from the thicker, stiffer New York slices we're all used to. Ribalta's crust strikes the ideal balance, achieving a light charring without sacrificing its soft, pillowy texture. Each bite is complemented by a sauce that's vibrant yet restrained and crowned with the freshest of mozzarella.

Ribalta serves up a genuine slice of Naples at a price that doesn't compromise on value. For an authentic Italian experience that's kind on the wallet, Ribalta earns a resounding 'Bravo!'",1
13407,"Venturing into Nakamura for a bowl of ramen turned out to be a delightful experience. The star of the meal, the Tontoro ramen, boasted a deep rich pork broth that enveloped the palate, complemented by chewy thick noodles that provided a satisfying texture. The addition of smoky chicken was a stroke of genius, creating a harmonious blend of flavors and textures.

On the side, the shiso truffle fries caught our attention. While they were tasty and unique, they were crying out for a dip. In a surprising twist, Nakamura doesn't stock ketchup, but a helpful server provided an alternative—a concoction of soy sauce and chili paste that added an unexpected but welcome zing.

My one critique would be the chashu; it fell short of expectations, lacking that sought-after 'melt in your mouth' sensation. However, this minor letdown was quickly forgiven, thanks to the jidori chicken which compensated by shining as the protein highlight.

On the whole, Nakamura earns a solid 4 stars for their comforting bowl of ramen and creative accompaniments, despite a few hiccups along the way.",1
21118,"This spot is hella POSH. I love it. This restaurant is spacious, quiet and decor is very ""NY."" our waiter was polite and accommodating. He answered our questions regarding the me I and made some excellent recommendations. This is definitely a place you go to for date night or a brunch date with a significant other. I was very happy to have the opportunity to come and eat at this restaurant. Parking was pretty good as well since we went on a Sunday. I will definitely want to come back and eat here again.",0
10513,"Title: Cozy Culinary Charm at Le French Diner

Le French Diner is a hidden gem nestled in the Lower East Side, offering a hearty French fare that captures the essence of a quaint Parisian bistro. While my practical side awards it a 4 out of 5, the charm it exudes tugs at my heartstrings for that perfect 5.

The menu features staples like a generous and flavorful, albeit slightly oversalted, hanger steak accompanied by decadent potato gratin squares. The escargot tantalizes the taste buds, served in a lavish pool of butter, while the duck confit strikes a balance between succulent and crisp, resting on a bed of well-seasoned kale.

This nook isn't for the health-conscious, starting with its indulgent pre-meal cheese plates, an essential appetizer as you may find yourself waiting for your meal amidst the snug, bustling atmosphere. With a capacity of only 15, it's wise to nibble on something while sipping on their thoughtful selection of wines by the glass, priced between $11 and $15, or explore the concise bottle list.

Service is a standout, with attentive and knowledgeable staff ensuring a warm dining experience. The ambiance is the real draw – intimate, candlelit, and energetic with an impeccable music selection adding to its allure. While the offerings are limited and infrequently rotated, there's a sense of discovering an exclusive spot, thanks in part to recent buzz.

Prices lean towards the higher end – expect to spend around $60 for a well-rounded meal and drink – but it's well justified by the quality and the overall experience. For an ideal visit, arrive as a pair or with up to three companions, and aim to get there by 7 pm to beat the crowd.

In summary, Le French Diner is where you go to savor both the food and the moment, perfect for a romantic evening or a catch-up with close friends. Just remember to embrace the cozy quarters and the possibility of a wait – it's all part of the charm.",1
13783,"Title: A Royal Treat with a Side of Patience at Thai Villa

Walking into Thai Villa feels like being whisked away to a regal retreat; its stunning interior design and mood lighting create a mini-palace ambiance that captivates immediately. The staff upholds this high standard of charm with their friendliness and attentiveness, particularly when navigating their diverse menu.

Unfortunately, the experience is marred somewhat by the excessive wait times; a near three-hour wait for a table is a steep price to pay, even with delectable offerings awaiting. The inconvenience is doubled when considering their party size limitation; groups larger than seven must splinter, which detracts from a communal dining experience.

Once seated, however, the flavors of Thai Villa do not disappoint. The cuisine shines brighter than your average Thai eatery in NYC, albeit with a matching price tag. Starters like the spring rolls are passable, but it's the entrees where Thai Villa truly excels. The Pad Kee Mao zings with spice, customizable to your tolerance, though still packs heat. While the noodle to meat ratio could favor the former, this is a minor quibble in an otherwise delightful dish.

Variety is a strong suit, with Thai Villa's curries and Pad Thai also winning approval, particularly the Pad Thai's sweeter notes – a pleasant deviation from the norm. Despite the challenges, Thai Villa’s culinary delights warrant a visit. To mitigate the wait, aim for opening hours or leverage the Yelp waitlist.

Be mindful of their 20% automatic gratuity for larger parties; Thai Villa is best approached with some planning. It’s a spot worth recommending for its top-tier flavors – a one-time visit feels essential, if only to taste how Thai cuisine can border on artistry.",1
17002,"Title: A Noodle Delight in the East Village!

Just dined at this new spot in the East Village boasting a simple, yet delectable menu centered around handpulled noodles that are absolutely yummy. Their headliner, the big tray chicken, is a must-try - perfectly seasoned and cooked to perfection, although be warned, it's a tad heavy on the chicken compared to the noodles. Don't miss out on the stewed lamb; it's tender and juicy. Also, the eggplant potato side is a surprising hit - do give it a try. Overall, this place is a fantastic addition to the neighborhood's food scene.",1
15444,"I recently visited a spot for lunch that serves a delightful pork and duck over rice, portioned just right for a mere $5. To elevate the meal, I recommend grabbing a boba from Kung Fu or Panda Cafe close by. My experience on a sunny winter Sunday around noon was pleasant, with a manageable queue. A heads up—it's a cash-only establishment. I thoroughly enjoyed the experience and definitely plan to return.",1
10214,"Title: A Solo Lunch Experience at [Restaurant Name]

I recently dined alone at [Restaurant Name] for lunch and my experience was a mixed bag. I ordered the filet ol' fish, chilled corn soup, and a Matcha Jones to drink. While none of the dishes were outright disappointing, they fell short of remarkable.

The Matcha Jones was an intriguing concept blending matcha with coconut water, but it failed to deliver on the promised mint notes, leaving the drink somewhat one-dimensional. The filet o' fish featured a well-balanced bun to sauce to fish ratio, with flaky, tender fish, but the tartare sauce had an overabundance of capers that tipped the scales towards too salty.

The chilled corn soup was where I set high hopes, being a soup aficionado. Although the texture was creamy and the heirloom tomato and corn pudding at the center was custardy and pleasant, the tomato presence overwhelmed the soup. This resulted in the natural sweetness of the corn being overshadowed, making it taste more like a tomato salad than a corn soup.

Despite the underwhelming meal, I am willing to give [Restaurant Name] another chance to win me over, particularly with their tuna carpaccio and salmon crudo on my radar for the next visit.",1
3049,"Title: A Dim Sum Delight near Rockefeller University

I recently had the pleasure of dining at a local dim sum spot while on a trip to Rockefeller University with a colleague, and it was a culinary revelation. Guided by the trustworthy recommendations of fellow Yelpers, we found ourselves in a bustling eatery that seemed to be a lunchtime favorite, even on a random Thursday in January.

The variety of dishes we tried, thanks to my coworker's adept ordering in Chinese, was outstanding. From soup dumplings that burst with flavor to perfectly steamed and crispy fried iterations, each dumpling was a bite of heaven. But it wasn't just the dumplings that shone; the sautéed pea shoots were unlike any I've had before — simply the best.

We left the restaurant stuffed and immensely satisfied, our craving for authentic dim sum thoroughly met. This place is a must-visit for any dim sum aficionado or anyone looking for a delicious culinary experience. I'm already looking forward to my next visit!",1
2883,"Don't understand the reviews under 4-5 stars on here. The place was amazing. The service was friendly and efficient, the ramen was delicious and the music they had in the background was on point. Started off with the Tongue-katsu sando, never thought I'd enjoy eating beef tongue. We ordered the Tokyo Shio and the chicken paitan ramen. My bf couldn't stop talking about the chicken Paitan after leaving. The broth was very flavorful. This place set the bar for ramen pretty high. I'd move to this neighborhood just so I could become a regular at this place. Also, this chef (Ivan) was featured on an ep of Chef's Table; it was pretty cool learning his background before coming. He makes his noodles from scratch and puts his own spin on it which is why they aren't stereotypical ramen noodles.",0

17571,"Title: Soba Haven at Ise with a Side of Elegance

My visit to Ise wasn't initially for sushi cravings, but rather the intriguing soba variety they boasted on their menu. It's rare to find a place that serves an extensive range of soba noodles, which made Ise an exciting discovery. The restaurant's clean, minimalist interior was welcoming, and despite the crowd, they managed to seat our large group without a hitch.

Diving into the appetizer menu felt a bit like navigating a maze due to its sheer size. Although diverse, the appetizers came in portions that seemed more suited for individuals rather than a group eager to share, considering the price. That said, the soba selection was impressive, offering a delightful mix of hot and cold dishes. The noodles were a textural dream – perfectly chewy and not the slightest bit soggy, cooked just right to deliver that authentic soba experience. We appreciated the diverse soup and sauce options that accompanied them. A thoughtful touch was the broth provided at meal's end, allowing us to savor the last of our exquisite sauces.

The service at Ise deserves a special mention. The staff were incredibly accommodating, maintaining their friendly demeanor throughout our visit, which only enhanced the dining experience. For soba enthusiasts and those looking to share a variety of dishes, Ise is a spot worth checking out – just be mindful of the appetizer portions if you're in a sharing mood.",1
16788,"Title: Mixed Feelings About Happy Hour

I recently visited this Mexican restaurant for happy hour, eager for some delicious apps and drinks. Unfortunately, the appetizer selection left much to be desired, particularly for vegetarians. The lack of options like nachos or a vegetarian-friendly shared platter was a letdown for my colleagues and myself. We ended up snacking on the complimentary chips and salsa, which, while tasty, didn't satisfy my craving for something cheesier.

On the upside, the drinks did not disappoint. The margaritas were particularly noteworthy – both the frozen and on-the-rocks versions packed the perfect punch. The beer selection was also commendable and added a nice touch to the offerings. 

The service was quite attentive. Our server made frequent rounds and was quick to fulfill our requests, although there was a slight hiccup with a forgotten order. The space itself was on the smaller side, but it offered a cozy and inviting ambiance that made up for the lack of elbow room.

I urge the restaurant to consider expanding their happy hour menu to include more vegetarian options and some classic cheesy bar food. Despite the menu limitations, I am hopeful about returning, especially for another one of those fantastic margaritas.",1
18501,"Sweet little Italian spot in SoHo, and I do mean little. I for one did not mind the cozy vibe, and the waiters were all amazing. Food was also excellent - my boyfriend and I shared the eggplant parm to start, then shared the Tagliatelle with ragu (standout) and Taglierini with squid ink (also great) and cannoli for dessert (cannolis plural, really, as you get three minis). Bonus points for the cannoli having cocoa powder instead of powdered sugar. I've walked by this place a million times - so glad I finally tried it.",0
2130,"Title: Disappointing Omomokase Experience at a New Spot

Last Wednesday, a friend and I decided to try the Omomokase at a newly opened sushi restaurant, which, surprisingly, had readily available reservations. Their Omomokase, exclusive to the sushi counter, promised 16 premium pieces, an appetizer, and dessert for $140. However, discrepancy arose when we only received 12 pieces.

Starting with an underwhelming edamame appetizer, the meal took an age to begin. Once underway, the experience faltered. Although the fish quality was acceptable, the service was disjointed, with overloaded chefs distributing sushi two pieces at a time, causing some to linger and lose their freshness. The colder, tougher rice further marred the experience.

A few dishes stood out, such as the negitori with truffle and caviar, while others like the bland albacore and lackluster Maine Uni failed to impress. The concluding dessert, featuring a forgettable cheesecake and subtly flavored black sesame ice cream, did little to redeem the meal.

It was only upon receiving the bill that we confronted the staff about the discrepancy from the advertised 16 pieces, and to their credit, they were apologetic and offered a 25% discount. While this mistake might be rectified now, it certainly raised concerns about potential overcharges for unsuspecting diners.

In summary, I cannot recommend the Omomokase at this establishment. The service needs refinement, and patrons may find a better experience away from the counter with the sushi sets or izakaya offerings. The modern and stylish ambiance does make for an appealing venue for small groups, but as for the food, I'm content with this visit being my last.",1
17344,"Title: A Cozy Brunch with a Side of Laughter

Rating: ★★★½

Our dining experience was cozy and enjoyable, with food that nestled comfortably in the realm of ""good"" but didn't leap into the extraordinary. The unlimited mimosa and bellini option was a delightful touch, although the drinks themselves were nothing to write home about.

What truly stood out was the service—specifically, our waiter, whose vibrant personality transformed our brunch from a simple meal into an entertaining escapade. Despite the slower pace of service, his charm compensated for the wait, ensuring that the leisurely flow of our meal suited our unhurried mood perfectly.

The atmosphere of the restaurant struck a pleasant balance between relaxed and inviting, with enough space to avoid feeling crowded. It isn't the place for those seeking grandeur, but if comfort is what you're after, this spot hits the mark. All in all, it was a cheerful rendezvous point that catered to our need for a laid-back and fun dining experience.",1
19397,"Title: Cozy Dinner at Carmine's - A NYC Gem for Group Dining

I recently visited Carmine's when the Times Square location was fully booked, and I'm happy to report that their alternative spot did not disappoint. The reservation system is efficient; they firmly hold your table but make sure to arrive within the 15-minute grace period they provide. 

Our group of four was seated immediately at 5:00 PM on a bustling Saturday. Carmine's truly shines with larger parties that allow for a more diverse selection of their family-style servings. We opted for a relatively light meal, choosing shrimp parmigiana and meatballs with linguini. The shrimp was outstanding, and the linguini al dente – cooked to perfection. While the meatballs were well-textured, they were a tad on the bland side, which was the only minor letdown of the evening. 

Despite smaller appetites at our table, there was more than enough food to go around. The bill came to an impressive $108 for four people, including drinks, tax, and a 20% tip – a real steal in New York City. 

To top it all off, the service was nothing short of excellent, reinforcing why Carmine's remains a perennial favorite of mine. Whether for larger gatherings or a modest group, this restaurant is a solid choice for anyone craving Italian fare in the heart of the city.",1
19239,"Tucked away near Elizabeth Street Gardens, I stumbled upon an eclectic little gem of a restaurant. The decor transported me to a 'Stranger Things' set, complete with vintage wallpaper, an antique cashier register, and an almost hidden, shed-like bathroom at the rear. 

The lunchtime crowd filled the cozy space, adding a lively buzz. I opted for a hot chocolate to go, reasonably priced at $4. The service, unfortunately, left something to be desired; the bartender exuded a distant demeanor, with minimal interaction beyond the necessary transaction.

Seating at the bar felt cramped and slightly uncomfortable, a testament to the restaurant's compact size. Despite these drawbacks, the place charmed with its distinct personality and flair. A quaint spot that's worth a visit, if not for the warm service, then for its unique character.",1

I've tried their vodka pie as well as the famed tie dye pizza, and there is simply nothing better. The slices aren't thick so I don't feel too gross after eatIng a couple, but the flavor and texture definitely pop out! I will say, my favorite dish here is definitely the cacio e pepe. The pastas are made in house and you can tell the quality and freshness upon first bite. Everything is brought out super quickly, and the servers are super friendly!Definitely be sure to try their wines as well, they really complete the meal!",0
18320,This restaurant has a very modern vibe with mirrors and lots of light and black fixtures. I came here for lunch with a reservation for 3.  We were celebrating a birthday. The restaurant was very accommodating for the birthday. I had the lunch special with an appetizer and an entree. The butternut squash soup was excellent. It was very creamy and the sage was a great topping.  I then had the branzino which was cooked well. I would like to come again but have had trouble getting another reservation!,0
1295,"My recent visit to Fogo de Chao was nothing short of exceptional. Situated in a remarkably grand space, the restaurant immediately sets a tone of upscale dining. Service shone brightly throughout the evening, with special commendation deserved by Andrew, the attentive liquor cart attendant. His expert knowledge and his offer of an extensive collection of scotches, well beyond what the menu listed, was a delightful surprise.

The salad bar was a feast in itself, boasting an impressive array of fresh options that are perfectly designed to complement the all-you-can-eat meat experience. As servers circulated with a continuous parade of succulent cuts, the novelty of this dining concept truly added to the excitement of the meal.

While the experience does come at a premium—our party of five invested $700—the combination of attentive service, a sumptuous and varied food selection, and the unique dining format, all contribute to a sense of occasion that might just justify the splurge for those special outings.",1
16517,"This Turkish restaurant was near to our hotel. It's fast casual in the sense that you order and pay at the cashier and are given a number. When your number is called you pick up your food. You can get it to go it to eat in. The restaurant was originally established in Brooklyn in 2000. Their ""story"" goes back generations when the grandfather had a local eatery in Urfa, Turkey. The grandfather, Mehmet, was known also as ""Memo"". There is a counter against the window and a communal high top table running down the middle of the restaurant.Everything smelled so good when we entered that we ordered a bit more than we could eat. We started with a small order of hummus which came with a piece of Turkish bread (similar to, but thicker than regular pita). As all our food came out at the same time, and I used some of the hummus to add to my sandwich. I had a ""Memo shish kebab"" sandwich. This version has smaller pieces of grilled lamb in it. It also had lettuce, tomato and cabbage on it. (I opted for no onions). I got it on Turkish bread. You can also order it on pita or as a wrap. The sandwich was so large I ate it with a fork and knife. They nicely also gave us some sumac on request. The counters have salt and pepper and a Turkish form of slightly ground hot red peppers to add as well. My husband had their lamb Adana Kebab sandwich. The meat is chopped and seasoned in a long skewer shape. It also came with lettuce, onions, cabbage, and tomatoes. To drink, we had Turkish tea. Even the small size was large. They also have juices, Turkish sodas, a yogurt drink, and regular sodas, water, etc. The menu contains salads, soups, cold appetizers, hot appetizers, entrees, and even seafood as well as desserts. In the morning, they serve breakfast until 10:30 am including some various Turkish pastries -- pies, rolls, croissants, etc., as well as eggs. I'd definitely come back when in the area.

I recently visited a unique spot in NYC at the recommendation of some local friends, aiming to find something you can't replicate in Seattle. We arrived at opening time and not a moment too soon – the place filled up rapidly, a testament to its popularity.

The extensive menu was almost daunting, but the helpful images made decision-making a breeze. Pricing was refreshingly affordable, encouraging us to order a variety of dishes family-style and sample widely – a decision that paid off with every delicious bite.

A word to the wise: the décor features some bold imagery that might not be everyone's cup of tea, but if you don’t mind a bit of edge with your dining experience, it adds to the charm. This place is perfect for a group looking to eat well, enjoy some drinks, and revel in good company.",1

19857,"I honestly really wanted to love Kingston. The whole vibe and energy was great when I walked in. The restaurant was practically empty so I figured I'd treat myself to dinner and sit by the bar. Boy was I wrong! I decided to order the jerk shrimp salad. With barely anyone dining in the restaurant (see photo of empty tables) I thought this would be a quick option. 15 minutes pass, no salad-- ok cool. 20 minutes pass, no salad -- fine. 30 minutes pass, still no salad -- now I'm hangry! 40 minutes pass, still no salad -- WTH! After 40 minutes, my salad is ready, but they put it to go, when I was clearly dining in. Finally, I receive my food, and after 2 bites I find a fly in my meal! Also, my salad didn't have tomatoes, and when I asked the bartender, she responded they actually don't use tomatoes at all in the restaurant. So why was it listed as an ingredient in the salad on the menu?? (See menu photo) When I told her it was on the menu, she responded ""oh sh*t""I really have a hard time trying to understand how a basic salad took 40 minutes to cook when the entire dining room was empty when I arrived. Granted, the bartender who assisted me was sweet, but didn't even offer to re-make the order. So now I just wasted 50 minutes of my time, and forced to go elsewhere to find something to eat.I was so done after this. Moral of the story, don't waste your time here.

To bypass the dreaded wait, a quick call ahead to join the waitlist is advisable. Once seated, begin with the crepe dumplings, a delightful mix of textures and tastes that promise to whet your appetite, especially when paired with an aromatic Lychee Thai Iced Tea.

The chef's specialties shine with the crispy duck selections—we indulged in the duck salad and duck prig pao, both under $20. The duck itself is superb, but what takes the experience over the top are the accompanying ingredients that create a symphony of sweet, herbal, and tangy flavors in every forkful.

Up Thai presents a fresh perspective on Thai cuisine, characterized by its vibrant flavors and skillfully crafted dishes that stand out among NYC’s culinary landscape. It's a feast for both the palate and the wallet, and a place that should unquestionably be marked on any food aficionado's map.",1
16537,"Title: A Vegan Delight Even Non-Vegans Will Love

I've been a patron of this gem long before embracing veganism, and it has always been a hit with friends, especially for its stunning desserts. Dropping by recently with a friend, I was thrilled to find an expanded array of vegan options that didn't skimp on flavor.

Take note, the regular cones may not be vegan-friendly, but their gluten-free alternative certainly is. Vegan choices are well-marked, particularly the sorbets, so there's no guesswork involved. You also get to sample the sorbets before committing to your ""flower"" – a playful and visually appealing way to serve up your chosen scoops. The texture is incredibly creamy, rivaling traditional ice cream, and the mango and strawberry flavors not only taste divine but also create a vibrant visual feast.

Whether you're looking to cool off on a sweltering summer day or indulge in a bit of sweetness during cooler weather, this spot is a prime choice for anyone seeking a delicious vegan treat.",1
2859,"Mamoun's Falafel is in the name but if you can't guess what it is let's just say they sell supposedly the best falafel in NYC. Came here late night to try a bite and see what the hype was all about. Overall I thought the falafel was just alright. Maybe I'm just not a falafel type of girl but I thought the inside was a little bit dry. The flavor of the sandwich to me wasn't very flavorful like I thought it would be. To me this just tasted very plain and simple with light ingredients. But maybe people will enjoy this style more, I'm not sure but to me this place was alright but nothing amazing. Still worth a try though!!",0
1002,"Title: A Reliable Favorite with Top-Notch Meats

Four years since my first visit, and my latest experience at this gem of a restaurant proved that some things just get better with time, while others don't need to change at all. Service remains reliably swift and courteous, and the star of the show—the food—continues to impress with its high quality.

The menu may be concise, with a somewhat limited selection of beverages—mostly overshadowed by the splendid variety of meats that are, without exception, succulent and flavorful. While prices lean toward the higher end, the meat combo for two generously satisfied our table of four, with enough appetite spared for dessert elsewhere.

Trying to snag a table at 6 PM on a Tuesday, we braced for a long wait, only to be pleasantly surprised by a brief five-minute delay. To beat the crowds, aim for off-peak hours.

Service is attentive; no sooner had we ordered our meats than a server was at the table, cooking and expertly snipping them into bite-sized pieces, allowing us to savor each morsel at leisure. Yet, watch out for the additional charges like the $2 extra for a small bowl of rice—it adds up.

The meat package comes with a choice of stew—we chose the kimchi stew. A perfect companion on a chilly evening, it was spicy and filled with hearty chunks of pork.

To wash it all down, a shared pitcher of Hite beer was more than adequate. It's a straightforward Korean lager that pairs well with the robust flavors on offer. 

In summary, this eatery remains a steadfast choice for a sublime meal, despite its minimalistic menu and drink list. It's all about the meat here, and they serve it up just right.",1
19216,"On my return visit to Tre Sorelle, the lunch special won me over, marking a notable improvement. The chicken was served hot and had a perfect crispy exterior, complemented by a bed of fresh arugula salad with just the right touch of dressing. The baked ziti, though not made with fresh pasta, was satisfyingly cheesy and served piping hot. I couldn't help but notice the pizza, which looked tantalizing—I'm already planning a trip back to give it a taste. Tre Sorelle has certainly redeemed itself in my eyes.",1
10341,"Title: Group-Friendly Korean Eatery with Stellar Service

I recently dined at a Korean restaurant that managed our large party of 13 impressively, thanks to our sweet and attentive waitress. She was the highlight of our evening, even graciously snapping photos for us. The decor is standard, marked by a unique shelf of assorted sojus and a captivating painting of a man with striking cheekbones.

The cuisine was standard Korean fare. While not outstanding, the dishes were satisfying. The fried chicken glazed with honey garlic stood out the most—definitely a must-try. Portion sizes and variety were gratifying, leaving us content.

The real surprise came with the bill—each person only paid about $15, which is quite the feat for the quantity of food we enjoyed. While the restaurant might not be at the top of my favorites, it's worth a visit for the service and value alone.",1
20532,"Super tasty, not freshly made as in made to order but the margarita slice I did have was so tasty (they heat them up in the oven). Also ordered garlic knots that were basically a cinnamon roll but savory and amazing. I would eat this again and again, I do recall them delivering based on the worker taking orders on the phone, I'm not from NYC but I would come back if in the neighborhood.",0
3037,"I recently visited a charming little restaurant that caught my attention with its enticing happy hour offerings, lasting until 7 pm—margaritas for just $6.50, which is a steal. I couldn't resist the crispy fish taco and I must say, it was a delightful choice – both flavorful and satisfying. Highly recommended! My companion opted for the tuna fish ceviche tostada and was thoroughly impressed with the freshness and taste.

As a connoisseur of Mexican street corn, I decided to share a corn on the cob with the table. While it was enjoyable, it didn't quite hit the mark for the best I've ever had. However, my friend's chicken avocado romaine lettuce boat was a showstopper—beautifully presented with the right amount of spice to jazz it up, without being overwhelming. She insisted it's a must-try.

Overall, this place is a gem for anyone craving some quality Mexican fare at reasonable prices. With a convivial atmosphere and dishes that generally impress, I'd say it's well worth a visit.",1
13980,"Have been wanting to come here because of reviews and the hype. If I could give them 3.5 stars I would.Ambiance: pretty; but not as formal as I expected and not as ""holiday decorated"" either, as I anticipated: maybe I didn't see the right areas? They talk about the 'THE' Plaza Hotel during Christmas in NYC- aside from one tree.. what else?Food/price: pretty tasty, but I've had better or similar in Miami for a lesser price. We spent $270 on 2 drinks, an appetizer, and 2 entrees, I'd say it was worth a solid $170.Service: though we did arrive late for our reservation, we felt rushed through dinner & I'm a big snob for service.We had trouble finding it since there are like 3 plaza hotels within the same area, that was frustrating since we're not from NY.I may not return here unless it's booked for me on a particular occasion. Hope you have better luck.",0
3036,"Manting is undoubtedly a hidden gem with a vast menu of entrees and lunch specials. However, the standout feature is their dry pot, a signature must-try. At $11/lb for vegetables and $13/lb for meat, the value is extraordinary. The interactive experience at the counter allows for a custom creation; my pot with bean sprouts, seaweed, cabbage, bok choy, broccoli, beef, lamb, and fish was delectable, especially at a medium spice level that hit just the right note. They also offer a selection of sauces for additional flavoring. I'd advise starting with a milder spice level as you can always kick it up a notch later. The restaurant itself is clean, spacious, and well-lit, complemented by friendly staff and prompt service. Manting is a place I would frequent if it were closer to my workplace. A hearty thank you to them for a delightful dining experience.",1
21108,"This is my second visit to Casa Nonna, and I have officially made this restaurant my team's go-to dinner spot! Came here for a business dinner with my team a month ago, and everyone enjoyed it so much we came right back! I am happy to report that everyone left satisfied and very full! My company recently moved near Hudson Yards and most of my colleagues live in New Jersey, so one of the biggest requests made was for the restaurant to be near Port Authority. Casa Nonna is located about 10-15 minutes from Hudson Yards, and is about a 5-8 minute walk to Port Authority. It's between 8th and 9th Ave, so it is slightly removed from the crazy traffic of people around Port Authority. Besides the convenient location, the food is amazing, service is very attentive and super friendly. Our waiter was the best, we called him the Brazilian Rodrigo, because there are 2 Rodrigos lol the ambiance was lively, great for team dinners, or large groups. One of my colleagues is vegan and they were very accommodating to our special requests. We ordered a few dishes and requested for the cheese on the side so our colleague could try their wonderful dishes and they were more than happy to accommodate. We ordered their calamari, bruschetta spread, and a salad to start. I'll have to say their bruschetta was REALLY good, especially the eggplant one. I'd pass on the chicken liver option next time though. It wasn't my favorite honestly. I ordered the seared sea scallops with risotto as my main. It was delicious, but the portion was quite small for the price. Next time, I'd pass on this dish and order something else. My coworker had their breaded chicken Parm, she gave me some to try and it was SO good!! We had a bunch of desserts as well. My favorite was their cheese cake with vanilla ice cream. Overall, it was a great experience, my team left happy and we can't wait to come back!",0
12034,"Amma will fulfill any Indian food cravings! I especially love the lunch deals here - it's around $12-13 for a main dish, side, rice, and naan.

240,"Title: A Diner That Truly Delivers

I’m perplexed by the less-than-stellar reviews this diner has received. It’s essential to remember that diners aren’t aspiring to be haute cuisine establishments; they embody the essence of classic, no-frills American dining. The extensive menu is what you'd expect from any reliable diner, with prices that won’t break the bank.

My recent visit saw every dish arriving promptly, served piping hot. The staff deserves recognition for their attentive service, especially considering our sizeable and famished group of runners just off the NYRR Manhattan 7 Mile. Despite a bustling atmosphere, they managed to seamlessly merge tables to accommodate us without a lengthy wait.

The breakfast was hearty and satisfying, hitting the spot perfectly. Post-meal, we weren’t hurried out the door but were instead offered more coffee, a gesture indicating that customer comfort is a priority here.

In light of the unwarranted poor ratings, I feel compelled to award this diner 4 stars. It stands as a testament to the unwavering charm and reliability of a good old-fashioned diner experience.",1
15026,"Such a cute festive restaurant . If youre looking to just have a good time with friends in a colorful setting, come here! Service was cool! They hostess and servers so cool!

12307,"Casual Thai but really delicious food! Husband and I were looking to try a new Thai place after our movie date last Saturday and this was one that showed up nearby that we thought was worth trying.I started off with Thai iced tea and we also ordered a glass of Rose. Started off with Chicken Satay and it was delicious, only thing I noticed was it was only 3 sticks while other places had at least 4 sticks. For entrees, we ordered their Crab Fried Rice to share and we also shared the Pad Thai and Red Curry Beef. All three were fantastic. Again, my bar for Thai food is set really high because I've traveled to Thailand many times and love Thai food so much that I decided to study a Thai Culinary course with the very best Chefs in Bangkok. That being said, the Crab Fried Rice was so delicious and they were generous with real and fresh crab meat. So worth it! The Pad Thai was very good. And the Red Curry Beef while not necessarily in the menu and they gladly offered to make for me, was very good. I still think it could have been more spicy because I already asked for it but I guess they'll always hold back in a healthy way, and I'm speaking across all Thai restaurants that I've eaten in here so far. As for the finale, the mango sticky rice was easily one of the best that I've had! I especially love that they have that coconut milk/cream on the side which is really the perfect way to do it. 4.5 out of 5. I can see us becoming regulars here. The only thing I truly wish they can take into consideration and improve on are their plates. I understand the overall feel from the menu to the plates are old/traditional Thai but the plates do not seem that polished and some are chipped on the sides. Other than that, they definitely won us over. We'll be back!",0
14776,"Title: Mixed Feelings at a Cozy Veggie Haven

My dining experience at this eatery was a true rollercoaster ride. First off, don't bother trying to reserve a spot; they don't accept them. Be prepared to wait, and potentially clash with a less-than-welcoming hostess.

Once seated, vegetarians may rejoice – the food is where this place shines. The ""spicy"" kale salad, while lacking in advertised heat, was deliciously light and accompanied by a convincing imitation chicken. For those on the hunt for a scrumptious start to the day, the avocado toast with poached eggs hit the mark, complementing an impressive mimosa selection that dazzles in variety, though disappoints in portion size relative to cost.

Beware, though, the space is rather cramped, and if you're unlucky like I was, you might find yourself perched uncomfortably on slanted seating in a corner.

While the food is undoubtedly healthy and tasty, the overall experience leaves much to be desired, particularly if you're planning a group brunch. I'm glad I tried it, but I'm in no rush to return.",1
19302,"Walked in without a reservation on a Saturday at 6PM.  We were seated right away. But the whole house was packed. I think we got really lucky. But it also seemed like every party that walked in after us all got seated fairly quickly because I didn't notice anyone waiting during the time we were there. Like others have stated, the tables are pretty darn close to each other. Not a place to have private conversations. your conversation can definitely be heard by your neighbors. Our waiter was attentive and the food came out in decent time. No crazy wait. And food came out hot. We started off with zucchini fritti and those came out piping hot! Yay! And I do recommend eating while they're hot because once they cool down, they're not as tasty. I got the eggplant parm. And it was delicious! The portion was big and it comes with rigatoni with marinara sauce. I really enjoyed their marinara sauce. And the eggplant parm was well balanced between the eggplant, cheese and breading. The cheese and breading wasn't the main part of the dish. Thank goodness. I devoured the whole dish and I was full but I wasn't disgustingly full. My water was never empty. Always a plus. The whole experience was great but if I were to pinpoint two negatives, it would be1) the complimentary bread isn't fresh. 2) when our main dishes came, we were still working on our zucchini. We tried to make it so they can place our main dishes down but our server (different guy from our waiter) instructed, ""put the zucchini on to your small plate."" It was the tone and the way he said it that was a little off putting. But other than that, everything was amazing!!!",0
11150,"Title: A Little Spot with Big Flavor!

I ventured into this quaint eatery for their Wednesday special, and let me tell you, the chicken parm sandwich was nothing short of amazing. With every bite, it was a battle to resist ordering a second round. Although I've yet to dive into their pizza selection, the slices on display were tantalizing – a feast for the eyes that promises to be a delight for the palate on my inevitable return visit.

The cozy size of the place might be its only minor drawback, with limited seating that speaks more to a grab-and-go vibe than a linger-over-lunch destination. Nevertheless, it's the ideal pitstop for a quick, indulgent bite.

The chicken parm has left a lasting impression, and anticipation is high for the pizza that awaits. If you find yourself in the area, do your taste buds a favor and drop by this charming little gem.",1
1192,"My bf and I were in the area looking for a quick but filling spot for dinner before we headed out to watch The Book of Mormon (such a funny Broadway show, I recommend seeing it) at the Eugene O'Neill Theatre a few minutes walk away. We ordered two poke bowls and Calpico drinks - the father and daughter were very accommodating as they were making our bowls. The BBQ eel and soba noodles are selections that sets this poké place apart from others, which I was so excited about! The portions were generous, the protein was fresh, mix-ins and toppings selections were wide, and a water dispenser and 6 stools were provided inside. During our meal here, we noticed that there were a lot of GrubHub drivers coming in to pick up food, so delivery seems to be a popular option as well. We will be back at this poké joint whenever we're in the area!",0
15361,"I recently dined at Benemon for dinner and had the opportunity to try the Gobo Sticks and the Una-Tama Don. The Gobo Sticks were a unique take on traditional fries, with a bark-like texture that made them stand out, though they might not be to everyone's taste unless you have a specific craving for burdock. The Una-Tama Don, while on the saltier side, offered a fair portion size that justified the price, and it's definitely something I would consider ordering again. The service at Benemon was noteworthy for its friendliness and attentiveness. I'm looking forward to returning to the restaurant to explore more of their menu offerings.",1
15504,This is my favorite go to place for steak when I used live in NYC before. I've been this place multiple times and I went back to this place eat steak with a friend. Food(3/5)- I haven't been this place since 2014. I was regular here before 2014 but I was back to this place for eat dinner with a friend Sunday night I hoped good as before but it's not. I really disappointed filet mignon. I usually ordered filet mignon but I ordered NY sirloin steak and my friend ordered filet mignon also we ordered appetizer for tomatoes with mozzarella cheese and glass of red wine. I ordered Well done for my steak and my friend ordered medium for filet mignon. Filet mignon was over cooked and it really chewy and we broth got hurt our tooth. I never disappointed this place before but I really disappointed this time. I told my friend to change steak but my friend said don't wanted any of bad feelings for our dinner. My steak was good than I respected. I wasn't sure filet mignon wasn't good that day or they over cooked by mistake. I can't recommend this place to my friends who visit in NYC from this experience.Service(5/5)-our waiter was amazing super friendly and he got good sense about wine. He recommended us to some of good red wine and we really enjoyed that. If you're here for eat the staffs are make sure you ok with their food and if you need something they will give you that right away. Ambience(3/5)-some of out side was renovating now and there's same interior as before. Not romantic place but modern. Very small space between table to table but it wasn't matter when you eat here. Bar selection was small than other but the bartenders were nice and you can watch any of sports while you drink.,0
14752,"This place saved the day when my groups intended lunch spot shockingly/sadly/tragically closed down. I don't think I am being too dramatic. Sous Vide Kitchen is an awesome little food hall. Instead of having to go to individual counters to order separate things, everything is done via iPads, making it extremely easy. Our group of 8 or so ordered everything in under 10 minutes. Everything looked good on the menu and they have everything from sandwiches, salads, grain bowls, ribs, literally everything. I got the High Give Rice & Quinoa bowl from the Bon Mi menu. It was incredible. It had pulled pork and everything had this sweet pineapple taste to it. I was a big fan. Everything compliment everything really well. It wasn't quite noon yet so it wasn't very busy at all. We were able to push a bunch of tables together so all of us could sit comfortably together. I definitely recommend coming here if you have a group. There  are plenty of tables and I can't see you ever having trouble getting a seat.",0
2178,"Title: A Divey Gem with Hearty Fare and Generous Spirits

If you're in search of a polished dining experience, this might not be your jam. But for those who embrace a bit of edge with their eats, this cool spot is a must-visit. Heed the divey vibe warning – it's part of the charm, right down to the garbage bag-draped toilet tank and the less-than-welcoming shattered entrance door.

The joy within is palpable, with bartenders generously pouring free Jamison shots that seem to amplify the already convivial atmosphere. The food is the real deal, offering soul-warming delights without the wallet-walloping prices. My group reveled in the drunken fish soup, indulged in perfectly cooked fried rice, and savored the 1.5 lb lobster – an absolute steal on their special rate nights.

At just $26 per person, including tips and our own beers, the value was unbeatable. And yes, leaving with three Jamison shots in hand? Just the cherry on top. This joint isn't just a newfound favorite for me; it's set to become the go-to spot I'll insist on showing off to all my out-of-town guests. Get ready to embrace the dive and dine in pure joy.",1
18332,"Really enjoyed Her Name is Han! Came here for brunch on a weekend, and loved the cozy and intimate feel of the restaurant. I ordered the baby octopus pasta, which was delicious! I enjoyed the slightly sweet, vinegar broth it came with. The sides were also good, although I wasn't as big of a fan of the soup, which had a strong seafood taste. I also got the strawberry grape fruit juice. Although it was delicious, I'm not sure it was worth the $7. I think Her Name is Han is definitely on the pricier side, but the taste, quality, and portion size made it worth it.Will definitely stop by again!",0

HUGE MISTAKE. We waited for an hour before it was our turn! However, after trying the pepperoni slice (about $5), I might be willing to suffer the wait again. It's really good. The pepperoni pieces are really thick, unlike any other I've had, and the slice is full of them. The crust is thick, doughy, and crunchy along the edges. It is not too greasy. Next time I might try ordering ahead for pickup or getting delivery to avoid the line.",0
20680,"Tonkatsu Matsunoya is a casual tonkatsu spot with a lot of delicious fried options. We ventured in on a Sunday during lunchtime in NYC and had to wait around 10-15 mins for a table of three. The food comes out pretty quickly here, so they are able to get people in and out in a reasonable amount of time. It's two stories with seating areas that aren't too big and tables are pretty close together, but they didn't open the top seating area when we were there. Food: Pork Loin Cutlet Teishoku (comes with rice and miso soup) - My friends and I all ordered the same thing. It came with cabbage salad and there was tonkatsu sauce on the table which was legit. It was perfectly fried tonkatsu, not too oily, and the meat was solid. It definitely hit the spot with the cabbage, rice, and miso soup. Not the most filling meal, but a balanced one. Overall, Tonkatsu Matsunoya serves a high-quality of tonkatsu! They have a lot of other fried dishes that they serve and many interesting combinations. Definitely a solid lunch spot, would recommend.",0
1743,"Title: A Pleasant Surprise Next to the Cinema

I'd always been curious about this restaurant near my go-to movie theatre, so I finally gave it a shot. Despite it being almost lunchtime, I opted for the brunch menu and went with the ""breakfast"" option—a classic combination of scrambled eggs, bacon, grits, and a biscuit.

Service was swift, and I was not disappointed. The bacon was cooked to perfection—a noteworthy feat for a bacon aficionado like myself. The eggs were flavorful, though the grits were a bit too milky for my taste, given my aversion to milk. However, the biscuit was a delightful surprise, drenched in maple syrup—it left me craving another.

I indulged in a strawberry margarita as well, which, despite its $14 price tag, proved to be a refreshing treat on a hot day. All in all, I left satisfied and curious about their lunch and dinner offerings—I’ll definitely be returning.",1
2603,"Title: A Delightful Dim Sum Experience Despite the Price

My dining companion and I recently decided to give in to our curiosity and try the bustling dim sum spot we've often passed by, especially during the busy Christmas week. To our delight, the place did not disappoint.

With a solid four out of five stars from us, the food truly shined. We sampled a variety of dishes, starting with the scallion pancake, which was crispy and flavorful. The pork soup dumplings followed, oozing with rich, savory broth that warmed us on a cold day. The shrimp rice roll was a smooth and delicate contrast, and the pork/chili dumpling provided just the right amount of kick.

Portion-wise, the amount was perfect for sharing between two, leaving us both satisfied. The dishes arrived steaming hot and tasted unmistakably fresh, a testament to the kitchen's efficiency and care despite the indicative hustle and bustle.

The service complemented our meal wonderfully; attentive and swift, contributing to our overall positive experience.

One caveat to an otherwise stellar visit was the pricing. For those familiar with traditional dim sum, the cost here may feel a bit steep. However, considering the quality of food and service, I would recommend this place, with the advisory note on the prices. It's worth the splurge for a special occasion or if you're looking to treat yourself to some quality dim sum.",1

It was bright with nice greenery around which gave the ambiance a great vibe for their customers. The music was at the perfect volume which was loud enough to sing along to but also allows you to hear the people around you.I came here with a group of 4 & got seated right away. We got water right away and ordered some drinks as well. We were recommended to try combo A which included Live craw fish, big head shrimp, potato and corn. We chose to get that in the Ghost street seafood boil which was absolutely delicious! This boil flavor was like no other that I have tried and couldn't believe how amazing each bite tasted! We also got recommended to try the special group combo which included starters and a variety of seafood. For the starters we got Chongqing Spicy popcorn chicken, fried calamari & Cajun fries. Everything tasted amazing! The Cajun fries were flavorful but not overwhelming and the popcorn chicken was one of the best that I've had. It also came with a sweet chili like sauce that went well with all of the items.The special group combo we got came with dungeness crab and clams with potato and corn. We got it in Cajun boil which was also finger licking good! We also got an order of the Chili oil braised big headed shrimp over noodles which was also really good.

11280,"Title: Fantastic Happy Hour Experience at [Restaurant Name]

My friends and I visited [Restaurant Name] on a Sunday night to take advantage of their happy hour offerings and were thoroughly impressed. The cocktail selection was top-notch, setting the tone for a delightful dining experience.

The stars of the evening were undoubtedly the tacos – the fish tacos burst with fresh, zesty flavors, while the steak tacos could easily be the best I've ever savored. Although the nachos were satisfactory, they were eclipsed by the other dishes we tried.

A special mention goes out to the queso fundido, which was scrumptious when wrapped in soft corn tortillas, though I believe a side of crunchy tortilla chips might elevate this dish even further, adding a delightful textural contrast.

Service was exceptional throughout the evening; attentive and courteous staff ensured our meal was both enjoyable and efficiently served. Considering the high quality of the food and drinks, the value was also impressive.

In summary, [Restaurant Name] delivered an outstanding happy hour experience, and I'm already looking forward to my next visit.",1
20734,"Title: Amidst the Chaos, a Culinary Gem

Stepping into the restaurant, one is immediately submerged into an ocean of chaos that somehow adds to its charm. The experience is a sensory overload with the crowd buzzing, the line snaking past the ordering counter, and the air tinged with the tantalizing aroma of sizzling food.

Service here is frenetic, and patience is a virtue. The process of ordering feels like being part of a lively market scene – shout your order, select your tortilla, and then play the waiting game. Here's a small piece of advice: keep track of your order or risk getting swept away by the tide of hungry patrons. A number system would be a godsend to tether the tumultuous process.

Now, the food: the Carne Asada Quesadilla on a Corn Tortilla is simply divine, and not your average quesadilla. Imagine cheese perfectly melded onto the tortilla – an unexpected but delightful twist. The Adobada Taco on Flour Tortilla is the star of the show; a masterful concoction of flavors that explodes in your mouth with each bite, a result of the tantalizing display of the spit-roasted adobada in the backdrop.

In summary, despite the disorder, this place is a must-visit for food enthusiasts. If you're prepared to brave the storm of people and bustle, you're in for a real treat. Their Adobada Taco alone is worth the adventure.",1

Date of Visit: 2/14/19

Review:

After indulging in an extraordinary pizza at Made In NY Pizza (a definite 10-star experience), my family and I stumbled upon a true gem—Luke's Lobster. The allure of their sign was too strong to ignore, so I ventured in solo, leaving the family momentarily behind.

This quaint and beautifully arranged eatery immediately felt welcoming, complete with exceptionally friendly staff. Inquiring about their bestseller, I was pointed to the Lobster Roll. Even though we were full from our pizza feast (let's not forget that marvelous Square Pepperoni pie), I couldn't resist and ordered two Lobster Rolls, both cut in half to share among the four of us.

Each roll was an explosion of taste: heaps of jumbo lobster nestled in a perfectly-toasted, buttery bun. The freshness and quality were simply unparalleled—a culinary delight that had us savoring every bite.

Impressed and still dreaming about the experience, my wife and I plan to return this weekend to dine in and explore more of the menu. Luke's Lobster provided an extraordinary food journey, and I'm already considering bumping up my rating to a full 5 stars after our next visit. Lobster dreams indeed!

The french toast was good but a bit disappointing when I received it--looked like they used Wonder bread instead of the usual Texas toast. Still hit the spot for my french toast craving but falls short compared to other diners.",0
19919,"LOVED this place. But for my appetizer it would have been 5 stars. AMBIANCEIts two floors so there is plenty of space however it still makes you feel comfy at the same time. Comfortable chairs and nice decorations. Simple. SERVICEAmazing service. Honestly, probably one of the best service experiences I have had. From the hostess to the waiter to the bussers- really, just impressive.   FOODThis is the onlyyyy reason that this is not five stars - as an appetizer my date [now bf, s/o to this place for a good date lol]  and I ordered the vegan cheese plate and we both disliked it. I love cheese so much and it's the only reason I cannot be vegan - this solidified my opinion on vegan cheese, unfortunately. However, you do get this apple beat salad that is AMAZING even if it doesn't sound it. Strong, but good. We both ordered spaghetti and wheat balls and it was so delicious. The ""meat"" and the sauce was seasoned perfectly and I enjoyed every bite. We also ordered the roaster cauliflower and it was absolutely DELICIOUS. I highly recommend it as a side, it does not disappoint. We didn't order dessert. DRINKSThey had a great selection. I ordered a Riesling and I liked what they gave me. My bf ordered some kind of cocktail and he enjoyed it. PRICEA little pricey - you can look at a bill of approximately $130 before tip if you have limited drinks and courses. Totally worth it to me though.",0
2044,"My absolute favorite Chinese food spot. I love their General Tso lunch special as it's only $11 and is delicious. They use all fresh ingredients and it also comes with fried rice and soup! I always get their pork buns because they're my favorite, so soft and flavorful. The ambiance is casual/modern and the service is very attentive. I definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for good Chinese food in the area.",0
11372,"Title: A Seafood Lover's Paradise in NYC

I simply can't recommend this place enough – it's finger-licking good! As a seafood aficionado, I insist that if you haven't dined here, you're missing out on a culinary treasure. They've mastered the art of seafood, especially their crab legs, which are exceptionally sweet and, when paired with their unique homemade seasoning, become utterly delectable. This spot has quickly become my favorite Southern-style seafood haunt in the city, and it feels like home. Service is commendable, although you should anticipate a wait due to its popularity. But trust me, the wait is well worth it.",1
3645,"I met up with an old friend for dinner. We ended up coming here without prior planning. This was one of few noodle shops in the Financial District. As with most NYC restaurants, the dining area wasn't very big, so we had to wait a bit before there were any open spots. The wait staff was pretty friendly and got our orders in fairly quickly. We both ordered the Okinawa shio ramen. I also got the edamame.*Okinawa shio ramen*I wasn't looking for a bowl of ramen with overly spicy or extra greasy broth and this bowl certainly fit the bill. Here were the ingredients listed on their menu: chicken and fish broth, chashu pork, naruto, egg, green onion, arugula, bean sprout, bamboo, sesame, corn, garlic chips, sesame oil, and butter. Most were standard items used in ramen, so there wasn't anything unique that would make it stand out from many other bowls of ramen that I've had. However it was still a decent bowl of ramen, but I had an issue with it not being served piping hot.Overall, this place was A-OK. If I'm in the area and in the mood for some ramen, I might just stop in here to check out the other items on their menu.",0
18497,"NYC is famous for a lot of things and amongst the list is Ramen. So naturally there is a myriad of options for Ramen and Noodles in the city because everyone wants a piece of the pie but Raku is a diamond in the rough. It may not be as well known and high-fi as the other big ones like Ippudo and Momofuku but its homey, authentic and delicious. Personal favorites from my group of friends were the Tantan, Niku and Curry ramen. Reservations aren't terribly hard to come by and it s great for groups so next time you're in the mood for some ramen, check out Raku!",0
16396,"Wow one of the best spots I've been to so far in the city! And given it wasn't packed inside, I'd say I found myself a little gem in Murray Hill Inside is quaint and cozy with bright colored tables and accents on the wall I ordered the special beef pho (comes with bone marrow and cueller which I didn't know of in English but it's you tiao for those who understand Chinese). After seeing all the photos with the giant bone I was immensely excited and I was not disappointed!! The bone marrow itself was melt in your mouth, the cueller reminded me of my childhood and the pho broth was rich and had a flavor that stood on its own (usually I have to add a good amount of sriracha and oyster sauce but I didn't feel that this time). Also I loved the touch of fried garlic in the soup, it added a unique flavorIn total paid around $30 - while not a steal, I do feel the pho was special enough to be a treat yo'self meal",0
10989,"Casa Apicii is certainly no longer on the Eater Heatmap, but it is still a difficult reservation to come by and always a great experience. The starters, pasta dishes and mains are all great. The wine list -- entirely Italian wines -- is good and extensive. The cocktails are good too. The desserts are a weak spot, but are fine as well. All and all a good meal and a terrific evening.",0
10863,"Title: A Delightful Twist on Filipino Classics at [Restaurant Name]

I recently dined at [Restaurant Name] with expectations of traditional Filipino cuisine, only to discover a delightful Filipino-American fusion that left me pleasantly surprised. The service was exceptional, with the chef, Jappy, personally ensuring our satisfaction between courses.

The appetizers, particularly the lumpia, arrived hot and crispy, a testament to their freshness. Though initially forgetting I was not eating a traditional spring roll, the lumpia quickly became a standout with its delicious flavors. For the main course, the Kare Kare stole the show. The oxtails were succulent, and the peanut sauce beautifully complemented them. I appreciated the side serving of shrimp paste, allowing for personalization to taste.

Though we skipped dessert, the mention of an Ube option piqued my interest for a future visit. And with an enticing brunch menu awaiting, I am eager to return to [Restaurant Name] for another round of their unique and yummy fare.",1
15927,"During a recent visit to a local eatery, my dining companion and I delved into the world of Italian comforts, courtesy of their lunch/dinner special menu, which features an appealing price range of $13-$15 per item. My friend chose the eggplant parmigiana, a standout dish with a particularly savory tomato sauce that delivered a satisfying punch of flavor. My selection, the spaghetti carbonara from the regular menu, though perfectly al dente, fell somewhat flat; it relied too heavily on the overly rich prosciutto for taste, with the sauce itself lacking a certain je ne sais quoi.

Service was amicable, though the establishment's single-napkin policy could be improved with the simple addition of tableside dispensers. It's worth noting an unconventional approach to tipping was observed—receipts with predetermined gratuity were presented for signature without the opportunity for patrons to specify their own amount. While the suggested tip did not deviate significantly from my intended contribution, a preference for personal discretion remains.

In summary, the restaurant delivered a mixed bag - worth a visit for the well-executed eggplant parmigiana and fair pricing, but with room for improvement in both the culinary nuances and customer autonomy at checkout.",1
15322,This is a small Mediterranean place with around 10 seats. I stopped by and tried their falfal balls. They fried it fresh after I ordered. The hot sauce was very hot. But falafel tasted good.,0
356,"Title: A Slice of Perfection

From the moment the first piece of pizza hit my taste buds, I was in gastronomic heaven. Admittedly skeptical about thicker crusts, I dove into the Sicilian pepperoni pizza and was immediately converted. The cheese fused with the dough in a harmonious dance that only true culinary artistry can achieve. 

But the star of the evening was undoubtedly the olive pesto ricotta pizza. It's rare to find such a flawless symphony of flavors and textures, not to mention the innovation behind the unique combination. It was a delightful surprise that left an indelible impression.

My mother-in-law, sampling American pizza for the first time, couldn't have asked for a better introduction. We certainly stumbled upon a gem - this place is a jackpot for any pizza aficionado.",1
1379,"There was so much excitement coming to try Vanessa's only to be let down. I love dumplings with a passion, and Vanessa's was like that physically attractive girl, but you find out not so in the inside. My older brother took charge in ordering, and we got pork and chives dumpling along with a noodle dish. The dumplings were so bland even with the sauce. The noodles were also so plain that we forced fed ourselves to not waste food. I'm not sure if I would give this place a shot again as it seems like a tourist trap. I might only come here to try to Spicy Wontons as I heard that was the only thing you should get here. I don't know Vanessa, I have to swipe left for now.",0
18572,"Title: A Farewell Feast to Remember at (Restaurant Name)

Before the world went quiet and we all cozied into isolation, I had the pleasure of indulging in what now stands as my last exceptional meal out, and quite possibly the best burger experience in NYC, thanks to a tip-off from my friend @rboucher. Not only did this place redefine my burger standards with their Pat LaFrieda Burger—think LaFrieda beef smothered in EMMY sauce and enveloped by a soft pretzel bun—but they dared to pair it with the most irresistible curly fries in the market.

However, it's their gourmet Detroit-style pizzas that warrant a standing ovation. The Pig Freaker Pizza, a gastronomic delight marrying bacon with kimchi and a drizzle of miso queso, was a study in how the unexpected can dance harmoniously on the taste buds—if perhaps with half the queso.

While the Arenstein Pizza's bold vodka sauce and sweet-spicy fusion of pepperoni, pickled chili, and honey left an unforgettable impression, it's the thought of not sampling their culinary genius during this period that truly saddens me. Out of reach for their delivery, I'm left yearning for the day I can return and surrender to the indulgence of their pizzas once more.

And let's not forget the Lady Goodman cocktail, a refreshing concoction of blanc de blanc and hibiscus vodka, touched with the floral notes of St. Elder elderflower liqueur and Earl Grey, completed with a splash of lemon. A perfect toast to a meal—and memories—that beg to be revisited post-isolation. Here's hoping they weather this storm because NYC needs its dose of gourmet comfort food, and I need those pizzas.",1
11479,"When in New York, a pilgrimage to the fabled first pizzeria in the United States is non-negotiable for pizza aficionados. Lombardi's, with its storied oven and rich history, presents an experience that goes beyond mere dining—it's a bite of culinary heritage. The standout recommendation? Any pizza graced with ricotta cheese. Indulge in the creaminess by adding an extra dollop. Missing out on Lombardi's is akin to missing out on a slice of pizza paradise.",1
1809,"I visited this popular eatery at 2 pm on a Sunday and was immediately struck by the bustling crowd. Despite the potential 40-minute wait for a table, my solo status landed me a cozy spot at the bar. I dove into the highly recommended Israeli breakfast complemented by a side of falafel. The eggs were a standout, impossibly soft and cooked to perfection. The Labneh cheese offered a delightful tang, akin to Greek yogurt in flavor and texture. However, the star of the meal was undoubtedly the falafel—exceptionally crunchy exteriors giving way to tender, flavorful interiors. Finding such well-executed falafel is a rarity, and it did not disappoint. Do note, the vibrant atmosphere contributes to a noisy environment, so those in search of a tranquil brunch spot might need to look elsewhere.",1
1571,"Title: A Letdown at a Family Favorite

As I wandered into Chinatown, nostalgia steered me toward Sun Sai Gai, an old-school spot revered by my mom for its BBQ pork buns. It had been ages since I last savored one, so my expectations were tinged with childhood memories and a hearty appetite.

Optimistically, I ordered two buns, eager for that delightful blend of savory meat wrapped in a fluffy dough. Sadly, what I encountered was a shadow of the past. While the buns did echo the familiar flavors of yesteryear, they were dishearteningly hollow, sporting merely a scant layer of pork. The promise of a succulent meat-filled center was unmet, with an imbalance heavily skewed towards bread.

Service was perfunctory at best, aligning with my minimal expectations for such an established eatery. Despite the underwhelming experience, a part of me holds out hope. Maybe it was an off day, or perhaps the kitchen was conserving resources. Whatever the case, I might return, allowing Sun Sai Gai one more chance to recapture the culinary magic my mom had always praised.",1
12700,"After many trips to NYC, finally was able to snag seats at Balthazar. I walked in solo without a reservation around 4pm on a Friday afternoon right before dinner service and was seated promptly. I would say about half the restaurant was full, and the bar area was packed so if you have a small party and no rezzos perhaps trying off peak hours to grab a bite at this famed French establishment. Since it was just me, I ordered a glass of wine and the steak which was way more than enough food for one person (they are also constantly refilling you with delicious servings of French bread which I love). After a short wait, my steak arrived pipping hot and ready to be devoured. I would say my steak was cooked a tad bit longer than I liked and was on the side of medium rather than medium rare. However the peppercorn sauce was delicious, fries were crunchy and the spinach was heaven (probably my favorite thing on the plate). It may seem like a pricey plate of food ($54) however 1) this is Balthazar, and 2) the piece of steak you're served is a monster and can easily be shared. As a final touch, I was given a glass of champagne that they serve to solo diners. Service was great, quick and friendly. While it is a pain to get a reservation here, if you're lucky and you're able to get in the food is delicious and while its not extremely different than other French NYC staples, it does carry a charm that cannot be found. Can't wait to come back and share more memories.",0
17529,"Title: A Cozy, Cabin-in-the-Woods Experience with Room for Improvement

My visit to this much-talked-about venue left me with mixed impressions. On the positive side, the drinks from the mixology menu ranged from good to great, demonstrating their bar staff's expertise. The unique feature of multiple small outdoor spaces provided a charming, almost secluded feeling and the fire pits were a cozy touch on a chilly evening.

For those with dietary restrictions, it was reassuring to hear that the restaurant is willing to accommodate gluten-free options, even though I didn't partake myself.

On the downside, the popularity of the place meant enduring a 15-minute wait, which isn't egregious, but for those averse to lines, it's something to consider. The inside felt more like a cramped, dark wooden maze than the airy, open rooftop I had envisioned.

In summary, while the setting was novel, evoking a ""cabin in the woods"" vibe right in the heart of the city, the overall experience was just okay. I can't say I'm eager to revisit, especially if I have to navigate through crowds again. It may be worth another shot in the summer, but for now, it didn't quite live up to the hype for me.",1
16354,"Rating: ★★★½☆

At Estela, the concept of sharing-style small plates invites diners into a world of culinary curiosity. Standout dishes like the texturally delightful mussels on toast and the uniquely presented pork with samphire showcased the kitchen's bold approach to international flavors, a nod to the chef's creative vision. The grilled foie gras enveloped in a grape leaf was an indulgent highlight that didn't disappoint.

However, not all plates hit the mark; the endive salad, though bright in its conception, was cumbersome to eat, and the dressing was regrettably heavy-handed with oil. Additionally, while the concept of sharing is convivial, the execution falters slightly when considering the value proposition. Despite the quality, the portions don't quite justify the price, a point of contention when paired with the restaurant's vibrant yet ear-splitting ambiance and cramped seating arrangements.

What Estela lacks in comfort, it attempts to make up for in service, particularly with astute wine pairings that complement the meal's highs. Alas, for those seeking a more relaxed, intimate dining experience at this price point, Estela may fall just shy of expectations.",1
2532,"I regret not heeding the online reviews before dining here. The stinginess with burger toppings - lettuce and tomato - was surprising. The service was perfunctory and lacked enthusiasm. Overall, the flavors in most dishes were disappointingly bland. I cannot recommend this place and won't be returning.",1
2546,"A good luncheonette. Great sandwiches and salads. It is a small place, tables are close together. But it is a great place. I go for the chicken salad on rye. It is packed and tasty. The chef salads, the club sandwiches, are all great. A hidden gem on East 50th.",0
10159,"Title: A Touch of Paris on the Lower East Side

As a solo diner seeking a slice of self-care on a lazy Sunday during a long weekend, I discovered a gem of French cuisine nestled in the Lower East Side, easily accessible from the F train at East Broadway. This French bistro transported me straight to a classic Parisian café with its elegant New York twist. My decision, guided by glowing Yelp reviews, led me to an unassuming corner where the bistro's annex bakery tempted passersby with authentic French pastries.

The one-man-show service was nothing less than impressive. My server adeptly juggled roles from hostess to cashier, embodying the epitome of hard work and professionalism. Despite being busy, he managed the bistro’s operations with admirable efficiency and respect for each patron, including myself.

My brunch experience was heightened by the remarkable Eggs Norwegian: poached eggs oozing atop English muffins, complemented by marinated salmon and a perfectly light Hollandaise sauce that didn't overpower the fresh ingredients. The side of roasted potatoes fell slightly short, being a tad overcooked, yet a light, superbly dressed salad balanced the dish.

A boozy brunch isn't complete without the cocktail, and my mimosa was as delightful as it was pulpy—a minor hiccup for my pulp-averse palate. A switch from coffee to Bio Tea Malongo's mint tea proved serendipitous; its aromatic qualities acted as a brief but potent aromatherapy session, soothing my senses.

The charming touch of a vintage postcard bill, complete with a foreign postage stamp, marked the end of a well-priced meal - $29 for such quality fare felt just right. Worth noting, the bistro is a cash-only establishment, though an ATM inside provides convenience.

In summary, this quaint bistro offers a delectable escape to France in the heart of New York City, with service that goes above and beyond. Whether for brunch or bakery cravings, it's a culinary corner I wholeheartedly recommend.",1
12958,"Title: Cozy Vibes and Tasty Bites at Barepas

Review:

Stepping into Barepas is like wrapping yourself in a warm, welcoming blanket. The art-adorned walls, expertly displayed wine bottles, and inviting hardware set the stage for a laid-back dining experience that's perfect for unwinding with friends over wine and appetizers.

During our visit, my husband and I were instantly drawn to the community table near the bar, which promises great times for larger gatherings. The cachapas with chorizo I ordered were a hit—savory and satisfying. While the amanecida arepas' sweet notes weren't entirely to my taste, anyone with a penchant for sweeter fare would devour them with delight, especially with the pulled pork and goat cheese mingling in every bite.

My husband's la parilla offered an array of grilled meats. Although the blood sausage was not to his usual taste, the other components—succulent steak, tender chicken, and additional chorizo, accompanied by bite-sized arepa balls—received his hearty approval.

A nod to our attentive waiter who deftly recommended a wine pairing that complemented our meal beautifully. Barepas has undoubtedly become a cherished gem in the area, promising a repeat visit from us in the near future.",1
18460,"I visited this Thai restaurant for their lunch special and found it to be fairly average among the Thai places I've experienced. The service was commendable, attentive, and prompt. However, the pad Thai was underwhelming in flavor, and the pad see ew was just passable. It was a decent meal, but not particularly memorable in terms of culinary delight.",1
2067,"This place has been here forever! I was extremely happy to see that they were open during this hard time. Covid has everything shut down in NYC, but when you have to work because you can't do your job from home, this place is a total oasis. In my younger days, I used to come here for late night greasy food after a night of fun. But this place is more than that, it is a neighborhood institution that is surviving in the ever gentrifying East Harlem, where the price of rent and food keeps skyrocketing. This place has stay friendly to the neighbors by keeping their prices fair without sacrificing in taste. By the time I arrive there today, I was famished and although all the fried stuff like relleno de papas, alcapurrias, pastelillos (empanadas) and other delicious Puerto Rican delicacies were just mouth watering, I opted for their combo # 2, which consisted of a large container of arroz con gandules, 1 lb of pernil, habichuelas (beans), a salad and a 32 oz passion fruit drink, for $23. I added a rotisserie chicken bringing my total to $31. Left the nice lady a healthy tip and still felt the price was more than fair. Everything in the store doesn't just look delicious, they ARE delicious! I'm so glad they're still open after all this time.",0
12297,"I originally found out about this restaurant through a Buzzfeed video raving about desserts. The cannoli was featured, and I went into the meal thinking I was going to order it for dessert. However, I was super shocked to find out that it costs almost $30 for a cannoli! Given it's really big and aesthetically pleasing, it's just crazy to me. The flavor was also peanut butter, but I thought they would have more flavors like birthday cake (the one featured in the video). Anyway, I ended up getting the spaghetti pomodoro and one of the spritz as my drink. The meal overall was solid. My pasta in particular didn't really stand out, but I mean it's just a basic spaghetti with tomato sauce and basil. For what it was, it was straight forward and good. It's nice that the restaurant offers 10% off on Yelp if you check in though. Overall, decent restaurant but unsure if I would come again.",0
19561,$1.50 for the small and $3 for the large. Made fresh to order. It's soft and silky. Enough flavor and texture. I got one pork and one beef. One with egg and one without. Egg is .50 cent extra. They will add soy sauce for you but you can ask for more or none. Also you can add hot sauce as well. It was served hot and its delicious. Wish they have these carts in SF.,0
3496,"This area was in desperate need of a good pho spot, but this place is just ok. Crab spring rolls were way too oily - wouldn't get them again. The combination pho was good, not great. The broth and meat were both very good, but the thick noodles didn't quite hold the flavor of the broth. Make the trek downtown and go to Hanoi House instead.",0
19890,"Tucked away in a prime spot, this restaurant is a gem for those looking for delicious food and drinks in a vibrant atmosphere. On my recent late-night visit, I was particularly impressed by the Vodka Cobbler – it was a delightful and refreshing concoction. While the menu was limited due to the hour, the almond cauliflower was a standout; the inventive addition of cheese to the almonds added a creative twist that didn't disappoint. The meat plate, although generally satisfactory, was slightly overshadowed by a dipping sauce that erred on the side of too sour for my taste. However, the pickles served alongside were a hit. This place has the perfect vibe for unwinding after work or for a laid-back reunion with friends over drinks and nibbles.",1
16429,"I love El Camion cantina. It is one of the best and most affordable Mexican restaurants in the area. Their brunch deals are amazing-for around $10-$15 you get an entree and a drink. I personally am a fan of the frozen margaritas. Dinner here is also good and although prices are a bit higher than for brunch, the amount of food you get makes up for it. If it's your first time here I recommend you get the green tomatillo chilaquiles with pulled chicken, you won't regret it!",0
10869,"Such a cool concept, Cuban-Chinese fusion! Add to that a rustic atmosphere with open windows and partially outdoor seating and it's off to a good start!We really wanted to try the fusion dishes we couldn't find anywhere else. While the man-po maduros were arguably one of the best dishes I've ever had (totally nailed the fusion I was looking for, with pork and Sichuan peppercorns), the rest of the apps were good, but not great. The cheesecake flan was also really good and a perfect sweet way to finish the meal.On top of it, the specialty cocktail, Revolucion was totally unique and delicious if you're looking for something genuinely spicy/sweet. However, the cocktails were a touch pricy ($16/per).Overall a really good experience. Our waiter was nice and helpful and the meal was pleasant. Would recommend!",0
10339,"Title: A Hidden Gem Next to AMC 34th Street

I stumbled upon a delightful little spot just a half block from the AMC on 34th Street, a true blessing for a cinephile like me. The highlight of their menu was the food, which impressed beyond expectations.

My companion opted for the 1/4 white-meat chicken with pinto beans and maduros. Although the chicken leaned towards the drier side, the aji verde sauce was a game changer—definitely a must-have. The maduros stole the show with their perfect crispy exterior and succulent sweetness inside. The beans were decent but screamed for a companion of rice to round out the dish.

I indulged in the Chirp chicken sandwich, a mouthwatering creation with juicy shredded rotisserie chicken, maduros, green sauce, honey mustard, lettuce, and tomato. This gem of a sandwich had a harmonious mix of flavors and textures that made it a standout choice.

Dessert was the passion fruit pie, an exceptional take on a notoriously difficult flavor to nail in the States. While the bruleed top suffered slightly from refrigeration, the pie itself was a custard-like triumph of sweet and tart.

Overall, this eatery is a must-visit - especially if you're catching a movie nearby and are in the mood for a tasty meal with some standout items. Just make sure to leave room for dessert, even if sharing proves to be a challenge!",1

10248,"Solid 4.5! Came in for work lunch - service is slow but pizza was excellent. We tried fried calamari and the autumn salad (excellent) to start- we each ordered choice of pizza, pasta or sub. There was a dairy allergy but they were accommodating and omitted mozzarella on the meatball sub. I liked that for pizza you can order half (3slices) or whole (6slices) which is great so you can try different things. Everything was good overall and quality was fresh. I would recommend with a group- location was good!",0
14065,"I came at around 7:20pm on a Sunday evening and it was packed. There were a ton of people waiting but I got seated in the communal tables right away since it was just me. There's nothing outside that has the restaurant's name but if you're in the area and there are Japanese letters it's probably the right place.I ordered the Karaka-men ($16) which was SO GOOD. The noodles are really good, the pork is tender and really soft. The broth is as good as I've ever had. The spice level was on point and added great flavor. It was delicious and definitely one of the best ramen I've ever had.If I ever come back to New York this is one of the places I have to visit again. Oh boy was this a delicious bowl of ramen.",0
16078,"During a lull at this charming eatery, we were swiftly seated, a prelude to our indulgence in an all-dessert feast. My espresso shake was a symphony of well-matched chocolate and espresso notes, while my girlfriend praised her mystery-flavored shake with equal enthusiasm. My daughter's chocolate pizza was a delightful surprise, and my friend's strawberry crepe was not only generously portioned but also boasted the perfect consistency. With fair prices for the satisfying portions, this place has certainly earned a return visit. Delicious indeed.",1

Furthermore, after deciding I was craving their burger tonight, by the time I got there, it was 9:45 and the kitchen was closed upon walking in, however after asking, the waitress fit in one last order if we ordered ASAP.

13323,"I was really impressed with my experience here at the Trump Grill, as well as Trump Tower. It was really upscale yet comfortable, not too stuffy. Also, the prices did not break the bank! We approached the hostess stand, she took my name, phone number and said there was about a 15 minute wait, but she'd text me when our table was ready--- which was super convenient, allowing us to check out the gift shop and holiday decorations. The Christmas tree and holiday decorations were fantastic! The grill itself is not that large, there is a decent sized bar with chairs and also some tables and then some large booths up a few stairs on an upper level. The theme was classy with dark wood, mirrors, brass yet light fixtures...very cozy. They also have a Trump Cafe as well, and a separate Trump Bar. The cafe had lower price point, casual options and the bar was an adult type place for drinks and power meetings. I had the flatbread which was wood fired and delicious! It was really good, with a slight crisp and lots of cheese, and fresh cherry tomatoes. My friends had the burger and fries, they enjoyed their meals as well.So, I ordered a Stella beer ($8) to go with my flatbread ($15) instead of my usual Chardonnay...I had noticed they only carry Trump Winery selections and a large pour/glass was like $18...mind you, this is on 5th Avenue in NYC, so I am hard pressed to say that's expensive all things considered but yet it seemed a little bit on the pricey side...FYI, I did hear some other guests discussing the wine situation. I could not tell if they were amused or irritated with only Trump Winery selections, LOL. It was sooo cool to eat here, the service was stellar and the decor was beautiful...we rode on the iconic escalator Trump came down to announce his campaign....loved it! Also, Secret Service is out front and also inside, where you must go through a security check point. It was no big deal. The gift shop was very, very entertaining, they sell all things Trump as you can imagine and the salespeople are on point. So fun! We bought all kinds of knick-knacks and had a blast. Be sure to stop in, you will really enjoy yourself!",0
18230,"Tucked away as a Japanese basement bar gem, this spot is an easy one to overlook but deserves a stop. My visit was on a quieter evening, sans live music, which I heard is not to be missed. Nonetheless, the ambiance was relaxed and inviting. Among their inventive cocktail lineup, the ""Reiwa"" stood out with its unique, unfamiliar ingredients, delivering an exceptional taste experience. Additionally, their happy hour offerings are a steal with fantastic deals on small plates, perfect for a light bite alongside your drink. Highly recommend for a laid-back yet sophisticated outing.",1
11361,"Title: Authentic Tonkatsu Experience with a Side of Superior Service

I recently visited a remarkable restaurant that served one of the best Tonkatsu dishes I've had stateside, rivaling some of Japan's finest. The pork cutlet was exceptionally juicy, with a satisfyingly snappy texture, enveloped in a light and crispy batter that miraculously avoided greasiness.

I'd highly recommend enhancing your meal with the accompanying side of sesame seeds—it's a small touch that significantly elevates the flavors. Additionally, don't miss out on their delectable sides. The takoyaki in dashi broth was a novel treat, akin to a soup with octopus balls, offering a unique texture and taste that's definitely worth trying. Meanwhile, the seafood mix was reminiscent of a delicate poke dish with a miso twist, featuring bite-sized pieces of sashimi and raw seafood that were undeniably fresh and light.

Service excellence was the cherry on top of our dining experience—attentive, prompt, and courteous. One heads-up for visitors: unlike their other locations, tipping is expected here, which might come as a surprise to those familiar with Japanese dining customs. Nevertheless, this establishment is a must-visit spot for Tonkatsu aficionados and Japanese cuisine enthusiasts alike.",1
17556,"I recently grabbed takeout lunch from this spot and found it to be a dependable choice for sushi lovers. While the menu doesn’t boast innovative offerings, it delivers a solid, standard sushi experience that aligns well with the price. The lunch special they offer presents a reasonable value, making it a viable option for a midday meal.",1
17574,"First and foremost, Via Carota doesn't take reservations. Two friends and I stopped by around 5pm on a Friday and ultimately got seated around 8pm. The Via Carota wait is amongst the longest I've ever seen in New York. Be sure to make arrangements accordingly and don't expect to just walk into dinner. Via Carota was really good, and I think it generally lived up to the hype. I think there's so many Italian restaurants in NY that are wayyyy overhyped for what they are, but I'll spare you that rant.We started our meal with some aperol spritz because as New Yorkers, the minute the temperature outside is over 55 degrees after a long winter, we jump on the opportunity. The chianti wine we later ordered was also quite good.As far as the food goes, I think everything is very sharable, which is what we ultimately did. We ordered a variety of things from the menu, but the dishes I liked the most were the carrots (I have seriously never had carrots so good and generally don't even like steamed carrots), the insalata verde (VERY good despite it basically just being just romaine lettuce), and the pappardelle. My friend LOVED the cacio e pepe and said it was probably the best he's ever tried.The service was to my liking - they didn't stop by enough to disrupt the flow of our conversation, but were attentive enough so that we didn't feel ignored. Also shoutout to the staff for moving so quickly when it decide to torrential downpour outside!",0
19168,"This was my first time here and I was very impressed. I'll start with the decor. It was very aesthetically pleasing with the sleek Japanese design and orchid plants. And now for the food. Mine was delicious and so fresh. I had a salad with cooked salmon, edamame, cucumbers, lettuce, seaweed, peppers and a little bit of ginger. I had the Ponzu dressing, which was delicious. There were a lot of other dressing choices. Service was great and the place was spotless. I would definitely recommend if you're in the Penn/Times Square area. On one of the hottest days of the year, it was a cool relief and a nice place to have a delicious meal.",0
2109,"I ordered massum curry with chicken. According to the menu, it's 15 bucks. They charged me 17 bucks. When I pointed out, they said the menu is not updated. If the price has changed, please let people know before they order.It's not a matter of 2 bucks but the dishonesty hurts the reputation. Be careful when you order. Maybe you want to clarify the price to be sure.",0
14181,"Barbounia was solid. Standouts were the Indigo cocktail, Taramasalata (we had a selection of three mezze along with the eggplant and spicy feta) and grilled ocean trout special. Crudités, Flash fried cauliflower, Wild mushrooms and steak were all decent. Barbougelach for dessert was good too.",0
16696,"I came here for restaurant week on a Tuesday around 7 pm. I recommend making a reservation. This is a 2-floor restaurant with a small bar. Very modern and visually appealing. For an appetizer, we got two orders of Mandu, which were perfectly fried and very flavorful. We also got Pork Belly Steamed Buns, which were light, fluffy, and packed full. We decided to get 3 BBQ options, the Bulgogi, Mae Wun Yang (spicy pork), and the Yang (lamb). All the BBQ was very well marinated and seasoned. You do cook the meat yourself, but I am sure if you ask, they will help you out. For dessert, we had the Banana Sabayon, which has such a deep banana flavor. We also had the Omija Napoleon, which was flakey and light. This was a great deal for restaurant week ($42) a person, which included an appetizer, entree, and dessert. Overall, a great date night spot or dinner with family. It is on the pricier side.",0
18115,"More like 3 1/2 stars.We truly want to support Jose and all his humanitarian efforts. Mar is the only real sit down and upscale restaurant at the Mercado of Hudson Yards. We came here first because of it.After viewing the menu, we decided to share a couple items to take the edge off and then try one of the other stand up places. The prices were quite high here for the portions, even though we realize that seafood is expensive and we were in New York City.My girlfriend and husband each had a glass of wine for around $15-17; her husband's beer was $10. They gave us some complimentary green olives that came in a cute dish with an attached dish on the side for the pits. They shared a shallow serving of paella with 3 large shrimp on it on top of cut up bits of toasted pasta (instead of rice). There were no vegetables or anything else in the pasta. It was good, but the portion was small. The presentation was nice, however. We shared an appetizer of fried fish marinated in spices served with a dipping sauce on the side. Four small pieces of fish were spaced out on a long plate. The fish was good. I asked for a piece of bread. They brought two small baskets to the table -- as I was the only one who wanted any, we tried to send one back. They insisted. We found out later they charged us $4 for the bread.  I'm glad we went if only to support Jose, but we were starving when we left. We happily went to one of the empanada and bocata places in the market just outside the enclosed restaurant, and had a very good half sandwich.",0
1098,"Title: Flavorful Arepas and More at This Vibrant Eatery

I recently visited a restaurant that boasts a fantastic selection of arepas, including a 'build your own' option that extends to bowls and salads. What sets this place apart is the availability of fresh vegetables, an array of proteins (with vegan choices too), and a multitude of spices that can cater to any palate.

The arepas deserve a special mention. Not only are they tasty, but they also come in various flavors. I indulged in the Reina Pepiada, an arepa filled with a scrumptious blend of chicken salad, avocado, and mayo. I jazzed it up with some tomato, jalapeño, and a daring dab of their spicy green sauce – a sinus-clearing delight that spice enthusiasts like myself will adore.

My friend opted for a salad topped with tender short rib, proving that the menu has something for everyone. Although we didn't try the fried sides this time, the tequenos and empanadas looked tempting.

One downside is the lack of tap water, and canned drinks come at a premium of $2. Despite that, the food quality and flavors shine, making the arepas the unmissable highlight of this culinary gem.",1
12024,"Dropped into this cozy spot post-work on my way to my Airbnb, craving some tuna sashimi. The service was swift; my order landed on the table within 10 minutes. Despite the small size, the place was bustling with the dinner crowd, yet the atmosphere remained inviting. The sashimi was delicious, and a generous portion too—at 7.34 oz, it was enough to cover both dinner and an office snack the next morning. A satisfying experience for the palate and the schedule!",1
19715,"Title: A Hidden Gem on Wheels: The Tibetan Momo Truck at 46th and Third

If you find yourself near 46th and Third, do yourself a favor and visit the new Tibetan Momo truck that's the talk of the town. In a sea of usual food truck fare, this truck stands out by serving up an array of mouthwatering Momos - South Asian dumplings that are a delightful nod to the Himalayas. Think the familiarity of dumplings like Xiao Mian, Gyoza, or Mandu, but with a tantalizing twist - a burst of Indian spices and herbs that sets them apart.

On my culinary expeditions, I indulged in both the beef Momo in gravy and the steamed version. Each bite was a revelation. The steamed beef Momos, paired with their unique dipping sauces - the creamy avocado mayo, zesty spicy mayo, and the fiery hot sauce - are irresistible, especially when you combine the spicy mayo and hot sauce. The Momos are exceptionally filling, with perfectly seasoned meat inside a delicate wrapper. And the gravy? It's so sumptuous that I couldn't help but savor every last drop.

The only touch I miss is a traditional chutney, but that's more of a wish than a complaint. You can choose from beef, chicken, or veggie options, and you'll find the prices are a steal, ranging from $6-9. The man behind the truck is a gem, adding warmth to the already excellent food experience. 

So, if you're in the mood for something different and delicious without breaking the bank, this Momo truck is where it's at. Go, eat, and enjoy - it's an experience you'll want to repeat.",1
16386,"Title: A Cozy Gem Perfect for Pre-Theater Dining

I stumbled upon this charming spot on a Wednesday evening before catching a Broadway show, and it turned out to be a delightful surprise. Despite not having a reservation, my companion and I were promptly seated, with the service proving to be remarkably swift. The waiter was knowledgeable, confidently confirming that the falafel was indeed gluten-free among other menu inquiries.

The restaurant itself is on the smaller side, which creates a cozy atmosphere yet may not be suitable for large parties. It's adorned with cute decor, contributing to the inviting ambiance. I found the digital menus to be a modern touch while still retaining the personal service of ordering through the waiter.

The portions served are generous considering the price, and the quality of the ingredients left a notable impression on my palate. My only tinge of regret was skipping dessert, a mistake I plan to rectify on a future visit. For anyone in need of a quick bite or in the mood for Mediterranean fare, I'd heartily recommend this delightful establishment.",1
18231,"I had a delightful dining experience at this restaurant, where I stopped by for lunch on a Saturday. The service was prompt and attentive; I was seated as soon as I arrived. I ordered the XL xiao long bao, and the staff courteously informed me of a 20-minute wait for the freshly prepared soup dumplings. True to their word, the dumplings were served on time and were absolutely delicious. The combination of good dumplings and good service made for a memorable meal. Highly recommended for a satisfying dumpling fix!",1
19704,"I've been a regular at this gem of a restaurant for years and it's always a pleasure. The food never disappoints, and the service is consistently great. On my latest visit, the Beef Bourguignon was outstanding - the short rib meat fell apart at the slightest touch, a testament to its tenderness. The Halibut also impressed with its flavors and quality. The only minor flaw was the side of Brussels sprouts; although tasty with the addition of honey and sunflower seeds, they were a tad greasy from frying. Despite this, the overall experience was fantastic as usual.",1
11636,"Around Wall Street there aren't a lot choices for dinner, so we opted for scenic over variety. We were pleased with our choice as Trinity Place has a fun feel and solid food.Asbother reviews have pointed out, you're actually dining inside an old bank vault, from the heyday of Wall Street. The place has a classy feel and the service extends the feeling that you're at a special place.As anyone who reads my reviews knows, I am a sucker for Chicken Liver Pate. And this appetizer here does not disappoint. Served with a side of sourdough and things like pickles, olives and microgreens, this is a must  have, whether you're are a Chicken Liver Pate fan or not.The entrees, while solid, lacked the flavor anond richness of the first course. The organic Sal served atop a mixture of potatoes in a sauce was fine, but the fish seemed to be an after thought. Likewise the Chicken Under a Brick was nicely presented, but didnt have flavoring that set it apart from chicken dishes elsewhere.A nice place to try, especially if you're wanting a destination to feel well taken care of.",0
10984,"Title: A Disappointing Visit to Casa Nonna

Despite the high expectations set by the comforting notion of a Nonna's abundant feast, Casa Nonna left me unsatisfied. The quality of food did not compensate for the meager portions. Starting with a creamy butternut squash soup, I found some solace, but the side of broccoli rabe lacked the flavorful punch I'm accustomed to in homemade versions.

The main disappointment came with the Siamese Agnolotti pasta. The dish, boasting veal ragu and truffled pecorino, promised complexity but delivered a rather tepid experience both in taste and quantity. It was an underwhelming eight ravioli parcels that left the table as quickly as they arrived.

In contrast, the meatball Panini my wife ordered was a better choice, with a blend of provolone and mozzarella that outshone my bland pasta. Similarly, the margarita pizza ordered by my sister-in-law offered a more enjoyable flavor profile.

However, the pricing at Casa Nonna could not be overlooked. Even by NYC standards, charging $17 for a meatball sandwich, $10 for a modest serving of broccoli rabe, $15 for pizza, and $26 for a pasta dish that would leave a bird hungry seems steep.

My recommendation to friends and family visiting NYC would be to bypass Casa Nonna. There are far more restaurants in the city that truly honor the spirit of a Nonna's generous table.",1
1893,"Title: A Tale of Samosas and Dosas in Manhattan

Having visited this gem nestled in the bustling heart of Manhattan 2-3 times, I have developed a fondness for certain items on their menu. The star of the show remains the samosas, which are a must-try and earn a well-deserved 4.5/5 from me for their perfect blend of flavor and crispiness.

On my latest visit, I decided to venture out and try the Mysore masala dosa. Unfortunately, the dosa didn't quite hit the mark, scoring a mere 2/5. It was a letdown, primarily because it wasn't accompanied by the cherished red tomato sauce that I've always enjoyed.

The tea, much like the dosa, was underwhelming. It was a standard affair and gets an average rating of 3/5. Nothing to write home about, but it did the job.

On the bright side, the portion sizes continue to please and get a high 4.5/5, ensuring you get good value for your money. Speaking of value, the pricing at this establishment is unbeatable, earning a full 5/5.

In conclusion, while the samosas will continue to draw me back with their delightful taste and generous portions, I'll be steering clear of the dosas on future visits. Overall, it's a mixed bag but worth a visit for the samosas alone.",1
11198,"I recently visited a local eatery and decided to try their egg wrap with ground beef, which disappointingly turned out to be an underwhelming experience. Firstly, the seasoning was overwhelming, and the dish was excessively salty, making it a chore to eat. For a price tag exceeding ten dollars, one would expect not only quality but also quantity, both of which were lacking in this instance. Additionally, the texture of the wrap left much to be desired; it was soggy and lacked the firmness one would anticipate in a well-prepared wrap. Overall, the meal failed to deliver a pleasant dining experience and did not justify its cost.",1
18411,"I recently dined at Gyu-Kaku and found the experience underwhelming, particularly in comparison to the authentic Korean BBQ offerings in K-town. The chain's inflexible policies, such as not seating incomplete parties, only offering happy hour prices at the bar, and requiring large groups to navigate a preset menu process, make for a less than accommodating experience.

Service was lackluster—self-grilling notwithstanding, as it took multiple requests to obtain basic items like water. The meal proved to be expensive, averaging around $60 per person, yet the portion sizes within the ""packages"" left us feeling unsatisfied. Given that, it’s hard to justify the cost when one can enjoy larger portions, superior quality, and better service at a local Korean BBQ spot in K-town. Unfortunately, Gyu-Kaku isn't a restaurant I'd revisit or recommend.",1

The food here is solid, although there are probably better (and perhaps more authentic) dim sum places out there, too. Nevertheless, we had a wonderful meal, and you can't beat the upscale ambiance here, especially for being located in a touristy hub like Times Square!",0
1442,"Tucked away in the Old City, this Chinese gem is worth a visit even with Chinatown just a stone's throw away. The restaurant boasts ample seating and masters the art of Szechuan spice. Expect generous servings ideal for sharing – a big plus for family dining.

Their Spicy Wonton may be heavy on the wrapping, but it's an enjoyable vessel for the flavorful Szechuan oil, with decent meat stuffing. The Dan Dan Noodles are mixed for you, which might be a hit or miss depending on your preference for interactive dining. Nevertheless, the balance of heat from the spices with the creamy peanut sauce is commendable, despite leaning towards the peanutty side for my taste. Overall, a must-visit for those craving authentic Szechuan cuisine with a hearty serving style.",1
10872,"I had one of the BEST MEALS I have ever had at this tiny little French spot! I've been here before they changed their name and their kind manager Miki invited me for a meal to try their new menu, more similar to Boucherie (their big sister restaurant)In loooooove with this spot. I brought my boyfriend here for our last date night before I moved to Spain for a few months and it was so special and romantic, accompanied by our favourite cuisine, French! To start, we got two drinks. I got the Wildflower, a very tasty fruity drink that certainly packed a punch! Strong but delicious. My boyfriend opted for the Franco Mexican War and liked it a lot too!For apps we got the escargot which was hot and delicious and bubbly with butter! Perfect app. Also we got the steak tartare which is simply to die for. Must get these both!Our entrees blew us away with how delicious and well prepared they were. I got the chateaubriand with the best mashed potatoes, sauce and sauteed spinach ever. Ugh my mouth is still watering. He got the Steak Frites & while it was delicious he even admitted mine was better! For dessert we split the crème brûlée and both got an espresso martini! Absolutely incredible meal and I think the Boucherie team is one of the strongest in NYC! Love love love & will be back so soon",0

13866,"Title: Fresh Flavors with a DIY Twist at Local Taco Spot

I ventured into a bustling two-story culinary gem where the ground floor buzzed with takeaway action, and a serene dining experience awaited upstairs. Opting for the lunch special, the charm of the place instantly hit when I was prompted to pencil in my choices on a provided sheet - a quirk that set a lighthearted tone.

The offering was straightforward: $15 for a choice between a pair of tacos with a side of salad or rice or a triple taco treat. I kicked off with the standard chips and guac, delighting in the chunky avocado texture.

The short rib taco was a standout - the meat was succulent, well-seasoned, and delectable. The pulled pork taco didn't lag far behind, presenting a harmonious blend of flavors that satisfied the taste buds. However, the cod fish taco, while flavorful, paled in comparison. The fish was modest in size, making it less value-packed than its meaty counterparts.

In summary, the restaurant offered a delightful mix of sweet and savory in every bite, wrapped in a casual yet creative atmosphere. While the fish could be bypassed for more substantial options, the culinary experience was well-rounded and worth a visit for taco enthusiasts.",1

I've frequented this establishment on multiple occasions and it continually surpasses my expectations. The service and food consistently earn a score of 10 out of 10 in my book.

11825,"Title: A Hidden Gem Serving Delectable Korean Delights

I recently visited a quaint Korean restaurant that might just be the perfect spot for those seeking authentic and indulgent flavors. Despite its compact menu, each dish was a culinary delight, making reservations a smart move to avoid disappointment.

Our table enjoyed the refreshing scallops, dressed in a zesty vinaigrette priced at $21. The Jang Jo Rim, at $17, featured beef shank so tender it practically melted in the mouth. Another standout was the $35 oxtail soup, brimming with flavor and hearty root vegetables.

However, the true star of our meal was the unique honey butter chip ice cream for $16. This inventive dessert combined the crunch of crispy, homemade spicy potato chips with smooth vanilla ice cream, creating a sweet and savory harmony that rounded off our dining experience perfectly.

In short, this restaurant is an absolute must-visit for those who appreciate Korean cuisine with a twist. The honey butter chip ice cream alone is worth the trip!",1

3557,"Title: A Hearty BBQ Haven in the Heart of Manhattan

Finding a spot for affordable BBQ in Manhattan can be a tall order, but Brother Jimmy's BBQ proves to be a delightful exception. The platter option is my go-to, offering a generous protein choice with two sides, plus the staple cornbread and pickles, all at a wallet-friendly price.

On my visit, I chose the Northern Style Ribs, accompanied by Grilled Mac & Cheese, Hand Cut French Fries, and the customary cornbread and pickles. The ribs were succulent, the fries perfectly crisp, and the cornbread was the comforting touch needed to round out the meal. However, the Grilled Mac & Cheese was a bit of a letdown, lacking the rich flavor and creamy satisfaction I typically crave from BBQ joints.

Despite the mac & cheese not meeting my high expectations, Brother Jimmy's BBQ is still a solid choice when craving BBQ in the city. It's a place where the portions are hearty, and the prices are gentle on your finances – a combination that's hard to beat.",1
10139,"After a weary journey back from Puerto Rico, I found solace at Mama's just before they closed. Despite the late hour, I was able to indulge in two sumptuous Sicilian slices. The first, adorned with pepperoni, was a crunchy, doughy wonder with a robust sauce that was a touch too high on sodium for my taste. The second slice upped the ante with pepperoni cups, adding an extra dimension of flavor. I'm eager to return to Mama's, not only for another taste but also to determine if the high sodium was a one-off or a recipe staple. For those sensitive to salt, take note, but don't let it stop you from enjoying what could be a perfect slice.",1

15745,"Title: A Pleasant Surprise at Dynasty Dim Sum

I recently stopped by Dynasty Dim Sum for a spur-of-the-moment brunch and walked away quite satisfied. Tucked conveniently within walking distance of my hotel, this dim sum spot saved me a trip to Chinatown and offered a delectable variety on its menu.

Upon entering around noon on a Saturday, I was greeted by a half-full restaurant—a welcome sight for a peaceful meal. I immediately gave in to nostalgia and ordered the radish cakes, which were delightfully authentic and comforting. The BBQ pork matcha buns were a novel choice for me, and while delicious, I found myself wishing for a more generous helping of filling. The complimentary Hello Kitty buns, a reward for checking in, ended the meal on a whimsical and sweet note, though they were more of a photo-op than a must-have for me.

Service was a high point—attentive without being intrusive. The bill came to roughly $17 post-tip, which is reasonable for Kips Bay, considering the convenience and quality.

Overall, Dynasty Dim Sum is a solid choice for those in the area craving dim sum without the commute.",1
17278,"Amazing, cheesy goodness! My favorite was the smoked brisket and chimichurri melt. It was packed with tender brisket and the chimichurri was so flavorful. I got a side of cabbage slaw and highly recommend it, because the crunchiness of the cabbage really complemented the sandwich. The chicken bacon ranch wasn't as tasty as the brisket, but it stood out in terms of texture because of the perfectly crispy fried chicken! They both came out fresh and piping hot, although the wait time was shockingly short. The shakes were also delicious; rich, creamy, and indulgent. They were super sweet, so I would recommend getting one to share between two unless you really like your sweets. Overall, I was really impressed with the sandwiches and the super quick service!",0

The menu looked very hipster/ nontraditional  and the ambiance felt like a Wagamama restaurant (British-Japanese fusion chain restaurant with mediocre food). I had low expectations for the ramen but don't judge a book by its cover. I had the bold ramen with an extra kick of spice and the broth was pretty ""bold"" and rich. It was actually a little too spicy for me but it wasn't too crazy. There was decent topping of pork slices and the soft boiled egg was cook nicely. The noodles were cooked just right, not too soft and with a slight bouncey texture. They were a bit stingy with the scallions. I wanted extra scallions but it was just a sprinkle. I also got extra garlic but they were all at the bottom of the bowl. I didn't realize until I was almost done with my meal. I would come here again with friends and coworkers. Not bad, not bad!",0

16337,"I wanted to love this place as a good alternative to Totto or Ippudo. But it's a distant third option, based on the meat being chewy and the broth being average. Not a bad bowl of ramen but definitely not on the same tier as the other famous noodle joints in midtown/Hell's Kitchen. The creativity is what would make me come back. There is a mashed potato topping which intrigued me and also slightly scared me. Plenty of vegetarian options which helps, and almost a dozen appetizer options to supplement your bowl. And the music is eclectic urban pop and hip hop, which is not too overbearing in the cozy narrow space it inhabits.I'll try this place again but I won't crave it like my beloved totto or Ippudo ramens.",0
2361,"This place is a little hidden and at first glance you might mistaken it for the bar or wannabe beer garden that's part of the Wyndham hotel. (Hey, Brooklyn called and wants their hipster beer garden name back.)It's a small place but I came here with friends when they just opened so we had no trouble snagging a table right away. The menu is short and sweet and offers the usual fare you see at a ramen joint. They do have happy hour drink specials (buy one get one half off).We ordered a few appetizers to share and we each ordered a ramen.Shishito peppers - Tasty and perfectly charred without being cooked to death. Seriously, you can not go wrong with this unless you happen to eat the spicy bastard pepper.Pork belly bao - SO tasty it was devoured in less than 30 seconds. We were hungry, please don't judge us.Wagyu skewers - Super yummy! Grilled to perfection and melts in your mouth. I could eat 20 of those... and probably OD on meat.Lobster tacos - The first bite tasted good and then not so good afterwards? Honestly the dressing with the slaw was too sour and it threw the whole taco off for us. All 3 of us agreed it was too sour or too much lime?RAMEN:I've had Bone marrow ramen from a few places now (Queens, Brooklyn, Manhattan) and Shinka can definitely hold it's own!Rich flavorful broth - checkChewy but not soggy noodles - checkTender and flavorful Cha su pork - checkGood fatty bone marrow - checkThe only thing I didn't like about my ramen was the extra bamboo shoot I added. Unlike other ramen places where they give you slices, this place gives you a whole damn shoot which is slippery as all hell. The taste, slightly sweet, like it's been marinated just didn't go well with all the savory goodness my bone marrow ramen had to offer. My sister had the spicy pork ramen and her only complaint was that it wasn't spicy enough. I tried some and it was perfect for me because I'm such a weak sauce when it comes to scoville level.Overall, a great ramen place in busy chinatown. The service was friendly and our server was attentive. The bathroom situation (located in the sub basement) is a little sketchy but that's more the hotel's fault than the restaurants. I look forward to coming back and trying the other ramen Shinka has to offer.",0
20871,"Very nice place. Three of us came for my husband's birthday brunch. Food was very good and portions were very generous. The menu selection is huge and service is very good as well. I got crab Benedict and it was very tasty. Everyone was satisfied with the food. It did not take long to get food. Also, they have fresh squeezed juices. I definitely recommend this place.",0
16550,"Title: A Satisfactory Feast at an AYCE Hotpot Haven

Last night, a group of six of us descended upon a local all-you-can-eat hotpot spot, curious to test the breadth of their culinary offerings. Despite arriving later than our reservation time, I was pleasantly surprised to find my party already comfortably seated, an accommodation not always guaranteed at other establishments.

Our collective appetite had zeroed in on hotpot, and while the option to mix and match with barbecue was available, we committed solely to the steamy pots. The restaurant caters to groups with large duo/trio pots, but we opted for individual hotpots for a more personalized experience. This decision proved convenient, allowing each of us to tailor our dishes without engaging in an over-the-table reach.

On a flavor note, the experience was moderately impressive. Although my friends with a penchant for heat found the ma la broth lacking in its promised fiery kick, a request for additional peppers swiftly remedied this.

Service was a minor hiccup in the evening's flow. It bore the hallmarks of typical AYCE strategy, with occasional lapses in the delivery of our ordered items. Particularly, if you’re eager to sample their premium options that come with an added cost, vigilance is recommended to ensure each request reaches your table.

Price-wise, at approximately $33 per person for dinner, I would argue there’s little competition within the city for unlimited hotpot of this caliber. While service could be more attentive, the affordability and eventual satisfaction make it a spot worth visiting for those with a hearty appetite. We all walked out full, with wallets just as content as our stomachs.",1
15950,"I recently dined at a restaurant that boasted a good vibe, but I found the prices to be steep for the experience provided. Main dishes were priced over $25, and drinks started at $14, which set my expectations high. While the food and drinks were solid, they did not hit the mark of 5-star quality that one would anticipate at such price points. The portion sizes and the quality of food, although decent, did not justify the premium cost. Despite the pleasant atmosphere, the value for money was not quite there. I might consider giving their other location a try, but I'm unlikely to make this establishment the centerpiece of my future plans; it's more suited as a stop-over option rather than a destination in itself.",1
2200,"I really like this place. It's a relaxed, yet a lil fancy French restaurant in a location without many of them around. You can get full service at the bar that allows you a good view of the place and outside. The cocktails are pretty good, but I haven't found one I really like yet.- duck foie gras pate: I loved that this has a generous portion size. Great flavor and the bread is toasted perfectly! There is more pate than bread so make sure you order something else to go with the pate unless you wanna eat half of it plain.- beef tartare: unfortunately a miss for me, the flavor is overwhelmed with paprika in my opinion- beef rib: soooo good, falls off the bone, melts in your mouth, amazing flavors! The whipped mustard it comes with is really great too, not the usual preparation of mustard and I much prefer this! The veggies are soft and well-stewed.Overall, I like the ambience and food is generally high quality. I find it a little pricey but worth it for the quality. Cash-only which is unfortunate.",0
19326,"Title: A Buzzing Spot with Room for Improvement

My experience at this bustling eatery was a mixed bag. Despite the popularity of the restaurant, I suggest securing a reservation to avoid a lengthy wait. The seating was cramped, particularly next to the kitchen where the constant bustle can lead to frequent jostles.

The menu featured a variety of Italian staples. The most innovative dish was a whole roasted eggplant served tableside, though its charred skin and mushy texture fell short of expectations. The burrata was passable, but the bruschetta was disappointingly simplistic.

An eyebrow-raising observation was the pre-packaged spaghetti spotted in the kitchen. However, the Spaghetti Limone redeemed itself with its robust flavor. The Chicken Parmesan was unremarkable, and while the pizzas—the Vodka and Margherita—had a pleasing soft and chewy dough, they were dough-heavy and scant on sauce.

The ambiance of the restaurant did carry a certain charm, but overall, the discomfort and average fare make a return visit unlikely.",1
18987,"During a stroll through Chinatown, with a hankering for something soupy to quench my hunger, I serendipitously came across a cozy noodle spot boasting hand-rolled noodles. My curiosity piqued, I wondered if it could match the beef noodle soup I savored in Taipei. To my delight, it nearly hit the mark. The beef tendon soup was a savory treat! Not only was it delectable, but it also came with a budget-friendly price tag. Such a gem for thrifty food lovers seeking authentic Chinese fare! I'm already planning a return visit for their celebrated dumplings. NYC has certainly proven its prowess in offering quality eats at a steal. A minor quibble: the $15 minimum for credit card payments. Otherwise, this place is a true find for those looking for excellent value.",1
10913,"Contra, nestled in a tiny little space on Orchard Street, was truly a wonderful fine dining experience without the stuffiness of most Michelin star restaurants. They had no more availability on my boyfriend's birthday but were able to accommodate us for the night. They actually only had the option of the tasting menu (for a very reasonable $89) so you can't order a la crate. We added on the beverage pairing. Here's how it went:Lobster chip - so delicious, a really great start to the journeyScallop and radishes - this was interesting, but definitely not my favoriteFresh tofu - omg, I never thought i would love tofu so much. The flavors here were complex but so perfectly balancedWhite asparagus - I had never tried white asparagus but this was great and came in a sour mustardy sort of wineMonkfish - the flavors of this fish were very delicate and did not overpower the taste of this fishVeal - wowow, this was delicious. Super tender and full of flavorCheese pairing - very good cheese, soft almost Brie-likeBlood orange - very refreshing but very blandHazelnut dessert - omg the chocolate and the hazelnut worked so perfect together and came with some sort of gummy-like topping. Definitely my favorite thing of the night Bread - honorable mention because this bread was gooooooodOverall, a really good experience. The staff was very attentive and did a great job of walking through all the dishes. It did feel a bit rushed though, we were in and out in less than 2 hours.",0
18340,"Angelo's is fabulous. I love the pizza--the pasta is good too. And the service is always good when I go. When you walk in it might look like a small restaurant space but there is seating upstairs. If you are coming with a large group, I recommend calling ahead if it's around dinner time---it does get crowded.",0
14800,"Came here on a Sunday afternoon for brunch, it's a pretty spacious restaurant and gets busy in the summer because they have a nice outdoor area. If you need a spot for a big group brunch this a good place to try. The food is moderately priced and pretty decent -- nothing to write home about but good. I got their salmon eggs Benedict (comes with super tasty buttery potatoes) and the cinnamon raisin French toast (wish the bread was fluffier).",0
2248,"Title: A Belated Valentine's Feast of Flavors

I recently dined at this highly recommended spot, a few days post-Valentine’s Day, eager to bask in a happy hour I’d heard so much about. Our visit wasn't timed for that special pricing, but the patio ambiance didn't disappoint.

We started off with two types of sangrias - a peachy blanca for myself and a classic tinta for my partner. Both were delightful, packed with fresh fruit, and surprisingly potent for our now modest alcohol tolerance.

The food journey began with jamon serrano and an egg omelet special - both of which were decent but didn’t quite leave a lasting impression. Patata bravas sadly fell into the 'forgettable' category due to its starchy blandness. 

However, the true stars of the meal were the stuffed dates, which despite a no-substitution policy on the blue cheese, pleasantly surprised us with its mildness. The harmony of sweet dates and salty bacon was absolutely delectable. Similarly, croquettes (flavors elude me) were a hit with their rich, savory stuffing - both dishes meriting a future reorder.

Our evening concluded with stuffed churros oozing with dulce de leche, satisfying our sweet tooth with a warm, gooey finish. Utilizing an Amex deal sweetened the deal further, shaving $20 off our bill.

To our amazement, we left the restaurant comfortably full - a testament to the satiating power of well-crafted tapas. Despite the rush of life dimming some details, the highs of the meal were unforgettable.",1
14467,"My bf and I went on a food adventure during our last full day in NY. We were actually at Russ and daughters and the wait was sooo long that we decided to look on yelp to see what was nearby. We were being fatties and decided to walk over to Prince to get pizza before we went back to Russ and Daughters for bagels LOL. The line was pretty long but it went by quick, we ordered 2 square slices of the pepperoni. The pizza was piping hot and they weren't skimpy on the pepperoni either. The sauce ratio was perfect and I thought the pizza was good. The pizza is a thick crust, not a traditional NY thin crust pizza. My boyfriend really liked it and said it was his favorite pizza in NY but my personal preference is thin crust.",0
293,"I stopped by for a quick taco fix before a friends' meetup and wasn't disappointed by the taste – these tacos are indeed top-notch. However, the midtown premium is hard to ignore. Shelling out nearly $4 for a taco that rivals the flavors and authenticity of a street vendor at half the cost left me questioning the value. Great for a splurge, but for regular taco runs, my wallet would prefer the food truck.",1
1271,"Not really sure why the hostess made me join the waitlist and then tell me 2 seconds later there's an available table. I got the bone marrow ramen and my boyfriend got the Shinka tonkatsu. We also got a bowl of edamame for checking in and it was a generous amount of slightly salted hot edamame. So the bone marrow ramen is a tiny half sliced bone marrow. You can't really taste too much of the bone marrow because the garlic slices in the bowl are very rich and powering but in a good way. For the garlic, not the bone marrow. I wish the bone marrow seeped more into the broth to create a richer broth. Also i added an egg but half my egg was submerged into the ramen and losing its yolk :( The Shinka tonkatsu broth was light at first sip but a strong hit of saltiness towards the end so I was surprised and preferred the bone marrow broth more. It is a small spot inside the Wyndham garden hotel and I noticed there was a bathroom by the elevators.",0
14898,"Title: High Hopes Dashed at By Chloe near MacDougal

After years of anticipation, I finally paid a visit to By Chloe, situated nostalgically near my old college apartment. The eatery presented a neat atmosphere with a friendly staff and the convenience of a restroom, which frankly were the high points that saved it from a single star.

I opted for the much-touted mac and cheese with shiitake mushroom ""bacon"". The presentation was pleasing, but the taste was a letdown - lackluster with an unexpected sweetness and an overall dry texture. The shiitake ""bacon"" added a salty kick, yet it couldn't redeem the dish which I sadly tossed aside mostly uneaten.

The spicy quinoa taco salad, recommended by my vegan circle, was a disappointment both in flavor balance and value. It lacked the robustness expected from its cost, predominantly filled with romaine and chips. Although the avocado and tofu cream provided some solace, the faux taco meat was overwhelmingly spicy, leading to another unfinished meal.

Would I return? Doubtful. Non-vegan friends have suggested other menu items like the burger and meatball sandwich, but I'm inclined to stick to authentic versions since I'm not vegan. For those curious about By Chloe, temper your expectations - the fare here won't satisfy if you're comparing it to traditional counterparts.",1
19652,They never disappoint. The steaks always come out perfect no matter how you like it. The servers are super nice and they let you take your time. They help with serving the food as well. The steaks are huge and they cut it up in slices for ease.,0
18214,"Title: Carnivore's Delight at Phatt Girl Heaven

My experience at Phatt Girl Heaven can only be described as an absolute joy from beginning to end. Kicking things off with Happy Hour at the bar, my friend and I sipped on a decent Malbec before hunger struck. Moving to the dining area, it quickly became apparent that this place is a meat lover's paradise. Straightforward and delicious—meat on the fire, meat in your mouth!

But it's not all about the protein; they've got your veggies covered too for those who appreciate a more balanced plate. The sides were a highlight with standout offerings like eggs, cheesy corn, and kimchi—each dish complementing the hearty meats perfectly.

Service? Spot-on. The staff struck the right balance of friendliness and professionalism, adding to the relaxed ambiance. I'm already planning my next visit, although my waistline might have some reservations. Two thumbs up for Phatt Girl Heaven!",1
17119,"After hearing about the fancy opaque chopsticks from friends (who also didn't have to journey to flushing for dry pot), I was excited to try mala project finally! I went on a Tuesday night in January,  7:30 reservation for a group of 4.Pros:- nice atmosphere! Very relaxed and trendy, with nice staff and decor, restrooms, utensils etc- cocktails were yummy. My friends enjoyed their moscow slings - we ordered two baskets - the spicy one was spicy!! Next day was rough if you know what I mean. Chug a glass of milk after or buy some bubble tea to mitigate the after effects!!!- ingredients were up to par. Fresh and they had a nice variety with red chilis, peppercorns, oil, etc evenly mixed throughout the entire bowl. Definitely worth going here if you've never had dry pot!Cons:- I'm accounting for the staff wages, probably through the roof rent, bar license, taxes, workers Comp, etc etc - everything that costs a business a LOT these days. But damn... $5 for 4 slices of spam and $4 for a few chunks of mushrooms really hurt my soul! My parents would not step foot in a place that charges $5-8 for basic ingredients, hah, and they would go ""I can buy and cook this for you fools for $2.75!!!"" Overall, worth visiting for a nice dry pot dinner out with nicely crafted cocktails! Would I come back here if I had friends in town who love spicy food and wanted to try dry pot? Most likely. But to get my quick cheap dry pot fix I'll stick to flushing food court until then!",0
20170,"I recently visited this much-hyped brunch spot, lured by the promise of an outstanding meal after enduring the notorious wait times. Regrettably, the experience fell flat. The service was commendable, but the food did not live up to the high expectations set by enthusiastic reviews. My friend found her corn beef hash acceptable but not remarkable, while my lobster linguini left much to be desired. The dish was underwhelming in flavor, and the addition of a crunchy green topping was more akin to an unwelcome garnish of sand, detracting from the meal rather than enhancing it. I abandoned over half of my plate, preferring not to squander calories on such an uninspired offering.

It seems the restaurant's allure may be more about the ambiance and ticking a box in one's NYC dining checklist than the culinary experience. For those in search of truly delectable fare, I'd suggest looking elsewhere.",1

Some of the better scallion pancakes I've tried in the city!Vegetable lo mein & dumpling sampler - Very solid dishes, although I can't say that they were particularly unique. Still well-executed!Fried rice - Yum! I'm not usually a huge rice person, but I was a huge fan of this fried rice. Would actually order this again!Chilean sea bass - Probably my favorite entree of the night! The fish was very well-cooked, and I loved the black bean sauce in particular!Drunken sea bass - Super unique; liked how the sauce had a bit of a sweet kick.Kung Pao chicken - Props to Phillipe Chow; normally I've found that kung pao chicken at these types of restaurants are barely even a tiny bit spicy. These, however, had more than a bit of a kick to it - A+! Crispy duck - I don't eat duck so I can't say much regarding the flavor, but others at my table gave rave reviews!Fortune cookie red velvet cake - Given it's restaurant week, the kitchen first sent out the wrong size cake (as we had ordered a full size one and not the smaller one that comes with the restaurant week meal), but then sent out the correct one. So basically we got almost double the cake! The full sized one shined, as it had 3 layers of red velvet cake (vs 1) and 2 fortune cookies on top instead of 1!Great meal and service all around; my main complaint is that the music is very loud, so this probably isn't the place to go if you're looking to have a lot of conversation. Still worth a visit for the food!",0

10285,"Title: A Gem of Italian Charm on the Upper East Side

Nestled in the heart of the Upper East Side, Firenze continues to captivate diners with its enchanting new location that somehow grows more charming with each visit. This longstanding Italian favorite effortlessly combines sumptuous cuisine, attentive service, and a cornucopia of delightful details, making it an ideal spot for a romantic evening or a comfortable gathering with loved ones.

The friendly owner is the lifeblood of the restaurant, consistently mingling with guests and overseeing operations to ensure an exceptional dining experience. It's a testament to the tenacity and passion that define New York City's dining scene. Having flourished through adversity – from the disarray of Second Avenue's subway construction to the tribulations of a fire at their previous establishment – the owner's resilience shines through in each lovingly placed flower planter that adorns the exterior.

Firenze's menu is a marvel of authentic Italian flavors, with each dish presented as a work of art. The garlic-laden, spiced olive oil is an exquisite accompaniment to their flawless focaccia bread, making carb counting a distant afterthought. The tomato and mozzarella dish is a creamy delight, while the beef carpaccio is nothing short of extraordinary. Their grilled octopus skewers, harmonized with a light, arugula salad, stand out as a delectable two-in-one starter.

The seafood over black linguini is the star of the show – a divine symphony of lobster, clams, mussels, and calamari that never fails to amaze. Moreover, the lamb chops, accompanied by fresh, perfectly cooked vegetables, are a testament to the kitchen's prowess.

The beverage selection is equally impressive, with a variety of wines that satisfy and an after-dinner treat of lemoncello, Sambuca (complete with the traditional three beans), and, for those special occasions, a complimentary amaretto.

Firenze is more than just a restaurant; it's a heartfelt story of perseverance and dedication. It's a place where the city's love affair with great food and charming ambiance becomes a reality. Highly recommended for anyone looking to sprinkle some Italian romance into their dining experience.",1
19485,"Title: A Cozy Valentine's Delight at [Restaurant Name]

From the moment we arrived for our 6:30pm Valentine's Day dinner—early at 6pm, to our luck and surprise—we were swept into the warm embrace of [Restaurant Name]. A bustling yet casual atmosphere made for the perfect backdrop for either a laid-back date or a friendly gathering.

Heed this: reservations are a must during peak times, as the popular spot was packed until close, and it's not ideal for groups larger than 8 due to space constraints. Yet, amidst the buzz, the service shone—attentive and unhurried, our waiter made us feel valued, even offering an extra complimentary Turkish tea with a Yelp check-in, a charming Valentine's gesture.

The culinary highlight was undoubtedly the $22 Iskender— a hearty, savory feast that's ample for two. Sizzling lamb atop fragrant tomato sauce and Turkish bread, kept delectably warm on a metal platter, defied my pet peeve of cold dishes, maintaining its mouthwatering magic throughout.

To cleanse our palate, the $8 almond pudding offered a soothing, subtly sweet finale.

Echoing my friend's recommendation, [Restaurant Name] lived up to its reputation with heartwarming food and experience worth revisiting. Next time? More menu exploration awaits!",1
20520,"What lies behind a beautiful wooden door, on a cute little corner on Christopher Street is Petite Boucherie - the smaller, but more quaint of the Boucherie restaurants. Here, fine dining meets cozy and classic. This simple space was an old coffee shop that was transformed, so although there is limited seating, it works to the restaurant's advantage. While dining on delicious French cuisine, you feel as if you are dining in intimacy. The atmosphere is really quite elegant for a small space. On a normal Tuesday night, the manager walked around and warmly greeted each patron, striking up stories of the foundation of the restaurant. He personally oversaw the business and made sure everything was running smoothly.There are no words to describe the deliciousness of the dishes. The escargot was melt in your mouth butteriness. The steak tartare was fantastic. The filet mignon and rack of lamb were cooked to perfection, with a delicately crisped char. The creme brûlée was the best I've ever had. I left this restaurant glowing. This is the kind of place you come to with a significant other on a special night.

My friends and I snagged a last-minute spot at this lively eatery on a sun-soaked Saturday, and the staff shone as brightly as the day. The atmosphere hit just the right note of casual and trendy, setting the stage for an enjoyable experience.

The highlight, without a shadow of a doubt, was the bottomless mimosa offer—a real festive treat that kept our glasses perpetually sparkling. However, the culinary side didn't quite match up to the effervescent drinks; my chicken and waffles were a slight letdown with the chicken being a tad on the dry side and the waffles not served hot.

That said, the promise of endless mimosas would definitely lure me back for another round, especially with a group of friends in tow to toast to good times.",1
11621,"Izakaya MEW near the Empire State Building is a bustling hub with a reputation that precedes it - the long waits and massive Yelp following say it all. As part of a hospitality group known for quality eateries, its menu features Korean twists on Japanese classics. Our experience, however, was mixed.

Starting with the Tuna Tataki, it was enjoyable but the portion left us wanting. The Grilled Skewer Set hit the spot for my fiancé, though I found it a tad underwhelming in flavor and too lean for my liking, save for the chicken meatballs which stood out. The standout dish for us was the Kimchi Creme Udon - a perfectly spicy and addictive bowl I'd come back for.

The specialty rolls, unfortunately, didn't live up to our expectations. The Volcano and Mew Special rolls were lackluster, requiring an uncharacteristic dip in soy sauce to bring some life to them. The Mew Chicken was a redemption, with a well-balanced sweet and sour sauce and a delightful crunch. Fried Squid Legs were also on point, tender and not chewy at all.

Dessert was a high note, with the Yuzu Cheesecake impressing us, though we craved a larger slice. If I were to brave the wait again, I'd stick to the Kimchi Creme Udon and explore more fried dishes. Despite the hype, Izakaya MEW is a place where you can still find a good meal without breaking the bank - just be ready for that wait.",1
3376,"Title: A Hidden Gem for Korean Takeout

I recently visited a quaint Korean eatery known for its spicy pork dish, which did not disappoint. The meal was a vibrant tapestry of authentic flavors, balancing a generous proportion of meat and vegetables, topped with a fried egg over rice. Each bite left me more satisfied—and hotter—than the last.

This spot is primarily a takeout joint, with service to match. With no more than half a dozen seats, it's not the place for a leisurely sit-down meal, but it's perfect for a quick, fulfilling bite.

In terms of value, it's a steal. For under $11, I walked away both full and impressed by the quality, especially considering Korean cuisine's typical price points.

In summary, this restaurant is a go-to for anyone craving hearty Korean staples like bulgogi, spicy pork, and kimchi without breaking the bank. I'll definitely be coming back for more takeout.",1
20041,"We decided to dine in the lounge area rather than the dining area so we didn't need a reservation.  Still intimate with live music playing so that was a plus for us. Started out with some calamari and according to my husband it's the best he's ever had (and I promise you he gets calamari everywhere we go!). I also had the tuna tartare which was served with chips and was very tasty. I had the chopped salad to go with my filet and I absolute loved the dressing that was on it. My steak was cooked as ordered - Medium and was very flavorful (I judge this on whether I need steak sauce or not-and I didn't). The potatoes were good and come in shareable sizes so we ordered a couple sides amongst three of us and we had more than enough food since we ordered appetizers. Drinks were tasty and our waitress was super nice and down to earth. I am so glad a friend of mine recommended this place as our last place to dine while we were visiting NYC, it definitely ended our trip with a great meal!!!",0
20862,"Last night's dinner before catching a Sofar Show proved to be an experience worth sharing. The entry through a deli into a ""no entry employees only"" door was intriguing—almost like stepping into a speakeasy. Descending the stairs, we were greeted by a surprisingly large space, dimly lit for ambiance, complete with a bar and lounge area perfect for pre-dinner drinks.

A note of the downside: the tables were a bit too cozy for my liking, and ours had a precarious wobble. However, I must commend the staff for their quick and kind response to our table issues and their accommodating nature when a group requested more space.

Now, the highlight—food you'll want to order again (except for one miss). The traditional Elotes are a must-try; get one per person—trust me, no sharing. Tacos are a win here; between two of us, we split chicken, ribeye, and fish, and each was equally delectable. The Fried sweet plantains shouldn't be missed—my banana-averse boyfriend even gave them two thumbs up. For dessert, the Mexican lava cake was indulgent and generous with the ""lava,"" although the Tres Leches is next on my list.

The one letdown was the queso, a departure from the traditional—it solidified too quickly and was much too thick for my taste.

All in all, definitely worth a visit for anyone looking for an atmospheric dining experience coupled with some delightful bites.",1

10060,"L'Accolade is a tough nut to crack when it comes to a solid rating. While I’d love to throw an 8.5 out of 10 its way, four stars feel more fitting due to a few inconsistencies that held it back from its full potential.

The food is certainly the star at L'Accolade, with a menu that dazzles and delights in equal measure. From the Fluke Crudo to the Barbecued Carrot and the show-stopping Duck, each dish was a testament to the kitchen's flair for French-inspired cuisine that’s light yet deeply satisfying. The Steelhead Trout and Roasted Radish rounded out our meal with their refreshing tastes and delicate touches.

Complementing the culinary delights is a wine list that is a true treasure trove for oenophiles. Our server, despite being a bit of a will-o’-the-wisp, navigated us through an unforgettable wine journey that paired magnificently with our meal. Each recommendation was spot on, enhancing the dishes and enriching the overall dining experience.

On the flip side, the service was where L'Accolade lost a step. From an unclear server assignment to an almost indifferent approach to attending to our needs, the waiting game added a layer of confusion to the evening. Though there’s charm in the guessing game of who’s serving you, it’s a novelty that quickly wears thin.

The vibe of the place is exactly what you'd hope for in a West Village gem: intimate and unpretentious, with an industrial-chic decor that gives a cozy embrace. It’s an ideal spot for a date night that promises adventure without the extravagant cost.

In summary, L'Accolade charms with its food and wine but trips over its own service. Here’s to hoping they iron out these kinks because this spot has all the makings of a five-star experience.",1

I recently stumbled upon a delightful brunch spot in the heart of Tribeca, thanks to a Yelp discovery. The experience was nothing short of fantastic. The ambiance struck the perfect balance of modernity and rustic charm, with its subway-tiled, glass-enclosed space adorned with warm wooden touches, creating that quintessential Tribeca loft vibe. Their I Love NY mugs added a charming touch to the setting, especially while sipping on their perfectly crafted mimosas.

Both the food and drinks were impressive, showcasing quality and taste. The staff deserves a shoutout for their exceptional service; they were not only friendly but also incredibly helpful in guiding us through the menu choices.

For those concerned about parking, street options are available, though opting for Uber or public transportation might save you some hassle. This place is a must-visit for anyone in the vicinity looking for a top-notch New York brunch experience. Don't miss out on this Tribeca treasure!",1
12121,"Title: A Matcha-Infused Experience at a Bustling Spot

My friend and I recently dined at a popular restaurant that, despite being packed, seated us promptly—a pleasant surprise. We ventured into the matcha-themed menu, starting with the matcha IPA. I'm usually not a beer enthusiast, but found this one smooth, although the matcha flavor was subtle. Its dark green hue was quite the visual treat.

Our indulgence continued with the matcha lava dessert. The lava cake was a delightful fusion of melted chocolate and matcha, perfectly complemented by the accompanying matcha ice cream, which was a bit too intense for my preference due to its stronger matcha essence.

The ambiance was lively, and service was swift. I'm eager to return and dive into more of their dessert offerings. A lovely spot overall for those looking to explore matcha-infused creations.",1
17521,"I like this place in the city but I wish they change their menu once in a while. I have been coming to this place for a while now and everytime eating the same food gets boring. It's all you can eat place with amazing appetizers and entrees but by the time entrees is served I am almost full with the appetizers. I think you need a good appetite to get your money's worth here as it's $35 plus taxes per person without drinks! Definitely try the Taj Mahal or kingfisher in terms of beer if you wanna try Indian beer. But the last time when I had it, it was probably too much food and the drinks. The ambience and decor is amazing here which cannot match to any place in the city IMO. In terms of what we had for food the menu is fixed and you can lookup on the website to see it because it would take me forever to describe like 20+ items served. They do ask you for how spicy you want your entrees to be and in my opinion their Hot is not at all spicy for me. But I guess for general public I think Medium is a good spice level. They do have amazing Indian Chai at the end and yummy ice cream to end your dinner experience. P.S they are only open for dinner so plan accordingly and you can call them to make reservations without having to put your card information.",0
21034,"Title: An Evening of Ups and Downs at The Dining Spot

My visit to The Dining Spot for a Saturday dinner proved to be a mixed bag of surprises. Despite managing to snag a reservation for 9:45 pm, the strict dress code detailed on their website seemed to be more of a suggestion; guests were dressed in casual attire, contrary to the expected formality.

Seated two minutes ahead of schedule, the ambiance was inviting, and the booth seating provided a cozy atmosphere. The restaurant ran like a well-oiled machine, with staff members seamlessly managing their roles - from the hostess to the table attendants, each person contributed to a smooth dining experience.

The food, however, didn't quite hit the mark. I ordered a veggie burger paired with wine. Although the flavors were interesting, the burger's consistency disappointed as the patty was overly dense and crumbled easily, forcing me to resort to utensils. The accompanying fries were too thin for my liking, albeit beautifully presented with a choice of ketchup and spicy mayo.

An unexpected treat was the live jazz performance, adding a delightful touch to the evening's setting. While the veggie burger was a letdown, settling at 3/5, the overall dining experience, buoyed by the service and ambiance, earns a commendable 4/5.",1
3187,"Mimosas were cool, food was not great. I didn't think what I had was bad but I've definitely had better chicken and waffles. It costs $50 for both bottomless mimosas and an entree for brunch. The general vibe of the place was my favorite part. They had a DJ who was on point with all of his song selections AND he even took some requests. There is a 2 hour minimum for folks dining in, which they do try to stick to. I think we lost track of time at a certain point but they were extremely polite when asking us to leave. I'd come back strictly for the bottomless mimosas and music.",0
18871,"Balthazar is an excellent spot for fine French dining.The space has several old Parisian touches and is usually quite busy. Although the staff is dressed nicely, the vibe is more causal. It would be prudent to make a reservation before coming here.I dined here with a guest and, not surprisingly, over-indulged a bit. Our favorite appetizer we tried was the goat cheese caramelized tart. The escargot was tasty (though it was admittedly my first time trying it), as was the tartare, though it could have come with more/larger crostini.The entreés we tried were quite delectable. The duck confit was tender and juicy with each bite. I would highly recommend this dish.We also ordered the Coq au Vin that was basted in a delicious wine/garlic reduction. To top it off, for dessert we ate a delicious caramalized banana ricotta tart loaded with banana ice cream.As with most Frenchh restaurants, it is quite pricey. We definitely could have cut down on an app and perhaps split a cheaper bottle of wine instead of the individual drinks, but when in Paris.....",0
18245,"I've been meaning to try this place since it opened a couple of years ago (or so it seems). No wait to speak of on a Saturday night in August (is that good or bad??). Friendly staff. Menu is not extensive but seems reasonably authentic. Some of the entree prices are a bit lofty (north of $30), although there were a few salad options in the lower $20 range.Lobster taquitos starter was both crispy and creamy, albeit again a bit expensive at $21. Guacamole and chips solid, although a bit of a repeater! Monkfish was executed well, as was the warm farro with shrimp. There was some confusion around the branzino special: we were offered (and ordered) two sides. When everything arrived, we waited for the sides and finally inquired about them. Turns out, sides don't come with it. It's all good, though it would've been good to have been proactively told that instead of being left to decide if we ask about them or just let it go.Given the culinary wasteland that's called the UES, not bad. Probably a B+.",0
10798,"Had the pleasure to enjoy lunch with colleagues to kickoff the new year. Started off with complimentary pita and delicious housemade spread. We each took advantage of the lunch special. I really appreciated the octopus appetizer and was pleased with the orzo with ground beef. Considering the chill in the air, my orzo entree was hearty and heartwarming. What really excited me was the fish we decided to order for the table. Simply grilled branzino with olive oil and lemon on the side to dress it. The desserts were pleasant but nothing to write home about. The service however was indeed memorable. I had only visited once and would be eager to return. Next time I visit I'm diving straight into the seafood offerings.",0
16226,"Nice pub with great food and a casual, comfy atmosphere. We came here to watch a soccer game and have lunch, and we were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food and the courtesy of the staff (which I don't usually expect in a busy pub). Great job!",0

19720,"Solid diner in the UES that is open 24 hours. Whether you're looking for a late night snack after a night out or breakfast on a weekend, Ritz is a great spot for both!If you're coming on a weekend morning, it can get pretty busy around 10am so I always try to go earlier to beat any lines.The food is really good! I always get a Belgium waffle with strawberries (they load on the strawberries and they are fresh not frozen which is a plus). Fries are also really yummy! My bf likes the eggs benedict. Service is friendly/average so no disappointments there. Once you are finished you pay at the front so you do not have to wait for the waiter which is nice.",0
13526,"Tucked away in the bustling Flatiron district lies an eclectic gem blending Japanese chirashi with Hawaiian poke flair, complemented by a zesty Sriracha mayo twist. Although this fusion spot is a refreshing change from the standard grab-n-go lunch options in the area, be prepared for a premium price point that may not suit daily indulgence.

The space is cozy, often characterized by a snaking queue during peak hours, managed by a lean team of one chef and a cashier. Despite the wait, the dedication to quality is evident. The fish, meticulously filleted on-site, boasts undeniable freshness in both taste and aroma.

However, there's room for improvement, particularly with the rice presentation. Patrons have noted that if not consumed promptly, the rice tends to stubbornly cling to the paper bowls. A tweak in serving could enhance the overall enjoyment of these otherwise beautifully crafted bowls.",1
18523,"Title: A Cozy Lunch Haven North of Brookfield

On a dreary Monday afternoon, just a stone's throw north of the Brookfield, my dining companion and I sought refuge in a charming local eatery for a late lunch. The timing was impeccable, allowing us to slip in post-lunch rush, resulting in a serene atmosphere and our pick of the seating arrangements.

The first thing that struck us was the mountain of pizza boxes, a clear testament to the restaurant's reputed pizza prowess. However, we opted to diversify our palate by sampling a variety of dishes. Our selection included succulent mussels swimming in a divine concoction of white wine, butter, and garlic; a dish of the most tender baked clams; and perfectly al dente pasta crowned with juicy shrimp.

A special mention is due for the irresistible focaccia bread – three baskets of warm, pillowy goodness that acted as the perfect sponge for the delightful sauces accompanying our meal. Indeed, the bread was not just an accompaniment but an essential component of our feast.

Service was attentive and accommodating, pleasantly agreeing to split our check, which was the cherry on top of a delightful dining experience. In all, this restaurant is a beacon of comfort food and hospitality, suitable for anyone looking to escape the humdrum of a rainy day.",1
19751,"I haven't eaten at Pelicana for a while, so I forgot what it tasted like. They definitely did not disappoint. I ate with three other friends and we ordered a full size of boneless chicken and we chose their Pelicana sauce as well as Honey Garlic. When our order arrived, it was huge! Even the chicken pieces were huge! For comparison, one of Pelicana's pieces is like twice the size of other Korean fried chicken. Both sauces tasted really good and flavorful, but if I were to choose one, I would go for their signature Pelicana sauce. I don't know what about it, but it just tasted really good and you get to adjust the spice level too. The mild is not spicy at all, so if you are one to love spicy food, I would suggest getting a higher level of spice. The chicken meat was tender and juicy, which is perfect because no one wants to eat dry chicken meat. If you want some good Korean fried chicken, Pelicana is definitely a good option.",0
1179,"I was really excited to try Ichrian since New York is their first city in the US to open up.  I came with a group of four people on Sunday evening around 7 and the wait was around 45 minutes.  While in line, we were given the order sheets so we can customize our ramen order.  They only have one type of broth which is their classic tonkotsu and their ramen starts at $18.90.  They also have a veggie option available if you don't eat pork.  The toppings that are included are chashu slices, scallions, garlic, and their spicy sauce.  On the order sheet, you can customize how much scallion, garlic, spicy sauce you want and even the richness of the broth and the firmness of your noodles.  You can also add on extra toppings, such as extra chashu, scallions, soft boiled egg, dried seaweed, and mushroom.  They had an option where you can add all five extra items for $5 more, which turns out to be a better deal than adding them separately.The concept of this place is individual seats in your own booth and they will take your order and bring out your food through a serving station in front of you that is closed off with a curtain for privacy.  The experience requires you to sit and eat by yourself which results in minimal talking to one another.  Once seated, they take your completed order form and start making your food.  I ordered the tonkotsu ramen and added the recommended toppings set for $5 extra.  I also like my soup spicy so I did a level 6 spice.  The food came out pretty quick and I was able to enjoy my ramen in no time.  The broth itself was rich and flavorful and the spice gave it a nice kick but wasn't too overpowering.  Noodles are thin and were also good but I personally prefer thicker ramen noodles.   Chashu was a little on the thin side and I wish there was some sort of char to it.Overall, I enjoyed the meal and experience but for around $25 for a bowl of ramen, I felt it was a bit steep.  There are definitely more reasonably priced ramen joints that are fairly equivalent in taste.",0
16424,"Title: Hudson Yards Dining Delight

Our dining experience at Hudson Yards was a complete hit! We indulged in a delicious lunch complemented by the stunning Hudson River views. Starting with the hamachi crudo, it was undeniably fresh, though somewhat underwhelming in flavor. My companion savored a flavorful mushroom risotto enriched with a miso butter sauce, while I thoroughly enjoyed a well-prepared, tender grilled octopus. The service was commendable as well, thanks to our extremely courteous waitress. A wonderful meal overall!",1
2267,"We went for lunch and don't have to wait. We were seated right away. The staff was very friendly and the ambiance was nice. I got the akamaru modern which was very tasty. The waiter said they accidentally put an egg in but didn't charge me, which was good because I didn't order it. But I would next time because it was very good. I was debating on getting the karaka spicy but glad I didn't because it was a little too spicy for me. However, my boyfriend got it and loved it. I just wish they had gyoza as an appetizer available. I think all around it was a great lunch though and glad we went.",0
12942,"Our niece made a reservation for us to meet at this restaurant to remember her Mom and Dad, who used to dine here quite often. It was a lovely and quaint restaurant.  We were warmly greeted and seated at a quiet table in the corner, which was perfect for us.  We were expertly taken care of by petite Danielle (there are 2 Danielle's that work for the restaurant).  This is a family owned business, and it shows.  We started with two Salade d'Endives au Bleu D'Auvergne et Noix (Endive Salad with Blue Cheese & Walnuts) and two special-of-the-evening salads of arugula, butternut squash, and cranberries in a mango vinaigrette.  We were off to a great start.  The salads were fresh and full of flavor.  Two of us enjoyed the house special for the evening of a classic Coq Au Vin.  My husband enjoyed the Fusili a la Sauce Bolognaise and our niece had the Filet of Sole Meunière.  Our dinners were just perfect in every way.  For a sweet ending, we shared a Crème Caramel and a Mousse au Chocolat. Thank you for a lovely dinner.",0

1021,"We have been experimenting with Korean fried chicken lately, so we had to stop by. We got the Pelicana spicy chicken wings, with a side of fries. I thought fries were kinda pricey at $7, but was pleasantly surprised with how many we got with our order - plus they were super crunchy, delicious and hot when we got them, so it was well worth the price. The wings were okay as well, I can't say they were the greatest, but they were alright. They took quite a while to come out, so be aware of that. I probably will never come back here, but it was good to try it at least once! The location inside of the Korean food hall was neat and fun to visit.",0
3236,"I was kind of afraid that this place would be just another solid, not outstanding, overpriced token ethnic cuisine spot in New York. You know what I mean - there are so many, and most aren't really worth checking out.I was very pleasantly surprised by Mari Vanna. Firstly, the interior was GORGEOUS. Photos don't do it justice. It's beautiful, slightly kitschy and twee, and feels like it might have come out of the manor of a lesser noble in St. Petersburg (I've been). The decor is a refreshing change from the standard ultra modern/trendy ambiance of most NYC establishments, and is worth the trip alone.Luckily, the food is delicious as well! Dinner is probably pricier, but at lunch they serve a $25 prix fixe that includes a hefty appetizer and entree which is a great deal. We ordered the salmon salad, herring (yum if you like raw fish), chicken stroganoff, and beef pelmeni. Portions and quality were good and quite tasty. I confess that I am generally a huge fan of Eastern European food - meat, smoked fish and potatoes, what's not to like? For lunch, I also enjoyed the food and ambiance much more than Veselka (more of a diner) and find both establishments to be similarly priced, in which case Mari Vanna is the clear winner.I read some reviews stating that service was bad, but during lunch the servers were very friendly and responsive.Worth the trip!",0
13491,"Where has Omar's Mediterranean Cuisine been all my life? Apparently on 39th and Madison. Mediterranean is one of my top cuisines and I was very impressed with everything I tried. I ordered their Special veggie combo which included falafel, tabouli, hummus, baba ganoush, and pita bread. Their pita bread is soft and tasty and it goes great with all the sauces they include like a spicy orange sauce, garlic mayo, and tahini sauce. They give you a small piece of baklava with your order, it was rich and satisfying which leads me to believe that it's probably the size I should be eating instead of the huge slices I usually have. The service was great and fast, the restaurant was empty when I walked in which I hear is a rare thing. I was quickly attended to and I walked out with my delicious meal five minutes later. The restaurant is cute but old-school and definitely looks like it has some history to it. I will be a regular at Omar's Mediterranean Cuisine going forward.",0
10371,"This place has a great vibe... I just had a bunch of drinks over a business meeting and I try their dessert cake. It was really good, nice and rich. Other than that, the staff was pleasantly inviting and the manager that day was cool also. I will probably come back here to try a dish with date because it definitely has that vibe outside of talking smack and closing deals. Live, Laugh & Love",0
1591,"Recently, I returned to Raclette for a delightful second visit—my first being back in 2016. This time around, I was well-prepared. Unlike my initial experience where my partner and I ambitiously each ordered our own raclette, I learned that one raclette is more than sufficient for 2-3 people to share. On this occasion, I dined with two others, and we opted for the Suisse Prosciutto Raclette alongside two tartines: the Fig and the Tuna. This proved to be an ideal combo for our party of three.

The Raclette itself was as mouth-watering as I remembered, striking a perfect balance of salty goodness, beautifully complemented by the theatrical scrape of molten cheese at our table—a sight and experience not to be missed, though I’d suggest indulging promptly before the cheese solidifies. Among the tartines, the Fig was the standout for me, confirming the popular preference.

Raclette remains one of my go-to spots in NYC for its unique and savory offerings that bring people together around comfort food at its finest.",1
12473,"Another outstanding restaurant by Danny Meyer! The views are incredible, whether it's day or night! And food was on point! Every recommendation made by our waiter was fantastic & he even presented a mini birthday cake for my friend because I told him it was her birthday! Loved every moment dining here. Food was fab - I had the snails, the duck degustation & the date cake (and I loved the spreads with the French baguette!). None of the dishes disappointed! And please do yourself a favor and check out the fantastic decor, the open kitchen, the gorgeous bathroom & the lounge room (the Bay Room). Manhatta sure does not disappoint!",0
2556,"I recently visited a restaurant where I had the pleasure of trying their Lobster Burger, and it was nothing short of fantastic. The idea of surf and turf on a burger is pure genius. The lobster, drenched in a garlic seasoning, paired perfectly with the succulence of the beef burger. For an added touch of delight, I suggest asking for avocado to top it off — it really brings an extra dimension to this already flavorful dish. Highly recommended!",1

I indulged in the adobada tacos, and I can say without a trace of exaggeration, they're the finest I've ever savored. Authenticity oozes from this gem of a spot, mimicking a genuine Mexican street taco stand to perfection. They offer homemade tortillas, both corn and flour, that will transport your taste buds straight to taco heaven. The menu is delightfully simple, with just three toppings and four taco varieties, but it's a masterclass in the art of ""less is more."" Eating here isn't just a meal; it's a transcendent experience. Do yourself a favor and give this place a visit—you won't regret it.",1

During my week-long visit to New York City, I stumbled upon this gem of a restaurant for breakfast and it absolutely blew my mind.

3550,"Title: Adequate Katsu Experience with Sluggish Service

My visit to the katsu restaurant was a mixed bag. The service left something to be desired, as our food arrived notably slower than expected. However, the staff did acknowledge the delay with a small discount, which was a considerate gesture.

The meal started on an interactive note by allowing patrons to grind their sesame seeds for the dipping sauce. A highlight was the Berkshire Pork Katsu set, accompanied by a special soup. While the katsu was competently prepared, it failed to stand out from other similar establishments. The set included a generous serving of cabbage and the perk of unlimited refills, although the cabbage largely served as a mere accompaniment for the dressing.

In summary, the service hiccups and unremarkable food make it hard to recommend the restaurant when craving exceptional katsu, though the experience might suffice for those seeking a basic katsu meal with modest expectations.",1
15293,"Title: Underwhelmed by Trattoria Dell'Arte

I stumbled upon Trattoria Dell'Arte during a bustling Friday afternoon, lured in by its convenient location across from Carnegie Hall. Unfortunately, the experience didn't match the promising setting. Despite the commendable attentiveness of the staff, the food left much to be desired. 

I opted for the $32 Prix-fixe lunch, which proved disappointing in both value and flavor. In a baffling turn of service, my starter of braised octopus and calamari – which was just passable – arrived alongside my main course. This forced me to switch between dishes to avoid my meal cooling. The Seafood Papardelle lacked depth and zest, and I found myself so disenchanted that I forewent the included dessert.

It's clear that their foot traffic may be bolstered by tourists, but for the prices charged – entreés soaring between $20-$30 – I anticipated far more. Despite their 4-star Yelp rating, this visit showed that culinary excellence wasn't on the menu. Would I recommend Trattoria Dell'Arte? If your priority is food quality commensurate with the cost, perhaps keep moving.",1
10902,"Title: Magical Eats Right Next to Harry Potter's Stage

Review:

I found a little slice of heaven at a bustling eatery located conveniently across the street from the Lyric Theatre. It was a lifesaver during a Harry Potter double-feature day! The food was nothing short of amazing - the carne asada nearly made me forget I wasn't in California. 

What's magic here is the dual ability to dine in swiftly or grab takeout. After traveling all the way from Hawaii and bracing for a marathon of The Boy Who Lived, my weary body craved a good stretch and some hearty food. Their takeout was the perfect call; I savored their mouth-watering tacos and the sweet comfort of horchata back in my room, revitalizing me for the shows.

For any Potterhead who doesn't want to miss a beat or a bite, this spot is a must-visit. Quick service, delicious eats, and the perfect location to refuel between curtain calls.",1
16425,"Yes, the food here is delicious. However, nothing is particularly outstanding. I truly think this place is extremely overpriced. I love fine dining and I don't mind paying more for a great meal. However, this was not worth the value. My sea bass was delicious and I had two glasses of white wine with no sides. Four of us shared two appetizers and some fries and the bill was over $500. Definitely not worth the hype. Great ambiance though. My group definitely felt rushed to leave our table.",0

18354,"Its been a stressful month, not going to lie; studying and not eating well. I was so excited that I got to try Tang Hotpot because I'm a hotpot aficionado and I like chefin' it up!  My boyfriend and I arrived at 5:30pm and were seated promptly, the table setting is very classy and I liked that they used cloth napkins! We ordered the mother/son pot (this is so cute!!) which had the spicy beef broth at the bottom and a smaller pot of simmered pork bone broth at the top. We opted for all the dipping sauces but were especially fascinated by the ""truffle oil w/ butter sauteed mushroom flakes/sesame paste"". I wish all hotpot restaurants offered this sauce because it was DELICIOUS. The meats/veggies were ordered were part of the Tang Deluxe Platter. Additionally, we decided to try the eye of round, and the USDA Certified Prime Rib Eye. One thing you should know is that everything here is thoughtfully and meticulously prepared. The plating is simplistic but quality is through the roof. My favorites were definitely the Miyazaki Kobe Rib Eye, lotus root, fish ball (cuttle) and the sliced eye of round. I prefer my beef fatty so sliced eye of round and miyazaki kobe rib eye is perfect. No hotpot is complete without some drinks, we got the fresh coconut and the watermelon juice. I think they definitely added something special to the coconut juice because it GAVE ME LIFE, it was perfectly sweet and ice cold so I ordered two. My boyfriend liked his watermelon juice, and you can tell there is no added sugar because it wasn't overly sweet. Overall, I am definitely going to return because quality over quantity, and the prices are worth what you get in return. And, thank you Kevin for being so attentive and always checking up on me!",0

20407,"Title: A Vietnamese Gem in Chinatown – Thai Son

If you're on the hunt for authentic Vietnamese cuisine at wallet-friendly prices, Thai Son in Chinatown is a must-visit. My recent Sunday visit at 5 pm revealed a bustling hotspot that, despite the crowd, had no trouble seating us immediately.

We indulged in perennial favorites: the grilled pork chop over rice, an all-beef toppings pho, and vermicelli noodles accompanied by grilled pork and crispy spring rolls – each dish delivering a flavor-packed punch. The pork chops are a standout and a non-negotiable order. To top it off, their smoothies offer a refreshing counterbalance to the savory delights.

The value here is hard to beat, with generous portions priced between $8-13. Service is efficient, ensuring a swift transition from order to table. Thai Son is the place to satisfy your Vietnamese food cravings without breaking the bank. Highly recommended for a budget-friendly feast!",1
20442,"Title: Surprisingly Satisfactory Delivery Experience

I recently opted for delivery from this spot on a night when cooking was off the table and my hunger couldn't settle on a specific craving. To my pleasant surprise, the experience defied my apprehension given some of the less-than-stellar reviews online. Priced reasonably, the food didn't take a toll on my wallet, and the speedy, courteous delivery service further enhanced my positive impression.

The standout dish, a colossal Greek Salad, was fresh and flavorful, though initially arrived without its dressing counterpart. A quick phone call rectified the issue, with the missing component arriving in mere minutes—a testament to their commitment to customer satisfaction.

While others may have had varying experiences, mine was a testament to giving restaurants a fair chance to impress. Based on this encounter, I'm inclined to order again, chalking up any negative feedback to the occasional off day that can happen in any business. They've earned a repeat customer in me.",1
12406,"Decided to come here to try some delicious northwestern Chinese cuisine. The plates here are shareable so i recommend to share with a friend because they are pretty big. Plus it is so much better to share than not! Appetizer: steamed beef shumai (6 piece) Entree: Sautéed rice noodle with beef and traditional sauce. This plate also, had a couple of vegetable in the mix and had a spicy kick to it in which i loved because it was the perfect type of spicy- not super spicy at all. Tip: I recommend to get on the waiting list on yelp before heading there because the restaurant gets packed super fast and when i went there were like 5 parties ahead of me. If you get on the waitlist before leaving by the time you get to the restaurant i am sure you will be seated right away.",0

A video of this exploded on Facebook recently so I had to try it. Everything from the tables, to the servers, to the water glasses etc remind you of a Paris restaurant. Their traditional cheese reminds me of a very potent swiss cheese. It was delicious and the experience was so cool. We got the New York for two which gives you steak, potatoes and mushrooms for atleast two people. Everything on the plate was delicious and I would highly recommend this beautiful place",0
17718,"Title: Late Nights and Delicious Bites at 4 Charles

My dining experience at 4 Charles Prime Rib was nothing short of spectacular, and it began unconventionally with a late reservation at 11:45 PM. Leaving a board game night for this outing initially felt like a sacrifice, but any hint of regret dissipated the moment I stepped into the restaurant's inviting ambiance.

With an attentive wait staff guiding us through the menu, my friend and I indulged in the Chicago Cut - a steak that was as delicious as it was meticulously prepared. Accompanying our main course was a Corn Elote side dish that complemented the steak beautifully. We capped off the meal with a robust coffee and a heavenly dessert.

My second visit was with a group at a more conventional 5:15 PM slot. We opted for the same stellar lineup, adding a burger to the mix for a shared taste. Consistency is key, and 4 Charles nailed it yet again with their sublime dishes.

Both visits left me at a loss for words; the experiences are best conveyed through the vivid pictures I took, which speak volumes more than I ever could. If you're planning a visit, my advice is simple: don't miss out on the prime rib, and treat yourself to the chocolate mousse cake paired with a glass of wine. It's worth every moment of your time.",1
17043,"Title: Delicious Cuisine Marred by Sluggish Service

My colleagues and I recently dined at this restaurant for a work lunch, and we were all impressed with both the presentation and flavor of our meals. Every dish we ordered turned out to be a delightful culinary experience worthy of praise. However, I must deduct a star due to the lackluster service we received. The service was noticeably slow, and our server lacked attentiveness, detracting from an otherwise enjoyable dining experience.",1
14805,"Title: A Satisfying Slice at the New Upper East Side Spot

I recently visited the newest location of a favorite pizza chain, expanding from their Lower East Side roots to the Upper East Side. The welcoming staff and ample seating made for a comfortable visit. Opting for a classic, I enjoyed a pepperoni slice and a garlic knot for an affordable $5.

They quickly warmed up my slice, serving it perfectly toasty. The standout pepperoni cups expertly cradled the pizza grease with a delightful charred flavor, complementing the tangy tomato sauce. While the garlic knot was just average, the pizza slice itself was robust and satisfying.

This first experience at the Upper East Side location confirms that it's a go-to spot for a reliable pizza fix in the neighborhood.",1
12105,"Title: A Game-Changing Slice at Manero's

If the essence of Bensonhurst could be captured in a pizza, Manero's would be the masterpiece. Amidst a sea of classic red sauce Italian eateries, this slice joint, opened by a true Bensonhurst native, stands out with its homage to the iconic Tony Manero of ""Saturday Night Fever.""

The secret to Manero's exceptional slices begins with their crust – a golden treasure made with double zero flour that's both delicately crispy and satisfyingly chewy. Each slice boasts a perfectly balanced, juicy tomato sauce crafted from the finest California tomatoes, hitting all the right notes of tang and sweetness.

From the first bite, it's clear you're not just tasting pizza; you're experiencing a slice of local culture served with a side of Brooklyn pride. And in a modern twist, don't forget your plastic – Manero's moves at the speed of the city, accepting charge cards only.

For anyone craving a pizza that truly dances to the borough's beat, Manero's is a must-visit. Just be prepared to leave saying, ""Holy pizza crust!"" because this joint is serving up slices that'll make you feel like you're strutting down 86th Street with Tony Manero himself.",1
13440,"Title: Hidden Italian Delight in the Heart of the City

I recently stumbled upon an unassuming Italian restaurant with my friends and it turned out to be quite the find! Anticipation was high with an initial wait time of 20-30 minutes, but to our delight, the accommodating host swiftly whisked us to a cozy table.

We kicked off our experience with a $55 bottle of wine, a treat for our trio of oenophiles. It was presented with care and didn't last long at our table. The burrata special was a creamy dream paired with the salty prosciutto and sweet peaches - a triumphant trio of flavors. The calamari and zucchini were a highlight as well, with perfect crispiness that set the bar high.

For main courses, the penne vodka truly shone, boasting al dente pasta bathed in a sauce that captured the essence of Italian cuisine. The sausage pizza, however, was less remarkable, tasting fairly standard and leaving us curious about their other offerings.

Despite the minor pizza letdown, the overall experience was a positive one. With friendly staff, fair prices, and generally excellent food, this little gem merits a return visit. Four stars!",1
14425,"I originally wanted to check this place out in Osaka, but the lines were always insane. I'm glad I was able to have an experience here at NYC instead. I went by myself and was seated immediately around 11:30am. The dining experience is really unique which is definitely the selling point of Ichiran. The only face to face interaction you get is when the waitress seats you and when you pay at the end up front. You never see the faces of the people taking your order or handing you your food. The ramen itself was delicious! Not the best I've ever had, but it was solid. I ordered the tonkotsu ramen without any add ons. I got the firm noodles (which I always recommend in a hot broth) and a level 4 spicy. I also got the recommended salt and oil levels. I think next time, I would order light salt and oil though. Upon arrival, they also gave me a complimentary extra noodle refill card, so I ended up using it. I was so stuffed! Overall, the ramen is definitely pricey. With tax, it'll come to around $20. For that day, it was worth it since I got the free noodle refill but otherwise, this meal would've been pricey for what it was.",0
11002,"Title: A Chelsea Market Find – Creamline Delights!

After a near-miss with closing eateries and an overpriced tuna melt elsewhere in Chelsea Market, my serendipitous encounter with Creamline around 9pm was a stroke of good fortune. Not only were their prices more palatable – $12 for a tuna melt versus $15 down the hall – but the quality and service were standout.

Despite the bustling environment, the staff at Creamline were a model of courteousness and attentiveness. The joy of discovering beer on tap, particularly a few choices from Blue Point, added to the satisfaction of the visit.

Soon enough, a zesty and perfectly crunchy tuna melt arrived, with the bread earning top marks in my book. It’s not often that a fast-casual spot checks in on diners at their tables, yet here was Creamline, ensuring our dining experience was up to par.

In a nutshell, Creamline is a must-try for anyone navigating through Chelsea Market. Whether it’s for a sandwich, burger, or shake, expect quality food, reasonable prices, and service that goes the extra mile.",1
1148,"Title: Disappointing Visit to Local Thai Restaurant

As a new neighbor, I ventured into a nearby Thai restaurant with high hopes, only to leave with the certainty that I won't return. The appealing front decor belied an unfinished interior where we were seated. A promised two-minute wait for our table turned into an eight-minute standstill beside an uncleaned space.

Once seated, the inattentive service continued. Our server, visibly short-staffed, lacked warmth and communication skills, disappearing without confirmation after taking requests. We received our meals promptly within five minutes, yet had to wait for utensils to actually eat.

The food's flavor did not compensate for the lackluster quality—$15 for lackluster noodles and a surcharge for any protein beyond the standard was steep. The final straw was being handed to-go boxes to pack our leftovers ourselves, an odd practice for a restaurant with dishes priced at $36, autotip included.

In summary, the restaurant's interior, service, and value were disappointing. For a better-executed plate of Pad Thai or Pad See Ew and a more pleasant dining experience, I'll gladly look elsewhere.",1
12116,"I recently dined at this local gem where the pizza truly stands out. The crust strikes the perfect balance between thin and thick without any hint of chewiness, instead offering a delightful melt-in-your-mouth experience. Complemented by a scrumptious sauce, each slice is an absolute delight.

In addition to the pizza, the chocolate chip cookies deserve a special mention. Far from your average cookie, it's more akin to a generous chunk of chocolate goodness. The cookie arrived soft, warm, and gooey—a decadent treat that sent me straight to dessert heaven.

Don't just take my word for it; I highly recommend grabbing a slice (or two) for yourself. Indulge in a little slice of heaven and you'll surely be echoing my thanks later!",1
1173,"Their warm, pillowy Persian bread would be worth a visit in itself, though everything is delicious and fresh.  Your skewer of choice is grilled to order.  Team behind the counter is friendly in talking you through all available options.  I was more amused than I should have been by their machine that dispenses water and ice all at once.  And they get so many brownie points for their soundtrack that's a mix of Disney and Christmas carols.  I heard Aladdin, Tarzan, and Lion King while there - with some ""Up on the Housetop"" thrown in.  All the childhood feels.",0
19460,"I came here with friends for dinner and it looked so cute and so intimate that it seemed like it would be a perfect little spot. We started off with the happy hour classic margaritas which were $8 and full of disappointment. I love margaritas and am in no way snobby about them, never once turned one away until I tried theirs. It literally tasted like just straight up lime juice so I did ask them to remake it. The second one was better but still not particularly good. I'm glad I paid their happy hour price for it at least. We started off with a large guacamole which was a very generous portion for three people and they were quick to replace our chips as needed.For dinner I just got a quesadilla with steak and that was very good and the perfect amount of food. Perhaps a little pricy at $18 but still tasted good.I probably wouldn't come back- it's possible the margaritas were just a total fluke but it did sour the experience.",0
12339,"On a quick visit to New York this restaurant was near my location. Yes a quick Yelp search! Additionally I was able to make a reservation and earn points using another app. So this was a no brained. I'm glad I came because I found a good balance of service, ambiance and food. Although the decor namely the white ceramic tile floor could use an update. But it's a very nice open space starting with a large bright bar at the entrance. As far as service the host immediately greeted and seated me for my reservation. My server appeared shortly after. I was given the necessary timed attention before my meal not so much during. There was too much of a lull while eating but I really didn't need anything so it was cool for me not so sure it would be ok for others. I had breakfast, two eggs any style option. My scrambled eggs came with a meat choice it was bacon for me with fried potatoes (onions and peppers automatically added, yummy) and toast. Everything was cooked as requested and arrived very timely. The potatoes were room temperature probably because they're precooked. I really prefer hot food but I adjusted.For the price, service amount of food and service I would return.",0
14605,"This Mediterranean eatery offers a satisfyingly ""clean"" and tasty menu, standing out when compared to its peers. The falafels hit the mark with flavor, and the generous serving of hummus didn't disappoint. Their brown rice—a staple for many—is also commendable. However, the $12 price tag feels steep, particularly if you're eyeing extras, making this spot more suited for the occasional lunch splurge rather than a daily go-to.",1
2291,"Returning to this gem for dinner, I'm reminded why it's a favored spot. The fresh Mediterranean fare consistently impresses, and the service remains impeccable. With the arrival of warmer months, their delightful outdoor seating becomes a highlight, though the cozy, dimly lit interior still beckons for those cooler evenings. The small bar is a standout, offering a selection of outstanding drinks, complemented by attentive service from both the wait staff and bartender. Highly recommend for a reliably excellent dining experience.",1
16321,"Title: A Stellar First Dinner at The Ragtrader

Our inaugural dinner in NYC at The Ragtrader was an absolute delight, meriting a solid five-star rating for both service and cuisine. The tomato bisque soup warmed us up with its creamy richness, setting a high bar for the meal. The fried chicken sliders were a standout, with the red cabbage slaw and sriracha aioli creating a symphony of flavors in our mouths. Although the seared scallops were succulent, the serving size was a tad disappointing with just two pieces. However, we rounded off our meal with the dark chocolate ganache dessert—a bold and exquisite choice, with its intense chocolatey taste paired with coconut crème and a sprinkle of macadamia nuts. Don't miss out on this delectable finale to a truly remarkable dining experience.",1
18541,"Title: Cozy Holiday Charm with Mixed Culinary Impressions

I recently visited a quaint restaurant renowned for its delightful Christmas decor, which certainly didn't disappoint. The tiny venue was a winter wonderland, tastefully adorned without feeling overcrowded—a true holiday gem that required a reservation to enjoy its serene atmosphere. 

The festive spirit extended to their special drink menu, with the ""Under the Mistletoe"" cocktail standing out as a seasonal favorite. It was a hit at our table and added to the overall merry ambience.

When it came to the food, my Steak and Eggs Benedict didn't quite hit the mark. The steak was on the chewier side, and the eggs a bit too runny for my taste. My companions sampled the French Toast and Turkey Club, finding them passable but not outstanding, and all of us were left wanting a bit more substance to our meals.

In summary, if you're seeking a spot with an endearing holiday vibe and satisfactory Christmas concoctions, this could be your niche. However, if it's culinary excellence you're after, you might want to consider other options—or perhaps just stick to the drinks and the decorations.",1
12598,"Not a good experience.Came here to escape the San Gennaro Feast mayhem, and grab some drinks and food.  There was a wait in the dining area so we opted for the bar.  No one came over AT ALL!  Had to go up to the bar to grab drinks.  When it came time to order food, I asked the bartender to help us since he was helping the table next to us, and he COMPLETELY blew me off.  Seeing that he pretty much said ""FU"", I had enough at this point.  I went to the dining area to ask for a table.  The manager was helpful, but did NOT do anything to compensate for the horrible service (IE: buy a round of drinks, or an appetizer for the table).  Also, he stated that he did not have enough staff for the night.  Come on, it is Saturday night and you've been in business for many years.  Being understaffed is not a customer's PROBLEM!  So when your staff ignores our table, there is NO excuse for that.When the bread came out, it was your generic hero bread that was heated up, with a side of packaged butter.  That's the first sign of a bad Italian restaurant.  I decided to just order entrees, and get some food in us so we can leave.  I must say the Chicken Francese, and side pasta with meat sauce were very good.  I was able to cut into the chicken with my fork, no need for a knife which is how it should be.  The meat sauce was savory.  I wish I had more of it.SIDE NOTE:They have a parking lot for patrons, but you have to pay to park.  I know it is tough to find parking in NYC, but if you are a restaurant looking to attract customers then making them pay before they even walk into your establishment is a BIG slap in the face.  Get your act together!",0
13419,"Trufa easily tops my list of neighborhood favorites, especially for lunchtime visits. Their burgers offer standout quality, but the menu's depth goes beyond just that. Due to the cozy size of their dining area—prone to quick fills—I often opt for carry out. Nonetheless, it's a charming spot to dine in if you can snag a seat. Definitely worth checking out.",1

15320,"Came here on a Sunday for lunch, it was pretty empty, only one other other table was dining. The menu is very standard Cajun food, some appetizers, fried seafood baskets, wings etc. Ordered the mighty catch combo switched out the crawfish because I don't think it's the season so didn't want to risk. The combo comes with 1lb of snow crab, 1lb of headless shrimp 1lb of crawfish and 1lb of clam. The crab is juice and sweat, shrimp is very fresh and jumbo, clam size is very big. The corn taste prefect in the mighty sauce, I chose the spicy option it actually came really good kick. Recommend to add the sausage, taste really good in the sauce: For appetizer also ordered oyster basket with Cajun fries and hush poppies. They are both really tasty. The place is very bright with high ceiling. Service is fast and attentive.",0
16021,"I stopped by just to indulge in the Dole Whip soft serve, a rarity I haven't seen elsewhere. The value was excellent for the quantity served. With a sorbet-like texture, the soft serve definitely hit the spot. As someone who loves variety, I appreciated the twist option, combining pineapple with mango – a delightful surprise, given their rotating seasonal flavors.

However, while the server helpfully identified each flavor, the pineapple dominated, making it hard to distinguish the mango. The experience wasn't mind-blowing, but the tartness was enjoyable and proved to be a wonderfully refreshing way to cap off a meal on a sweltering summer day.",1
2867,"Discovering this hidden gem near the 86th St train station was a delight, especially with its early 8am Sunday opening – a rarity for breakfast aficionados. The establishment thoughtfully splits into a café side and table service, which, at my 9am arrival, seated me immediately despite a bustling atmosphere.

The menu boasts an impressive breakfast selection, including a 'Power Breakfast' – an excellent value featuring a trio of eggs, a choice of succulent bacon or sausage, a fresh salad, customizable bread, perfectly seasoned potatoes, a juice option, and a hot drink. The well-proportioned meal hit the spot without crossing into excess.

Though the black coffee's lightness wasn't quite to my taste, the French toast was an absolute triumph. Despite missing the chance to try the caramel banana walnut, the mascarpone mixed berry did not disappoint, perfectly complementing the neutral toast.

The cherry on top was the friendly host, who charmingly rewarded my food photography efforts with cookies. By my departure at 10:10am, a queue had formed, a testament to the locale's appeal. I wholeheartedly recommend this spot and eagerly anticipate my next visit, with the French toast high on my list.",1
20212,"Walked in on a weeknight around 6:30 PM and got stool seats against the wall, bit of a squeeze but not too bad. My boyfriend and I shared the deep fried eggplant, Niku udon, fried chicken and gyoza. Only thing I wasn't crazy about was the gyoza. Overall a solid spot with tasty fare.",0
12286,"Tucked away in the Lower East Side, this gem of a ramen shop offers excellent, fast service alongside a clean and cozy dining experience. Though seating is limited, the space is well-maintained, and the ramen selection is top-notch with delicious, hearty options that cater to vegans as well. The New Tokyo Style Shoyu Ramen is particularly noteworthy for its robust flavor and noodles cooked to perfection. A must-visit for any ramen enthusiast.",1
19149,"Love this place! This was our second time dining here and it was amazing as always! We came in for a nice warm French meal on this cold Black Friday and it was the best. The escargot and seafood crepes are so delicious, I could probably just eat their bechamel sauce with a spoon. Very cozy and cute inside. Their prix fixe is very well priced and offers large portions. Can't wait to return!!",0
16239,"I recently dined at a bustling eatery where the ambiance was loud and energetic, with pop/EDM tunes setting a lively background. The service was commendable for its speed and efficiency.

The Sticky Ribs earned themselves a solid 4 stars, thanks to a hint of sweetness and their fall-off-the-bone tenderness. The Duck Salad was a standout with a full 5-star rating; the Caesar dressing was a perfect complement to the fresh veggies and succulent duck.

However, the Specialty Peking Duck Ramen didn't quite hit the mark, receiving 3 stars. While the broth was reminiscent of comforting wonton soup and the noodles were fresh and perfectly al dente, it fell short of being the best ramen I've encountered in NYC.

Overall, it was a dining experience highlighted by delectable dishes in a vibrant setting, even if the ramen didn't quite live up to its peers in the city's competitive food scene.",1
17829,"Nestled within a versatile setting, the restaurant presents two distinct dining experiences: a relaxed vibe in the front bar area and an elevated scene with tablecloths at the back for those seeking fine dining. Interestingly, the menu remains consistent throughout, offering patrons the same exquisite choices no matter where they're seated.

One notable feature is their all-inclusive service policy—tips are courteously declined for both servers and coat check attendants, which does add a touch of simplicity the dining process. Be prepared, though, as the establishment does not fall under the 'cheap eats' category.

The culinary journey begins with a superbly executed smooth onion soup, enhanced with crunchy croutoons for texture contrast. The octopus and beef tartar, boasting a delightful Mexican twist, do not just meet expectations but exceed them with their freshness and bold flavors.

Main courses like the kale salad, a perfectly fried fish sandwich, and tantalizing tile fish maintain the quality, coming in satisfying portions without leaving diners feeling overly stuffed.

While the desserts didn't quite hit the mark—the cassis sorbet was a tad too tart and the black-pepper ice cream with quince slightly missed the sweet spot—the drink selection saved the day. The barley wine comes highly recommended, and the Grenache blanc was a hit with my companion.

In conclusion, this restaurant is definitely worth a revisit for an evening meal, promising a culinary adventure with upscale tastes and an emphasis on diner satisfaction.",1
20947,"It's weird: Even as I type, I keep vacillating between the decision to give this place four (4) or five (5) stars. The first time I visited I was just looking  for a nice spot that was open late to grab a drink with a friend from out of town. Their drinks and bar staff were AMAZING.  When you couple that with a really interesting, Victorian Era Inspired decor, you get the makings of a great night. The kitchen was closed by the time we got there so I had to make a note to come back and see if the food stacked up to the rest of the set up.  ""Therein lies the rub."" The menu was really big and wide ranging. We couldn't really discern a theme from it. There's nothing wrong with that. We ordered stuff like nachos and one of the chicken dishes but none of it 'wowed' us. It wasn't bad. It's just that we expected more especially given the level 'wow' derived from the drinks and ambiance. Bottom line: Go for the drinks and the decor but maybe grab a bite elsewhere first?",0
18451,"I stopped by for Happy Hour and would rate the experience close to 4.5 stars! The Hot Sake deal at $5 was an absolute steal. The Bang Bang Shrimp was decent, though it didn't quite hit the mark of greatness. What really stood out were the Seared Salmon and Crispy Rice; both dishes oozed complexity with their textures, layers, and flavors. I'm definitely eager to return and explore more of the menu!",1
19994,"Title: A Feast for the Eyes, Not the Palate

My experience at this restaurant was one of visual splendor, yet culinary disappointment. The venue has mastered the art of crafting desserts and drinks that are a photographer's dream, with vibrant sparkly lattes in gold and pink, and desserts that dazzle the senses - visually. On a Thursday afternoon, the space was packed with patrons more keen on capturing the perfect shot than savoring their treats, which speaks volumes about the establishment's appeal.

While the rose dessert and the picture-perfect bun delighted our cameras, the flavors failed to impress, blending into a monotonous sugary taste. Despite the crowd, there was no wait to be seated, which seems to be a testament to the place's efficiency or perhaps reflects the quick photo ops over lingering meals.

Service struggled to keep up, understandably, given the scant 2-3 staff members navigating a full house. It's clear the place isn't investing in decor or culinary finesse but has instead opted to cater to the Instagram crowd.

In conclusion, if your objective is to embellish your social media feed with stunning images of desserts, this is certainly your haven. Just don't arrive with expectations of a gourmet experience - the true substance here is in its photogenic appeal, not in the flavors on your fork.",1

1980,"Tucked in an ally in Tribeca, this much hyped burger commands as long as a 3-hour wait for dinner. Is it worth the wait? NO! I don't think it's the best burger in the country as many claim. I don't even think it's the best burger in NYC. I prefer 4 Charles but that's not to say that the burger at Au Cheval is bad. It's very good. Go during lunch as I did, there was no wait. The space is surprisingly large; there's tables, booths and a large bar. The service was outstanding. Note that the single cheese burger comes with 2 patties and I think the double comes with 3. The addition of the bacon and the egg makes eating this monstrosity incredibly messy but that's what you come here for. The foie gras egg toast and chicken wings were also pretty good.",0
18189,"Title: A Scenic Lunch Experience with Room for Improvement

During a recent visit for a late lunch, the swift seating process was a welcome start, complemented by the stunning rooftop views overlooking Bryant Park and the tastefully decorated ambiance of the restaurant. The menu offerings, including chips and dip, a quesadilla, and a cobb salad, were satisfactory but didn't stand out amidst the culinary competition in the city, especially given the similar price range.

The primary allure of this spot is its location and setting, which does justify a visit. However, the service lagged, with noticeable delays before we were attended to, inconsistent water refills, and a lack of proactive table check-ins. It was quieter than expected, which made the wait more puzzling. The staff members were friendly when present, showing that service quality wasn't an issue of attitude but of attention.

In summary, while the restaurant offers a pleasant atmosphere, the overall experience doesn't quite match the expense, bearing in mind that part of what you're paying for is the enjoyment of the park surroundings. It's a decent choice for those valuing scenery over gastronomy or service swiftness.",1
12645,"I visited this charming restaurant recently and was impressed by its spacious and inviting interior. The salmon sandwich I ordered was delightful with its flavors perfectly complementing each other. However, a minor hiccup occurred as the salmon tended to slide out due to the generous amount of sauce included. Alongside the sandwich, the accompanying salad was crisp and refreshing, rounding out a pleasant dining experience.",1
12073,I ordered delivery from grub hub. I ordered chicken pho. Not only was my ordered 30 minutes late but the broth was basically water. I added soy sauce and it still was lighter than a normal broth. No flavor at all. They also did not include hot sauce in the delivery. Do yourself a favor and do not order their pho. I am very disappointed.,0
241,"Upon visiting this restaurant, I was pleasantly surprised by the falafel trio platter. A generous serving, complete with three different types of falafel, equating to nine pieces in total, was more than enough to have leftovers for another meal. Served over a fresh lettuce and cabbage salad, the platter also included creamy hummus, warm pita bread, additional salad, pickled accompaniments, and two delectable dipping sauces. Each falafel was delectably crispy and bursting with flavor, making the meal an absolute delight, especially considering the price tag was under $15.

Aside from the main course, the restaurant also offers a variety of sweets such as halva and baklava, and an array of Turkish packaged products. The staff's friendliness added to the already positive experience. This establishment has certainly earned a return visit from me.",1
2294,"I just can not RAVE enough about this fabulous atmospheric spot! Upon walking through the doors you are immediately greeted by a friendly hostess. The entire place looks like a scene out of the Phantom of the Opera! Dramatically beautiful hanging chandeliers, candelabras dripping with wax and a perfectly warm cozy lit restaurant! We split two bottles of wine and started with the incredible French onion soup, one of the bruschetta and an appetizer meatballs. All were perfect and we licked our plates clean. Then my brother had the sausage pizza, my girlfriend had the special Beet and Ricotta Raviolis and I had the gnocchi! Everything was perfectly cooked and seasoned well but not over seasoned. The pizza was a delightful thin coal fired crust, the blend of beet and ricotta was sweet and savory in the ravioli and my gnocchi was delicious as well! Can't recommend this place enough!",0
15189,"I regret to report that my recent dining experience fell short of expectations. Despite the bustling crowd drawn in by the appealing ambiance and the commendable efforts of the attentive staff, the culinary offerings were underwhelming. The lamb dish, anticipated with eagerness, proved a major letdown, and the burger suffered from an unpalatable dryness. Accompanying fries were marred by stubbornly tough onion rings. A solitary highlight in an otherwise lackluster meal was the house hot sauce, which was notably flavorful. Unfortunately, this alone could not salvage a meal that, overall, did not justify the cost.",1
15462,"This place just opened up, so they're trying really hard to impress and build a loyal customer base.When we came in at 7:45pm on a Thursday without reservations, we were lucky to get a table that just opened up. The small seating area [fits no more than 15-20 people], remained busy throughout the night.Very casual restaurant. Bare, brick walls, minimalistic décor, no frills.The service was the best part of our experience. Just like everyone on Yelp mentioned, the staff are very friendly and accommodating. We specified to ensure that our dishes have zero spice, as we are white and can't handle that. However, our appetizer was spicy. The manager, who is out in the dining area, constantly checking in on customers to ensure a perfect experience, apologized profusely, and a new dish, without spices was brought out to us quickly. The prices are reasonable and portions are filling. For an appetizer we got lab gai $11 minced chicken with cilantro, red onions, and chili lime juice, on a lettuce leaf, which was tender and light. Perfect for anyone wanting a lighter meal for the night. Nothing extraordinarily crazy in terms of flavor, so don't expect to be mind blown.We got $15 beef pad med mamuang and $15 squid pad makua for mains. Both dishes are sauted, and served with a bowl of white rice, which we didn't touch. The beef and squid were in good proportion to the veggies. The sauces were not greasy, but on the lighter side. Pad Makua was our favorite, as it had a wider array of veggies and the purple egg plant was sauted to perfection.Appreciated how we were not rushed to leave right after finishing our meal. We took our time chatting and it felt nice to be welcome in a restaurant even after we paid the check.Overall, a simple, inexpensive, no-frills place with good service that is worth returning to.",0
21078,"Not all Chinatown cheap lunches are created equal. I'm not sure what the other yelpers were on but 4 stars for this place is not accurate. May Wah is known for their fried chicken or porkchop lunch special at $6. The restaurant is tiny, but they are quick and efficient. I ordered the chicken leg over rice with an added tea egg. It comes with pickled veggies and some sauce. The sauce was sooo salty. Maybe it was an off day? I'm not sure. The fried chicken was not dry though which was a plus. The egg was okay and a little overcooked as well as the rice. It was too mushy for my liking.I wasn't hungry after my meal, but I was definitely dying of thirst from the salt. This is one Chinatown lunch I can't recommend.",0
2498,"Great dessert place! It's relatively small so the wait can be quite long. Cookie camp was really good but I'll probably not order The Harvest again.

20875,"Came here with my friend last night for dinner since we were craving some Indian food and Drunken Munkey had such amazing reviews. When I got there, I was surprised at how small the place was. Wish we made reservations because even at 8PM, it was crowded af. The host told us there were no available tables until 9:30 but said he could seat us at the bar in about 15 minutes. We agreed to this but it took longer than expected, we were seated around 8:30. The host was super nice, apologized and gave us a round of drinks on him. We ordered the Pork Vindalu and Butter Chicken Tikka Masala. While we were waiting for the food, the host even gave us some free okra fries. Must've been our lucky day but his customer service definitely went above and beyond. What stands out about the Drunken Munkey is that the meat here is so tender. I loved both our entrees, although the Vindalu was a bit too spicy for me. We asked for the garlic naan for a $1 upcharge which was delicious! It had so much flavor. Easily my new favorite Indian restaurant and I would love to come back for their happy hour!",0
2694,"I really really loved this cute little restaurant. The space is very limited but they make the most of it by having several tables and really cute decor, which originally drew me in! The food was delicious, I got the pad Thai with chicken and it was very decently priced and came out in such a timely manner. The noodles were super moist and filled with a lot of flavor. Only negative is that I asked for mild spiciness, and it tasted way too hot, definitely more than mild. Other than that, the service was great and the portion size was super filling. Would recommend if you're coming here with one other person or two!",0

In the labyrinth of culinary delights that is NYC's Chinatown, discovering a restaurant that masters the art of traditional claypot rice is akin to striking gold. This unassuming spot boasts an impressive selection of 17 claypot rice combinations, each promising to flavor the rice beneath with a rich melange of ingredients. The quest for the crisped rice at the bottom of the claypot—reminiscent of childhood skirmishes for the prized crunchy bits—is a nostalgic journey worth every bite.

Among the claypot varieties, the Chicken, Preserved Meat, Salted Chicken, and Salted Fish & Minced Meat stand out, each dish enveloping the rice in a comforting embrace infused with homestyle flavors.

Not to be overshadowed, the rice rolls are a revelation here: fresh, delicate, and served piping hot, they might just be the best in Chinatown. With a smooth, silken skin enveloping fillings like Duck, Roast Pork, and Shrimp from the expansive selection, these rolls are a testament to skill and freshness.

Patience is a virtue as both specialties require time to prepare, a testament to their freshness and quality. The menu extends beyond these stars, but it's the claypot rice and rice rolls that shine the brightest, accompanied by excellent service and a notable mention of their exceptional iced coffee. This eatery is a must-visit for connoisseurs of traditional claypot fare and rice roll aficionados alike.",1
12903,"Title: A Saturday Night Delight at Kimchi Udon Kitchen

Our recent dining experience at Kimchi Udon Kitchen was a pleasant surprise, as we managed to avoid the usual wait times by arriving at 8:30 pm on a Saturday, swiftly getting seated as a party of two. The much-anticipated kimchi cream udon exceeded expectations with its harmonious blend of flavors where the kimchi added just the right zing without dominating the dish. For those with heartier appetites or looking to share, the omu soba (yakisoba) is not to be missed – its generous size offers ample deliciousness for a group. We also savored the Hamachi Tataki; elegantly served in a set of five pieces, it was as delightful in taste as it was in presentation. Overall, Kimchi Udon Kitchen delivered a satisfying meal in a welcoming environment.",1
3395,"I recently visited this restaurant and had quite a pleasant experience. The taco salad proved to be a pretty good choice, fresh and satisfying. While the sweet potato fries did lean on the oily side, their flavor made up for it. As for the desserts, the red velvet cupcake didn't quite hit the mark for me, coming off as rather bland, but the banana bread was a delightful save with its rich taste. The cherry on top was the friendly customer service that made the meal all the more enjoyable.",1
14670,"100% worth the type. So so good! I tried the chicken and the pork tacos and they were both amazing. The place seems to be always packed but since there are no seats, people don't stay here too long and the tables empty out pretty quickly. I also love the vibe of the place - good place to eat alone without feeling awkward! Most highly recommend.",0
19954,"Let's start off with service. Yes, I know I don't typically start off there, but in this instance it's a must. Richard was AMAZING. The consistency with which the staff kept up with our orders and their knowledge of what they had to offer was top-notch. The words that I said to my sister was: ""This is the best service I have ever had,"" and I stand by statement. Food: For our appetizers, we had a trio of the calamari, scallops with a tomato reduction and octopus. I fell in love with the scallops, and though the octopus and the calamari could have used a little more love in terms of seasoning, they were also very well prepared. We followed up with steak and Chilean Sea Bass for our entrees. That steak? I had to do a double take because I was surprised. This isn't a traditional steakhouse so it isn't known for its steak, but honestly it should be. Finally, we finished off with dessert: Tiramisu and some form of brownie-- the name currently escapes me, but it was personally recommended to me by Richard. I am really glad I complied because the chocolate was not at all overpowering. It was rich and delicious. Drinks: I had the Sauvignon Blanc and my sister has the Prosecco. Two beautiful wines. We finished off with Limoncello on the house. Delicious. Overall, a night to remember pre-show. I will be back. SPECIAL NOTE: I felt like FAMILY. Treated with such care and regard. Makes me want to be an Italian. We got hugs on the way out. It's rare to feel that welcome, and I thank the staff specifically for that. As always, happy eating and drinking. MarieMG.",0
19163,"I had an exceptional breakfast experience at this upscale eatery. Despite the hefty price tag, the quality justifies the cost. The eggs reached the table with impeccable cooking, and the French toast was simply divine, igniting a passionate culinary romance. Be mindful of their limited hours; breakfast ends at 11 am, though doors open at 7. Plan accordingly, as they enforce a cancellation fee for late changes. A visit here is worth setting the alarm for.",1
11315,"I had a good meal here but not great. The ambiance is chill and fun, but everything is very expensive for the quality that you receive. I'd go back. I got the fish and chips and my friend got the sirloin steak sandwich. The portion size was pretty good.",0
16475,"Title: A Delectable Staycation at Yip's

Yip's may be a local lunch go-to, but for an out-of-towner like me, it felt like an indulgent escape. Navigating the multi-story setup adds to the adventure – make a beeline for the buffet on the lower level; it's where the magic happens. The standout dishes have to be the spicy beef, bursting with flavors that tantalize the palate, the paradise chicken, a true taste of bliss, and the richly satisfying chicken curry. If these dishes are any indication of the rest of the menu, Yip's is undoubtedly a treasure trove of culinary delights. A true gem for both regulars and visitors seeking a sumptuous feast.",1
1867,"A Trini walks into a Dive Bar on the UWS and hears Soca/Calypso music playing the entire evening what do they do? If you answered fall in love with the spot DING DING DING DING DING! You're a winner! Well that's it. That's the end of my review. Ain't nothing left I can say except.....I like to talk so damn much you know I'm gonna say something else. SmDh. I asked a member of staff if they always play Soca seeing that this is the second time I'm experiencing this here. This Trini chick said, sometimes when they're at work they like to play it to feel at home. Can't beat that because I certainly felt at home!I like the play on the word Dive. I yelped for a dive bar in the area because I love 'em but this bar is actually a Dive Bar. Their theme is all about Diving, the ocean, not what we know as Dive bars. Got it? You don't, well pay them a visit. Soca. Soca. Soca! Wine wine wine! **Push back on it** **Roll dah bumper girl roll eet!**The End.",0
3479,"My partner and I stumbled upon a hidden gem where our $3 went a long way. We indulged in two enormous slices of pizza paired with a soda, a meal that left us more content than the extravagant $135 experience we had earlier. The array of topping combinations was impressive, ensuring a slice for every palate. The aroma of fresh pies greeted us at the door—a testament to the freshness and quality. It's safe to say, you simply can't go wrong with a visit here.",1
14387,"We ordered way too much food for 3 people. And you know, as much as I do love KBBQ, this meal was not on my radar this night. My team - boss, me and two co-workers - were dragging after a very long, meeting-intensive, events-laden week in New York. We had parted ways at the hotel earlier, planning on going our separate ways for the night. I went back up to my room, fell into a deep but brief coma, then woke up puckish and ready to shop. I checked my phone to make sure I hadn't missed any important or frantic calls or texts and saw a string of texts from my boss asking if I wanted KBBQ. To be fair, we'd been talking about going out for KBBQ all week, so it made sense. Still, my mind wanted a slice or two of NY pizza and an early night back at my hotel. Instead, I found myself waiting in the lobby for my boss and one co-worker (the other had smartly turned off her phone before turning int a pumpkin for the night) at 8:30 pm, waiting to travel together to Samwon and some KBBQ.I know this all makes it sound like I didn't enjoy the food, the evening or the company. I did, on all counts, but we were all spent, and not in our right minds. Had we been lucid, we definitely would not have ordered everything we did.We knew we wanted a variety of meats, of course. This restaurant didn't have a combo of meats for us to order, so we went with the pork belly, ribs and flank. We also ordered one of the egg souffles, dumplings and, because we were temporarily crazy, the bulgogi fries. Add to this the spread of ban chan and bottle of soju, and you might understand why we kind of hated ourselves at the end of our meal.The meat was rather tasty, but this is a KBBQ that doesn't let you do the Q (and in my head, the Q stands for cooking. Yes, I KNOW that's not right, but I'm doing a thing.) Once the meat is brought to your table, a restaurant employee stops by to make sure everything's cooked the way it's supposed to be, and to split the meal up into even portions.The food was good, but I think the thing we consumed the most of was the ban chan. I lost track of the number of times my boss asked the waitress to refill the kimchee, pickled vegetables and tofu.The souffle was fluffy and light, but the bulgogi fries were completely unnecessary. They were good in that you're-putting-meat-on-french-fries kind of way, but I don't think I'd recommend them.We tried to finish what we could, but did end up leaving most of the fries, a good portion of the souffle and some of the pork (which was cooked with raw egg and water in a copper vessel) behind. It killed my boss in the head, too, because she hates letting food go to waste.",0
21099,"I ordered the Pineapple Cashew Vegetables entree with tofu and brown rice, which was good (nothing fantastic) and flavorful (spicier than expected), but the sauce was very heavy. We asked about other vegan entree options and there were barely any - neither of the curries were vegan, which I've never experienced before at a Thai restaurant. My friend ordered the Pad Thai with tofu made vegan (without egg and fish sauce) and it was absolutely flavorless - they even brought her hot sauce and soy sauce to flavor it since there was basically nothing in it. Please make more of your options vegan friendly! I would be happy to return if so. Be aware that they only accept cash and American Express!",0
10173,"I'm torn between Four and Five Stars. It was a very good experience. I misread Oatmeal Pancakes and felt that the Almond taste in the Pancakes was very sweet. The portions are huge and texture was heavenly. I asked for a lot of butter and got it. It's a great breakfast restaurant. Although it wasn't packed full of customers, for a weekday there was a good crowd. The atmosphere is trendy and modern. Plain decor with a hInt of NYC. Some City photos on one wall. It's a spacious room airy and open. It's very clean and staff were very well trained. A friendly hostess welcomed me as soon as I walked in the door. I immediately felt comfortable. I was seated at a nice table for two. In a moment my waiter brought water and asked if I wanted anything to drink. Then my food waiter came and took my order. Before I knew it a beautiful plate of very hot Oatmeal Almond Pancakes appeared. Meanwhile I made acquaintance with the lady next to me. She let me Photo her Spinach Feta Omelette. Her omelette came with toast also. You can see my beautiful pancakes in my photos. Nothing stopped me from eating the whole plate. They have a beautiful bar if you prefer to just have drinks. In the rear is the bathroom. Appears to be unisex. They take credit cards and my waiter handled the payment. You can be assured I will return and try other Pancakes and the waffles! For an extra $2.50 you can have coffee and juice with your breakfast. Breakfast is served until 11am. I'm going to check out their lunch menu next time I walk by. I'm also going to bring my daughter and other guests. It's a great place for brunch. I bet it's packed on weekends!",0
14584,"After an unexpectedly lengthy two-hour wait for a table, my friend and I took our chances with the bar seating at this bustling restaurant. To our delight, the bar staff was exceptionally sweet and attentive, turning what could have been a frustrating experience into a quite pleasant one.

We weren't terribly hungry, so we decided to share a couple of small dishes—the curry puffs and the chicken pad Thai. Both dishes were an absolute treat to the taste buds, striking that perfect balance between comfort food and exotic flavors. It was refreshing to find a menu that catered not only to my preference for traditional Thai cuisine but also offered ""American"" options to satisfy a wider range of palates.

The charm of the restaurant, combined with the delicious food and the attentive staff, has left a lasting impression. In fact, I'm so enamored with the place that I'm considering it as the venue for my birthday party next year. It promises to be a spot where good friends can come together and celebrate over great food.",1
18579,"2 stars because I would only come back if it was a special occasion suggested by someone else.I came here for a friend's birthday for dinner on a Monday night. We made a reservation just in case, but the place wasn't completely packed so you can just walk in and probably have a short wait time if anything. The ambiance of the restaurant is nice. There is a chocolate gift shop at the entrance and you can see people making the desserts on the left.As for the food, I got a classic burger which tasted pretty good. I don't typically like pickles but the pickles in the burger was a bit sweet so it worked for me. The burger also came with fries and an orange sauce which was pretty good too. The major downside of this place was that everything is so overpriced. For the quality and quantity, it is not worth the price I paid. The burger was just a typical burger that came with 10 pieces of waffle fries at most and I'm high balling it. For the same quality, I could've gone to Shake Shack and gotten more toppings for half this price.My friends decided to share onion rings as an appetizer and it was $9. They tasted good, but each onion ring basically came close to $1 a piece. As for the desert, we got the whole dessert pizza. You get to choose two toppings for each half so we did hazelnut chunks and marshmallows on one half and banana and peanut butter on the other. The dough was soft and almost bread-like consistency. The banana and peanut butter was decent. Sweet, but manageable. The hazelnut and marshmallows on the other hand, one bite and I thought I would be at risk of diabetes. Very very very sweet. Almost painful to finish the slice sweet. Final thoughts: overall, everything tasted fine. If they could just increase the portion size slightly or improve the quality of the meal in some , I wouldn't mind it here, but the quality and quantity did not justify the price at all. This just felt like an expensive Cheesecake Factory.",0
13994,"I recently stopped by this bustling sports bar for a beer and was immediately struck by its good energy and lively ambiance. Upon entering, I was warmly greeted by Adam, who was notably friendly and attentive throughout my visit. The bar boasted an impressive selection of 20 beers on tap along with a full, colorfully presented bar. I decided on the BK Defender IPA, which was flavourful, though it could have been enhanced with a chilled pint glass. With plenty of TVs around, this place definitely marks itself as a fun spot to catch a game.",1
15409,"- Came here for brunch- LOVED the aesthetics- Florist in the front, restaurant right behind- Every dish incorporates a floral ingredient- We got the lavender latte, buckwheat waffle and flat iron steak- The lavender latte was so refreshing and the steak was sublime, would definitely come back for both- Wasn't a fan of the buckwheat waffle, too dry for me - We checked out their little shop in the front while we waited for our food- About 30min wait for the food to come out- The restaurant wasn't packed at midday- Heard their dinner menu is quite different- One thing that absolutely drove me nuts was their AC. It actually feels like a strong wind indoors. We asked if they could turn it down since at one point it got really cold. By the end of the meal I was sick of having the air blowing against me and my hair flying all over. I chose to eat indoors for a reason.- I would definitely return, but sit in a different spot to avoid the AC. Food is good though.",0
10287,Just stopped here for lunch with a work colleague after a friend suggested this place. It was close to work so I decided that I must try it. I was really excited and it was worth the excitement. We got there early before noon and our waiter seated us immediately. He was very friendly. My colleague was disappointed that we didnt get the booth because those were already reserved. The waiter noticing his disappointment came over and asked we could take the booth if we leave before 1.45 since that's when the reservation was for. We came here on a lunch break from work and were not planning to stay beyond 30 min so it worked for us. The waiter also sold us on the food. He knew how to give suggestions and it was worth it. We got the cheese burger and the balloni sandwich. The cheese burger with egg was delicious and we enjoyed it. It was a fatty day for us and a good lunch makes you a happy person at work.,0
14182,this place is delicious and reasonably priced! There can be a long wait but we came at a little after opening (11:30 am) on Sunday and didn't wait. The crust is super thin and crisp so it doesn't feel as heavy as a normal pizza. I definitely recommend the tie dye (it's a fan favorite for a reason) and the we had the arugula (it was better than we both expected! Love the balsamic) service was great as well!,0
1866,"THIS PIZZA IS AMAZING. I've pizza toured NYC hitting all the popular spots but this has definitely made my top five. Crust is crispy and thin (obviously you have to like thin crust to consider this place), sauce:cheese ratio is perfect, and icing on the cake is you can build your own personal pizza if you're with someone who doesn't like the same toppings. You can even split toppings down the middle. There's a happy hour until 6:30 which is also great. I'd definitely order from them in this current situation if they're accepting take out and visit again to try different types of pizza. I appreciate the kind staff as well.",0
16600,This ain't it. So I just got robbed for $5.00 foolishly misled into thinking that Detroit deep dish style pizza was worth spending $5 on. Wronggg. What I paid for was sauce on top of dough. Seriously there was about one inch/ 1 oz of a cheese layer on there! I like pizza a lot but I'm not one of those people who care about artisanal pizza or any fancy schmancy pizza. One look around and this is that type of place. If you are bringing Detroit style pizza to New York don't you think the pizza should almost knock a $2.75 regular ol slice out the water?! Nope. Old school Italian pizzeria that's serve cheesy greasy pizza for $2.50 it's just fine with me.,0

We kicked off our New Year's celebration with a pizza delivery from this remarkable restaurant and it didn't disappoint! Despite the holiday rush, they delivered our order in no time. The pizza was superb – truly deserving of a five-star rating. I highly recommend them for their prompt service and delectable pizza. A fantastic choice for any festive occasion!",1
15175,"Brunch at Scampi is a game-changer – they've taken their 5-star dinner experience and doubled the delight for early risers. Their menu breathes new life into brunch, steering clear of mundane offerings and instead delivering an explosion of creativity. Standouts include the fluke toast and the uovo scampi, which may very well come with the finest garlic bread known to humanity. Let's not forget the scampi Mafaldini pasta, a carryover from their dinner menu that still shines bright come morning. Sweet tooths will revel in the cannoli French toast and ricotta dishes, both scoring high on the 'very very good' scale. Service remains top-tier, and in an industry often forgetful of inclusivity, Scampi's commitment to accessibility – note the thoughtfully placed lowered bar seating – is a heartfelt nod to all guests. Brunch here isn't just a meal; it's an inventive spectacle.",1

10626,So delicious! Can't say enough great things about this spot. The ramen and broth were great!   I had the Shoyu ramen. Can't say enough about the broth...so rich and tasty!Prices were on par other spots. Run don't walk for an awesome bowl of ramen!,0
17816,"Had been eyeing this place for a while being that I love burgers. I ordered the Mexican wings, the American burger (medium rare) and the Oreo milkshake. The burger was cooked perfectly, exactly as ordered, it was delicious. The wings were tasty but let's face it, the real star of the show was the burger. The milkshake while delicious is such a mess, I don't think I would order that again lol but it was pretty tasty.",0
12929,"Wheeeee super excited for this new spot but overall was just okay for us. Maybe we ordered the wrong things.. Chicken Meatball - enjoyed the sauce but other than that nothing special, small portion. Squash - not overcooked which was great, flavor was nice mixture, enjoyed this dish. Pork Collar - quite disappointing, the sauce was very watery so it's really lack in flavor, there's A LOT of fat (30% at least) which we were not a fan of. Cocktails - tried 4 of them but all on quite on the light side stingy on ingredient type of cocktail trying to charge $16Uhmmmmmm",0
17018,"Title: A Quick Bite of Authenticity at Los Tacos #1 – Absolutely Worth the Hype!

After eagerly anticipating a visit to Los Tacos #1, reputed as a shining star in Chelsea Market's food scene, my tastebuds finally had their fiesta. True to its acclaim, this gem serves up the most authentic Mexican/California street food that's made fresh upon order – and let me say, it does not disappoint.

The moment you approach, you're swept away by the alluring scent of fresh pork, chicken, and other meats sizzling on the grill, seasoned to perfection. Despite the typically long line, which speaks volumes of the quality on offer, the service was remarkably speedy so we didn't miss a beat before our theater plans.

We devoured our well-seasoned, hot-off-the-grill tacos with glee. Each bite was a mouthful of pure joy, leaving us wanting more. Although we had to rush off, we're already planning our next visit.

Thank you, Los Tacos #1, for living up to your legendary status. See you again very soon for another round of your supreme tacos!

Sincerely,
Two very satisfied customers (who agree you're rightly named #1)! #YES!!!",1
14608,"Stopped by here for a quick late afternoon brunch as there weren't too many people inside. Got two seats at the bar and were quickly given the menus.Brunch time has an unlimited Mimosa/Bellini options for $5, so got that to go along with the French Wrap ($12). Mimosa is about 75% sparkling wine and 25% orange-flavored concoction - a bit unbalanced but overall drinkable. Bellinis were a bit more even. For the food, the wrap is slightly toasted and stuffed with eggs, turkey bacon, spinach, mushroom, and goat cheese. Eggs are solid and the veggies stood out. Heavy on the goat cheese, which overpowered some bites but overall a solid meal. Side salad was your basic fare.Service was quick, and the guy behind the bar was able to get our refills without much wait. Decent spot for a quieter brunch (depending on timing).",0
16274,"Fun and vibrant addition to the Chinatown scene, this place is about open for a year now. It's always interesting to see the classics re-invented and kudos for trying to step up the game. Pho is all about the broth in my view and this visit, it definitely aimed to please. I ordered the classic pho which comes with the thinly sliced beef brisket. Instead of ordering the basic 8 hour broth, I splurged a bit and ordered the 16 hour broth base for a few bucks more. I was really considering the 25 hour broth for the premium cost but nah...The 16 hour broth was delicious and quite robust. You could taste the beef bones and it went down so smoothly. The generous portions of cut scallions and onions in the mix completely seals the deal. The only down side was the broth was boiling hot and so I couldn't dive in as quickly as I hoped. Given so, it also cooked my beef brisket way too quickly. I like it rare and pink, so by the time I got to it, they were all cooked. Thinly cut so timing is key. Oh well. Still very good brisket but not the way I'd like to eat it.The Thai Iced Tea had way too much ice but I liked that it was not overly sweet. It was quite enjoyable. And my dining companion really liked her Vietnamese Slow Drip coffee (a rich dark espresso blend). Smelled really good.I'll have to return to try the many other menu items. Everything looked good coming from the kitchen.",0
2408,I think it's safe to say i have a healthy obsession with the mighty mushroom roll! this branch of Beyond also has plenty of seating and a broad food menu in addition to the usual rolls. They also have happy hour deals and are super friendly and prompt for dining in order ordering to go!,0

15159,"Title: Fresh Air and Grilled Delights at a Local Eatery

Last Thursday evening, my dining companion and I were enticed by an open-air restaurant that promised a comfortable al fresco dining experience. Thankfully, the establishment did not disappoint in providing us with a cozy booth by the window upon our arrival.

Deciding to skip their wood-fired pizzas, I settled on the Grilled Salmon priced at $28 and accompanied the dish with a classic Bloody Mary for $9. The presentation of the salmon was notable with it being served over a bed of fresh greens and lentils, accented with a bright half lemon. The lentils were a highlight, having soaked up the savory flavors of the salmon, creating a harmonious blend of tastes. While the fish was grilled darker than expected, veering towards medium-well instead of the medium I requested, it was still enjoyable.

The Bloody Mary was fairly standard; a typical mix poured over a generous amount of ice, but it contained a satisfactory level of spirit to elevate the meal.

Our server was adequate, though somewhat persistent. He made repeated attempts to entice us into additional drinks and a dessert course, which we declined.

In summary, this dining spot is a reasonable choice in the area if you're in search of an open-air atmosphere with straightforward fare.",1
13621,"Very good vegetarian burger. I came in to see what the best of NYC veggie burgers really was. I was quite impressed with this offering. The pattie is very dense and savory. It breaks apart on the bite in a manner somewhere between falafel and meat. The toppings were classic burger toppings. They were fresh. The bun is soft and chewy, and not too much for the patty.",0

At first we were hesitant but then a couple walked out and told us it was amazing so we decided to try it. We were only starting to get hungry so we got the mozzarella tomato basil bruschetta and penne tre porcellini to share between two!! Bruschetta came pretty fast. Tomatoes were super juicy and slightly garlicky and the bruschetta was quite big. Bread was slightly soggy but together it was all amazing. There was free bread with vinegar and olive oil. The pasta was AMAZING!!! Super creamy with prosciutto, pancetta and spicy sausage!!! I love the flavor and how well the meats mix with the creamy sauce. The creamy sauce balance out the saltiness of the meats and the portions were quite decent so overall we loved this place!! Definitely will be coming back to try their other dishes",0
1197,"I've been hooked on this Thai gem ever since my first visit three weeks ago. The ambiance strikes a delightful balance between whimsical and stylish, making it an equally good spot for a casual date or a meal with friends. Service here is as attentive as it gets, contributing to the pleasant experience.

Their menu boasts a variety of well-priced options, but the lunch special is a true steal. I indulged in their drunken noodles with beef, ramping up the flavor with extra sweet chili sauce – I just can't resist it! The spiciness was on point, enhancing rather than overpowering the dish. Accompanied by charming little spring rolls and served in generous portions, it was a meal that satisfied in all respects.

And here's a bonus: they have wifi! Whether you're in for a quick bite or a leisurely lunch, this place checks all the boxes. No complaints here, just eagerness for my next visit.",1
14491,"I went here with a few coworkers after a holiday party. We absolutely LOVED the surf bar decor. However, the drinks were super watered down.

I dined solo at the bar during Restaurant Week and was treated to exceptional service. My meal commenced with a Sliced Tomato with Blue Cheese, which was a delightful appetizer. The highlight was the Filet, cooked to perfect medium-rare tenderness – surprisingly fork-tender, a rarity for my experiences with filet. The Horseradish Mashed Potatoes were boldly seasoned, a hit for horseradish fans but a word of caution for those less inclined. The meal concluded with a velvety Chocolate Mousse, a sweet finale to a splendid dining experience. The Restaurant Week pricing only enhanced the value of the high-quality meal I enjoyed. Highly recommended.",1
3165,"Title: Vermicelli Victory at Madame Vo

Ventured into Madame Vo on the heels of Grub Street's high praise, aiming for their famed Pho but the Vermicelli Bowl sidetracked me — and what a delightful detour it was! The dish was a masterful blend of health and flavor, with its fresh mint, cucumber, and the crunch of peanuts and fried garlic. I opted for the honey glazed pork, which was both plentiful and succulent, perfectly balancing sweetness with savory.

Remarkably, service matched the food in impressiveness. My meal arrived within five minutes, and the attentive staff ensured my hydration was never compromised. Although the Vermicelli Bowl could easily become a repeat order, my eyes are set on the wider menu for my next visit — and of course, that signature Madame Pho won't elude me again.",1
16232,"I had a wonderful experience at this restaurant. Despite not having a reservation, I was seated promptly, likely due to it being early. The place quickly filled up after. The service was efficient, with the server making great menu recommendations. The food stood out for its freshness and flavor, particularly the chicken noodle soup, which had a rich broth and a nice touch of heat courtesy of fresh chillies served on the side. I would gladly return and recommend this spot to others.",1
3551,"Nestled beneath the bustling Chelsea Market lies a true hidden gem of a restaurant. First impressions can be deceiving, as the stunning bar area is just the tip of the iceberg. Wander further, and you're greeted by an expansive and lively space that unfolds like a secret, complete with a striking communal table for forty as its centerpiece.

The ambiance is effortlessly cool, making it the perfect backdrop for a gastronomic adventure. The menu is an array of delights, with the tuna tartar rolls and succulent spare ribs getting your taste buds going. While the lobster rice was unremarkable, Raul's dumplings were the star of the show. The sliced filet mignon arrived perfectly grilled, drenched in a sauce that was nothing short of divine, and the monkey bread dessert was a regal finish to a royal feast.

This place is an enchanting discovery, one that beckons for repeated visits. A truly enchanting culinary experience awaits within this urban cavern.",1
18200,"Title: A Local Gem Rediscovered

In a time when supporting local businesses has never been more important, I recently had an experience that reminded me why I fell in love with this neighborhood restaurant in the first place. After a period of decline, they've bounced back in a big way, as evidenced by my latest order: a perfectly grilled chicken caesar salad and a classic grilled cheese with fries for my dad. Both dishes were spot-on. 

The caesar salad, in particular, deserves praise for its revamped dressing – a delightful balance that avoided the all-too-common pitfall of creaminess. And the food arrived not just on time but early, carried by a delivery person whose friendliness was so appreciated that I gladly gave a $10 tip.

Every item was served hot and fresh, reviving my faith in this establishment. I'm already looking forward to my next meal, and a big shoutout to the staff who made this experience a standout. Keep it up!",1
1750,"After years of anticipation, I finally dined at this long-awaited Ukrainian restaurant. The service was commendable, with polite staff and a particularly humorous waiter enhancing the experience. Unfortunately, the culinary offerings failed to impress. The borscht skewed overly sour, failing to meet the rich, nuanced flavors of traditional homemade versions. The steamed lobster and crabmeat pirogis, while an innovative twist, were merely adequate in taste. The bigos provided some redemption with its decent quality.

However, the presence of flies and an alarming sighting of a roach detracted significantly from the overall ambiance. While the restaurant’s 24/7 operation is a unique feature not commonly found in Ukrainian eateries, the quality of the dining experience suggests exploring alternative options might be worthwhile.",1
13356,"Title: A Spicy Surprise and Potent Pours at Tacos & Tequila Haven

Upon entering the restaurant with a craving for tantalizing tacos and masterful margaritas, I was not only met but surpassed in my gastronomic expectations. The culinary journey began with an array of three distinct tacos, each delivering an unexpected but wholly welcomed spicy punch. Despite not having requested the extra heat, the zesty flavors enhanced my experience, with the beef taco taking the crown as my unequivocal favorite.

Complementing the fiery feast were the formidable drinks - notably potent, yet pleasing to the palate. The standout was the ""Pink Flower,"" an ingenious concoction that married frose with a classic margarita, resulting in a refreshingly divine twist that captured my taste buds' full attention.

A slight misstep was encountered with the guacamole, which, while flavorful, lost its partner in the overly salty and regretfully dry chips; a mishap that led to the guac's premature retirement from our table.

Despite this minor hiccup, the service was swift and efficient, ensuring my cravings were swiftly quenched. Satisfaction guaranteed, I am eager to return for another round of those spicy delights and to discover what other treasures lie within their robust drink selection.",1
14029,"TLDR: Fantastic views, incredible service and expensive. It will work for a business lunch that you're expensing. If you're on your own dime, there are better options to be had.Came here with a colleague to give it a try. The space is beautiful, probably one of the nicer views at Hudson Yards. The concept here is Asian fusion, the website calls it East meets West. They offered both tap or sparkling complimentary, nice touch. Our server was incredibly attentive, knowledgeable and checked in with us at the right times.We opted for the business lunch ($29) with some supplements and the Dim Sum Platter. For appetizers we got:Yellowfin Tuna Crudo - Very small portion. It had a light sear on the edges and sits in this soy sauce vinaigrette. There are some baby figs that compliment the dish well. Seasoning was a bit bland and the cut of tuna could've been better. I'd expect it to be better at an establishment like this. Every slice had this sinew that made it quite unpleasant.Seared Spanish Octopus - This was cooked very well but the char was more than I'm accustomed to. Blackened to the point where some bites were very bitter. The smoked paprika sauce it came with was enjoyable, it also had quite a bit of heat. Probably a bit too much for someone with a low tolerance.Dim Sum Platter - This seemed to be a signature item. I did not enjoy this. Three different types, two pieces of each; not a lot for $22. The Shrimp and Bacon Siu Mai was very plain. I'd have expected more bits of a bacon but my piece just had a slice of bacon laid on top of the siu mai. It was basically a slice of bacon fat. Seemed kind of lazy and wasn't sure where they were going with this. Foraged Mushroom Dumpling, decent. Mapo Tofu Dumpling - this did not remind me of mapo tofu at all. Other than the tofu, nothing made me think of mapo tofu. Entrees we ordered were:Black Angus Bavette - Decent but was just a steak basically. Nothing special. I enjoyed the watercress salad more than the meat. Thankfully I saved the sauce from the octopus and dipped my slices of steak in that.Artic Char - Was not a fan of this. The skin wasn't crispy, the fish was very small, the bottom of the plate was way too oily. The potatoes were at the bottom to rest the fish so those also become quite greasy.So while the set lunches were on par with the other restaurants in Hudson Yards, I didn't feel like I got much value here. The food was relatively mediocre for Asian fusion. The service was good enough and the fact that the dinner menu has different items, that maybe I could give it one more shot. Bottom line though, didn't feel like the quality or value was there.",0
15702,"Title: A Pleasant Surprise at a Cozy Spot

I recently dined at a local restaurant that surpassed all my expectations. The experience kicked off on a high note with a complimentary trio of hummus, accompanied by the most delectably fresh bread - such a welcoming gesture!

Our shared starter, the ahi tuna, was a symphony of freshness, perfectly paired with avocado and a tantalizing vinaigrette that had us thoroughly impressed. For our mains, my husband indulged in the special lobster tortellini, which was divine, and I savored the 'Taty crustacean' - both dishes were the epitome of culinary delight.

Our evening concluded with a scrumptious cannoli, an ideal sweet note to end a perfect dining experience. The service was commendable, attentive without being intrusive, and the ambiance of the restaurant was cozy and intimate, perfect for a relaxed meal.

Overall, it was an absolutely satisfying dinner that left us wanting nothing more. I wholeheartedly recommend this gem for an impressive meal in a welcoming environment.",1
1598,"Title: A Slice of the Big Apple at Its Best

If you're seeking the quintessential New York pizza experience, look no further. I was tipped off by a friend about this bustling spot claiming to have the best white slice in the city, and it did not disappoint.

Speed is the name of the game here; know what you want before you step up to order because they won't wait for you to decide. The moment you enter, be ready to call out your choice. The rhythm of this place is part of its charm—quick service and you're immediately part of the flow.

The pizza itself? Exceptional. Each slice was a testament to why this place has its reputation; generous in size, perfectly charred, and utterly satisfying. Two slices and you're set.

Yes, at $5-7 per slice, it's not the cheapest—but it's absolutely worth it for a genuine taste of New York. The place is a local legend and always packed, so brace yourself for a crowd. But trust me, it's a small price to pay for a great bite in the heart of the city.",1
14361,"This was on my list to try as we were heading to NYC for a weekend & I was very excited. It is said to be an Asian fusion restaurant and ""fusion"" usually doesn't always meet my standard, this place did. We didn't reserve and kinda walked in right before the rush started. The decor is very cute, farm-inspired (Red Farm duh!!!!) The staff was very nice and friendly, very helpful.Along with the regular menu, we also got the special Lunar New Year one. Everything sounded yummy but we settled on starting with lemongrass red sangria, Korean rice cake with pork belly & Chinese sausage, crispy skin chicken & garlic, mussels with eggplant & okra and finished off with some delicious warm Chit Cha Toddy. Everything was delicious except we found the pork belly to be less than pleasant as all the pieces were all fat. I definitely recommend :) i would go back again to try the other stuff on the menu!",0
13954,"I love this place! I always get the steamed chicken dumplings. They are expensive ($10.35 for 6 dumplings so it's not that filling) and to be completely honest, you can get a full meal for $10- so I don't go as often as I crave but they are good. Its always best to call and order ahead for this location, they are usually busy",0
13091,"I recently visited a spot claiming some of the best street tacos in the United States, and it did not disappoint. The tortillas, made fresh as you order, provide an authentic and delightful base for the exceptionally tasty meat that's tender and perfectly seasoned. Despite the inevitable line, the mouthwatering experience is worth the wait, and I'm already looking forward to my next visit.",1
17553,"After passing by this spot numerous times, curiosity got the better of me on a chilly day when I found myself ravenous on my way back to the office. Opting to finally give it a try, I was slightly disappointed to discover they were out of two of their four signature broths. I settled on the chicken broth, which started off a bit too salty but mellowed out as I continued sipping. It was comforting and definitely hit the spot, yet left me wanting more. This is a novelty option for lunch that's great for an occasional treat, but at $7 for a small cup, don't expect it to fill you up. You'll likely need to invest in a more substantial side to satisfy your hunger.",1
11555,"I was initially thinking it must be lonely to be a Japanese restaurant in Koreatown, perhaps the only one, but then I read later that it's part of a Korean restaurant chain that serves Japanese-style curry. Oh OK, that makes sense geographically but of course, as someone from the other side of the Sea of Japan, I tend to make unfair comparisons with my mom's curry because that's what I was raised on in California, for better or worse. This was not my mom's curry. It's all about choices here. First, you have to decide between curry rice, curry noodle, and the decadent-sounding cream curry pasta.Rice for me, traditionalist that I am, though I would have liked a steamed cauliflower rice option. Then you decide the level of spiciness, five discrete levels presumably designed to test your manhood even if you're a woman. Since they gave the basic level the patronizing label of ""Baby Level"", I couldn't have my manhood and went for ""Level 1: Mild"". Game on. Jamie W. ordered the $9.99 Vegetable Curry Rice at the same Level 1 spiciness and had them add the complimentary green onion and the $4.99 Chicken Cutlet, large and fried as it was (photo: bit.ly/2KqQMLI).I went for the $11.99 Mushroom Curry Rice with the aforementioned wimpy spiciness, copied Jamie's add-on of the free green onions but went for the $2.99 Potato Croquettes (photo: bit.ly/31z48ex). I think my croquettes were a more satisfying choice than the cutlet which amounted to another entree. However, we both agreed on the state of the curry - just too watery. My mom used to put in a bit of cornstarch or whatever the Japanese version of it, and it was indeed the thickness that I missed. Oh well, we were stuffed at least. They just need to get their curry mama back there in the kitchen.FOOD - 3 stars...not my Japanese okasan's curryAMBIANCE- 3.5 stars...pretty spacious for a K-Town spot and full of loud Asian youthSERVICE - 3.5 stars...efficient though not very personableTOTAL - 3 stars...come hungry and be clear on your spice tolerance levelRELATED - Hungry in NYC?

11748,"Title: Hearty Lunch Specials and Tasty Treats at Local Gem

I recently dropped by this eatery for a weekday lunch and was pleasantly surprised to find no wait time. I opted for the #26 beef chow fun lunch special which was quite the delight with its generous meat portions and tasteful seasoning. Although a tad oily, it wasn't overly salty and came with a comforting side of soup.

The #22 sticky rice hit all the right notes—flavorful, perfectly cooked, and neither too mushy nor too firm—it quickly became my favorite dish of the day. Sadly, the #25 Shanghai juicy pork bun didn't quite live up to expectations; the buns weren't as juicy as anticipated, and the dough was on the thicker side.

I was also a bit let down by the #20 chicken feet, which were firmer than the preferred tenderness. On a brighter note, the #33 duck spring roll was a novel indulgence for me and didn't disappoint with its delectable flavors.

All in all, two of us dined heartily for just $50. Despite a couple of minor critiques, the generous portions and overall taste make for a solid lunch spot I'd recommend.",1
10804,"This is a new sushi place that is a welcomed addition to the neighborhood. It's set up like a bar similar to Kazunori, but you can actually make a reservation! They have different order sets for different amount of hand rolls. The prices are actually more expensive than Kazunori's. Six hand rolls at Kazunori for 29 dollars including tip while at Douzo, you can get 6 for 35 dollars, not including tip. I ended up getting the 65 dollars omakase so I can't really say if the hand rolls are comparable or better, but I did try the crunch tuna hand roll, which was pretty good. The omakase for 65 dollars came with miso soup that had cauliflower, which was not typical, but a wonderful healthy addition to the soup. It also came with a silken tofu that was pretty decent. I have not done a lot of omakase before, but the friends I went with were impressed with the quality for the price. They all agreed that this was at least a 4/5 experience and would come again.",0
12854,"My experience here was short and sweet! Well... technically short and savory ;)If you don't read anything else, walk away knowing this place offers tiny bacon table fires to warm your hearts and hanger!!!!My friend and I were looking for a really casual, warm, relaxing, friendly spot that was open a little later than we planned for and had affordable, fast, bite-size dinner options that were gluten sensitive, low-carb, dairy-free, low-sugar... all sorts of food sensitivities. The servers were attentive and sharp; knowledgeable about their items. And the location seemed accessible for different body types! I didn't check the bathroom though. Not only was this place an impromptu & worthwhile dinner spot, the drink we shared was INCREDIBLE. Someone liquified spring and distilled it into an inventive 3-ingredient cocktail... Mito Garden: yuzu sake, dill soju, bitters... it was beyond fantastic.",0
16115,"Came here for the first time with a friend who really likes The Boil and I definitely enjoyed it. i got shrimp and snow crab legs along with some rice noodles to sop up the sauce. We got it with their signature sauce which was very rich and garlicky. The sauce is really what makes it addictive, but I do have to say that their sauce is quite heavy. I felt it the next day for sure and the garlic definitely lingers around for a while even after brushing my teeth. Service was good. They also provide you with gloves and bibs to make sure you aren't getting sauce or food everywhere. They also clear the plate of shells pretty often so you don't constantly have a pile in front of you. I do have to say that it gets quite packed here, so it's best to make a reservation, but we were lucky since we were a group of 2 so we got a table pretty quick.",0
14549,"Visiting Prince Street Pizza was a must-do on my NYC culinary checklist, and it didn't disappoint. The spicy pepperoni slice is legendary for a reason – one slice is generously sized and satisfyingly thick, a departure from the typical New York thin crust, but a welcome one. The crust crunches with perfection, and although the pepperoni cups are oil-laden, each mouthful is so flavorful, the oil becomes an afterthought. Two slices were more than enough to leave me full. If you're showing someone new around the city and want to impress with an excellent slice of pizza, Prince Street Pizza should be high on your list.",1
11776,"SUPER staff, really friendly and attentive. And the food was really, really great! (We were here for lunch and to watch a Penn State football game - they are THE Penn State bar in NYC). Empanadas app and Chicken Tacos entrée were both wonderful. Husband had a blackened Scotch salmon entrée that he said was absolutely BEAUTIFULLY done...lots of sautéed fresh spinach on a nice serving of mashed potatoes that at first he had no intention of even touching... yeah, they all disappeared.  Bathrooms nice and clean (not an easy feat on a college football Saturday).

In an hour the room was filled. Mostly convention people, families, tourists, students. The raw oysters and calamari were amazing. Got the combination seafood pan roast..fresh ingredients and tasty. Tried my friend's blackened grouper with potatoes and vegetables. Delicious. They don't make their food spicy but you can add hot sauce with a bottle from the table. Highly recommended as a tourist attraction.",0
18516,"During New York's restaurant week, my friends and I decided to check out a fantastic dining spot that boasted a great deal for the occasion. Upon arrival, we were welcomed by the downstair establishment's hostess, offering a much-appreciated coat check service to relieve us from the burden of our hefty winter attire.

We kicked off the evening at the bar, where a satisfactory Happy Hour was in full swing, with an appealing selection of wine and bites perfect for anyone looking to unwind after a busy day. The appeal of their Happy Hour has me already planning a return visit.

When it came to the restaurant week menu, a delightful three-course meal was on offer. My appetizer was shrimp, followed by a branzino entree, and I wrapped up with a decadent chocolate mousse cake accompanied by vanilla ice cream for dessert. While the shrimp's sauce didn't quite hit the mark for me, the rest of the meal was a culinary delight—I didn't leave a scrap behind. The branzino, recommended by our waiter, was particularly exceptional and his service was noteworthy; despite not recalling his name, his attentiveness and recommendations contributed significantly to our dining experience.

Even on a bustling Wednesday evening, the service remained top-notch, ensuring a memorable dining experience.",1
19974,"Title: Cozy Greenwich Gem – Sotto Shines with Flavor

Review:

Absolutely smitten with Sotto, a charming find in the heart of Greenwich Village. The ambiance sets a welcoming scene, complemented by an enticing drink menu and a delightful array of dishes. The pizza, an unexpected star at a place not famed for it, impresses with its flavor and quality, defying the usual mediocrity of non-specialist joints.

The hunger-quenching highlight was the short rib gnocchi—a dish confirming Sotto's culinary prowess with its robust and satisfying taste. A slight drawback was the pace of service, which could benefit from a bit more briskness. Nonetheless, Sotto has won a place in my heart, and I'm eager to return to explore more of their sumptuous offerings.",1
14855,"Title: Promising Experience at Taboga During Bustling Private Event

My evening at Taboga was a unique one, as the restaurant was bustling during a private event coinciding with Happy Hour, leading to a full house. Despite the chaos, our waitress showcased exceptional patience and professionalism. Even when I presented her with some attitude due to a misunderstanding, she returned promptly with a gracious smile and a swift resolution, an impressive display of customer service.

Given the event's demands, service was understandably slower - drinks, food, and bills took their time to materialize. As for the food, it was a culinary delight, complemented by satisfying drinks. The music was the evening's low note, though I'm uncertain if it was chosen by Taboga's DJ or the event organizers.

I am eager to return to Taboga to experience their standard brunch or a regular evening. This visit provided a glimpse of their quality and service, and I'm curious to see if the ambiance holds up under normal circumstances.",1
3623,"Title: Late Night Feast at [Restaurant Name]

Last night, my family and I ventured into [Restaurant Name] around midnight, hungry and eager to indulge in what would become a memorable dining experience. Among the dishes we ordered were the peach salad, fried chicken and waffles, corn with lobster, and pork belly nuggets.

Despite a bit of a wait, the food did not disappoint. Each dish was delicious, winning my family's approval. The standout for me was the corn and lobster combination—truly a dish I'd return for. The fried chicken and waffles also earned high praise, thanks to their supreme juiciness and tenderness.

However, not everything hit the mark. The pork belly nuggets fell short on flavor and were somewhat forgettable. It's the one item I'd advise first-timers to skip, as it was sadly the only dish that remained uneaten on our table.

This place has the potential to offer an excellent brunch, yet it was just as impressive in the wee hours. I would definitely recommend [Restaurant Name] for a satisfying late-night bite.",1
2857,"The veggie ramen was very creamy and delicious. I think it's my favorite veggie ramen in NYC thus far. We also got the fries, which are battered and fried purple yams with ketchup. This was delicious as well. As you might expect, it's not too hard to hear the conversation of your neighbors. The service was fast.",0

The Popcorn Chicken certainly stood out as quite authentic and satisfying, although it didn't quite reach the pinnacle of perfection.

Overall, a solid choice for anyone craving a good fry-up.",1

18098,"Title: A Taste of Authenticity at Luu's Vietnamese

If you ever find yourself wandering near 23rd and Park with a hankering for Vietnamese flavors, Luu's is a must-visit. As a regular for over seven years, I've come to cherish this modest midtown gem for its consistently satisfying meals and, notably, the warm-hearted aunties who run it daily.

Their ability to remember regulars' orders, such as my go-to to-go buns and ca phe sua nong, adds a personal touch that transforms a simple meal into a familiar experience. The service is always swift, making it the perfect spot for a quick lunch or a leisurely break.

The bánh mì paired with a ca phe sua da is my recommendation for a filling and reasonably priced meal. The portions are generous, particularly the bánh mì, which is loaded with veggies and larger than most. It's a straightforward, no-frills establishment serving traditional fare, so don't expect gourmet twists or specialty coffee—they stick to the basics like Cafe du Monde, and they do it right.

While the spice level isn't adjustable, the flavors are authentic, and the bakery offerings, including hot dog buns and various filled baos, are a delightful bonus. As a testament to its authenticity, Luu's is frequented by students from nearby schools such as Baruch, SVA, and NYU.

They accommodate both cash and card payments (with a minimum), offer a restroom, and boast ample seating with additional space next door. In summary, Luu's is a genuine Vietnamese spot offering heartwarming food that's sure to satiate your appetite until dinner. Bon appetit!",1
18736,"Title: Spicing Up Your Feed and Your Palate

If you're looking to tantalize your taste buds while scoring some Insta-worthy ambiance, this spot might just be your new go-to. My friend and I popped in on a bustling Wednesday evening, and the 30-minute table wait was a minor hiccup easily spent unwinding with a massage nearby.

Once seated, the décor transported us straight to a charming Chinese village, complete with enchanting lanterns and picturesque awnings. The staff was refreshingly attentive, keeping our glasses full and our table happy throughout the dining experience.

Now, let's talk about the star of the show: the food. The Fried pig's intestine was the table favorite, boasting an ideally crispy texture that left us craving more. The spicy chicken followed suit, though the hefty dose of red pepper flakes was slightly overwhelming. Pairing these dishes with rice (note the extra charge) might ease the heat for those less adventurous.

The spicy tofu, however, was a bit of an oil pit, requiring a quick blot before indulging. It didn't steal the spotlight like the meat dishes, but it did provide a nice complement to them when paired with the side of veggies.

Capping the meal with complimentary red bean desserts was a sweet touch. Although the bill came to a slightly steep $42 per person after tipping, the overall experience justified the price tag—quality service, inviting atmosphere, and a lively crowd.

While this restaurant has earned a spot on my dining list, I must admit that the appeal of trying out the latest hyped spots in the area might sway me from an immediate return. However, for a reliable mix of spice and style, this place holds its own.",1
11186,"Title: Mixed Feelings at [Restaurant Name]

Upon visiting [Restaurant Name], I entered with high hopes, especially for their ability to cater to my allium allergy, as confirmed during a reassuring phone conversation. Unfortunately, the dining experience fell short of expectations. The cocktail served was the highlight of the evening – a delightful concoction that signaled promise. However, the food failed to match up, with ""just ok"" being a generous assessment.

The real disappointment stemmed from the restaurant's miscommunication about their allergy-friendly options. Promised ""many"" by a phone representative, I was let down to discover only two allium-free entrees upon consultation with our waiter. This significant discrepancy greatly limited my dining experience and left me feeling misled; a sentiment that was further amplified when my chosen entree arrived with allium despite the precautions discussed.

In the end, the lack of attention to dietary needs culminated in an underwhelming meal of toast and jam – a dish that hardly needs a restaurant setting for better execution.

While the establishment may serve a fine cocktail, I would hesitate to recommend it for dining, particularly for those with specific dietary restrictions.",1
15711,"Title: Room for Improvement at a Decent Eatery

I recently visited a restaurant with ample food choices and an appealing outdoor seating area. Though a picturesque spot, patrons should note that outdoor dining comes with a no-alcohol policy. My experience was somewhat underwhelming, as the kitchen was inflexible with menu modifications; requests for additional protein on a salad or a simple substitution in their tacos were met with a flat denial. Service also left much to be desired, with a noticeable wait before staff attended to lingering dirty dishes. While the food was passable in taste, it didn't excite the palate. In summary, while the establishment has potential, a greater willingness to accommodate personal dietary preferences and improved service could elevate the overall dining experience.",1
20149,"Title: A Disappointing Slice of The Big Apple

As a seasoned New Yorker with a palate honed by the city's bustling pizza scene, my expectations for an exemplary pie are admittedly high. Unfortunately, my recent visit to this establishment was a letdown. The pizza, proclaimed to be a ""large"" pie, was misguidedly labeled, as it barely reached what many would consider medium in size.

The main event, the pizza itself, was a woefully bland affair. The sauce lacked the robust seasoning one anticipates in a quintessential slice, bearing an unsettling resemblance to the uninspired zest of canned varieties. While the crust managed to be the meal's sole redeeming feature, it was not enough to rescue the overall experience.

In a surprising misstep, slices weren't available for individual purchase, compelling us to commit to a large pie that failed to live up to its moniker. Accompanying breadsticks were a continuation of the meal's mediocrity, a basic offering paired with the same lackluster sauce that plagued the pizza.

In retrospect, this dining experience was a regrettable investment of both time and money. For those in search of authentic, flavorful pizza, I suggest looking elsewhere. This place does not rise to the occasion and is certainly not deserving of its hype.",1
1642,"Title: Brunch Bliss with a Side of Bacon Hiccup at [Restaurant Name]

I ventured into [Restaurant Name] for an 11am brunch on a quiet and foggy Saturday, expecting a crowd but instead was greeted by an empty restaurant, which allowed me to score a prime table by the window. The setting was serene—perfect for people-watching or basking in the diffused natural light.

Our server was the epitome of friendliness and attentiveness, ensuring our meal progressed smoothly. The menu offered a comforting array of classic brunch delights, from which we chose the much-lauded avocado toast and French toast.

The French toast was a triumph, featuring thick slices of bread hugged by luscious cream—a real treat for the taste buds. Meanwhile, the avocado toast presented a beautifully poached egg duo, with yolks that oozed satisfaction upon the first cut.

Unfortunately, the toast's accomplice, a bacon avocado mix, was the morning's misstep. The bacon's tough texture and overpowering presence clashed with the delicate avocado, stripping away the dish's potential harmony.

Despite this, [Restaurant Name] left a positive imprint on my brunch experience. While I'll be steering clear of the bacon-avocado fusion next time, I'm eager to return and explore more of what their menu has to offer.",1

20759,"Ohh Marta! I'm so sad, I really wanted to like this place because I typically love USHG spots and I love a crispy thin crust pizza. We started by wanting to sit at the bar in front of the pizza oven (who doesnt want a little something to look at while waiting for some crispy pizza) but were told no, even though it was totally empty and set with dinnerware. Whatever. We ordered two dirt wolf IPAs (which I'm a huge fan of as they are made by my hometown brewery, I was excited because it can be hard to find in NY) which were served so cold that they were almost completely flat and had little slivers of ice floating on them. Weird. We got the mushroom appetizer and the pizza w vodka sauce. The mushrooms were well seasoned and had a great texture but they needed to come with toast or something, a small pile of roasted mushrooms is more of a side than an appetizer. Also at $17....lol. But that was all ok because I was so ready for that ""cracker thin pizza they advertise."" Welp. We got a pretty flavorless soggy pizza. Maybe we ordered wrong because the ""vodka sauce"" tasted of nothing and maybe the standard pizza sauce has some flavor...but really, this pizza was so low quality I was pretty shocked. We ended up using a whole shaker or parmesan and a lot of red pepper flakes just to get some flavor. We wanted to try the amaro flights as dessert (cool concept and I love st agrestis amaro) but after waiting 10 minutes for our waiter to come back we decided we would wait 10 more minutes and then just get the check. Which is what happened. Sad because they have some fun happy hour deals but no discount is too deep to make me come back!",0

The ssam bap was quite good, being made of a nice fatty tuna and tasting like a delicious tuna hand roll.The ramyun was good as well, being quite flavorful and having nice bits of tasty kimchi to warm the taste buds.Overall a good restaurant with nice flavor choices and options.",0

Reading the menu before my friends arrive I realized, this place is Vegan.A little alarmed but intrigued I got the avocado burger and shockingly it was outstanding, a little spicy (that could have been the chipotle mayo I added) but nonetheless I'm into it. The sweet potato fries looked good as well but coming from the gym I decided against it.The layout is super casual, order and they will text you once it's ready to pick up at the counter. I kid you not it was packed with 80% woman in gym clothes.",0
19362,"Title: Satisfying Fusion Feast at Local Gem

I recently ventured to a local restaurant for lunch, intrigued by their unique offering of a BBQ and hotpot combo. The lamb for the hot pot was a tad thick for my liking but undeniably fresh. The fatty beef, on the other hand, was sliced to perfection – a hot pot highlight. With an extensive selection of sauces, customizing the hotpot to one's personal taste was a breeze.

The BBQ meats catered more to those with a penchant for sweetness, which may not suit everyone's palate. Personally, I prefer savory flavors, yet the pork belly BBQ was an exception. Its smoked taste was remarkable and quickly won me over. Another standout was the black pepper beef that struck a nice balance between spice and savor.

Dessert did not disappoint, with warm sweet rice accompanied by taro and tapioca – a comforting end to a hearty meal. Overall, despite some minor preferences in meat preparation, the experience was delightful with plenty of options to please diverse tastes.",1

2205,"Title: A Hidden Gem for Authentic Mexican Fare in NYC

If you're on the quest for authentic Mexican tacos akin to those in LA, look no further than this gem in the heart of NYC. Despite a bafflingly low Yelp rating, this spot deserves its due recognition. Their guacamole is consistently top-notch - the sort of saucey indulgence you'd relish in Mexico itself. The tacos? A revelation. Particularly the al pastor and lengua which, quite frankly, are unparalleled. Lately, I've been enamored with their soups, especially the spicy beef - tender short ribs that effortlessly part ways with the bone, swimming in a luxuriant beefy broth. This restaurant is an enduring favorite of mine, and it's high time it climbs to the top of your must-visit list.",1
15733,"Started with chips and salsa. Their salsa has a nice bite to it and is a nice level of heat. It is not mild, more towards a medium to hot. I ordered three tacos. Braised short ribs with refried beans, pico de gallo, crema & tamarind-pasilla sauce, Coca-Cola carnitas with radish, refried beans and avocado sauce, and Achiote Rubbed Chicken Guacamole & mole negro. The coca-Cola Carnitas was the only disappointment. The meat was chewy and in chunks and dried out. The Braised short rib was excellent. Juicy and lots of tamarind flavor. The pico gave a nice yin to yang balance with the tamarind. The winner overall was the achiote rubbed Chicken. This was Smokey and the Guacamole was excellent. The mole was a nice sauce for the flavors put forward. My friend had the chorizo and goat cheese quesadilla. I had bite of it and it great. Lots of meat and cheese spread evenly. I would definitely come back to this restaurant, I just would not get the carnitas again. Thanks for being a great spot to grab a quick bite before a show.",0

17758,"Title: Delicious Dim Sum, Service Needs Work

I recently visited this dim sum restaurant for the second time, drawn by the variety and quality of the food on offer. The lunch specials are particularly noteworthy for their generous portions and rich flavors. For the food alone, the restaurant earns four stars.

However, the experience was marred by the lackluster service. Each visit, I encountered an odd policy where only one staff member is authorized to seat guests, leading to unnecessary waiting and a lack of acknowledgment from other servers. Additionally, both times I dined, there was confusion with orders being mistakenly delivered to my table, which makes me question the attention to detail in service.

Despite the excellent cuisine, these repeated service issues are concerning, and regrettably, they've discouraged me from planning a return visit.",1
11250,"Title: Mixed Feelings at Fusion Eatery

Stopped by on a packed Friday evening for a dinner that was decent yet forgettable. The interior was pleasing, but our initial encounter with a rather patronizing host dampened the mood—his unnecessary comment on our dining habits was off-putting. We were also rushed by the staff throughout our meal, a constant interruption that made the experience less enjoyable.

The menu promised a fusion twist, but it delivered a punch of heat without the complexity of flavors one would expect from a higher-end spot. My bun bo hue was disappointingly one-note spicy and featured disappointingly tough cuts of meat, save for the ham. The standout dish was the Brussels sprouts, which were executed well. The extensive Asian beer selection was a plus.

In summary, the meal and experience didn't justify the premium prices, making it an unlikely go-to for future dining.",1
3614,"My dudes, come check out this modern Asian fusion situation. This has been on my ""to try"" list for ages and so glad I finally made it here! Went at 8:30pm in Friday and there was a ~30min wait. Once seated, we asked the waitress what she recommended. After many minutes of deliberation, we order exactly what she told us to. We got the pork jowl brussel salad, sizzling sisig, and khai soi , plus the Thai-lote corn on the side. Everything was INCREDIBLE. The pork/brussel salad was both mine and my friends favorite- the combo of the briny vinegarette plus the fatty pork jowl was delicious. Our waiter did talk us into getting rice on the side (hate when waiters do that!) but it ended up never being brought to the table and really wasn't necessary anyways. There is definitely a too cool vibe amoungst the wait staff... but truly that may be because they are very cool, they definitely look it, and everyone was friendly for the most part. HIGHLY RECOMMEND! (But not for vegetarians ).",0
12125,"This is a semi-tough review to write. Honestly, I think the sushi taste + quality here was more of a 3.5/5 but still solid omakase for a good value. I only wish I hadn't been to Sushi by Bou before trying this place bc if I hadn't, I probably would have been blown away. Instead, I found myself comparing the quality of the sushi and the taste to Sushi by Bou (Sushi by Bae's literal counterpart at its Union Sq location; they actually share the same omakase counter with two different omakase chefs. They also share the same bar / bartenders and cocktail menu). I did not know this before I made a reservation. If I had, I probably would have just stuck with Sushi by Bou (I say this a lot but it's my #1 omakase place in NYC). This review is tough bc I can't help but compare Sushi by Bae to Bou. I didn't know they have the same owner, share the space and basically, are the same restaurant. It's a little bit confusing + hard to compare when ultimately, Bae is just branding a separate omakase chef under the same exact style and vibe and sushi as Sushi by Bou. SETTING: Thursday night reservation made a month in advance for 9:00pm. The difference between Bou and Bae is it seems that Bou has expanded (with multiple locations in the city) and i've never been served by the actual man himself, David (last name). Sushi by Bae is only serviced by Oona (the omakase chef who founded Bae).Arrived to a full omakase counter (~ 12 seats) and several people hanging by the bar. Relatively small space with good music and the same type of location as Sushi by Bou's other locations (small, ""trendy"" locations, good music, lively crowd). Bring a sweater here tho bc it is COLD. FOOD: The omakase was good. Each and every piece wasn't as mindblowingly good as Sushi by Bou but couldn't put my finger on exactly what was missing. The favorites as always were the medium fatty tuna and the fatty tuna. But when it came time for us to order any extra pieces, we failed to come up with anything that was memorable or anything that got us get super excited. When we go to Sushi by Bou, we usually want to order every single piece twice (and almost have). SERVICE: Oona was great and really nice. But at the end of the day, as I've said above, this was exactly the same restaurant Sushi by Bou so it's like I'm just leaving another review for that place. Dinner here was 15 pieces for $110 for an hour and a half, while Bou is $50 for 10 pieces (30 minutes) or $125 for 17 pieces (I think) for an hour and half. Same gist and price range. VERDICT: worth trying if your desire is to hit every new omakase place in the city but if you can't get a res here, just do one at Sushi by Bou. Similar styles, taste and quality. Can't go wrong with either.",0
13471,"Title: A Hidden Gem in the Theater District

I'm typically conservative with my stars, but this charming spot earned all five. Discovered through New York Magazine, it's a culinary treasure near the theater district. Initially eyeing the escargot and beef bourguignon, I was won over by the irresistible prix fixe menu, featuring veal osso buco – an absolute revelation.

I missed out on the mixed vegetable soup, which my friend rightfully praised as ""soul-warming,"" but the taste I had was a burst of homey goodness. The experience left me eager to return, not just for the beef bourguignon but also to bask in the quaint decor and revisit the delightful flavors. This place is the definition of a hidden gem.",1
2612,"Nestled on the fringes of NYC's Koreatown, our recent outing to this authentic Korean BBQ spot was a delightful surprise. Despite the Saturday night bustle, we snagged a cozy table by the window without a reservation. Opting for the combo package, we feasted on an array of meats, including pork belly, spicy marinated pork, and both marinated and plain beef short ribs. The showstopper was the sukiyaki, cooked tableside, which was as entertaining as it was savory.

The service shines here; our waiter was attentive, constantly replenishing our Banchan (though lettuce seemed a rare treat). Meats were expertly cut and served, ensuring a seamless dining experience. For those looking to dodge the chaos of 32nd Street, this Korean BBQ haven is a must-try. It's the ideal blend of scrumptious cuisine and top-notch service without the typical wait times.",1

Opting for salmon and spicy tuna as my proteins, I found the fish notably fresh, with the salmon being particularly noteworthy. I added a diverse range of accompaniments such as crab salad, edamame, cilantro, jalapeño, and a selection of flavorful toppings like Hawaiian salt, scallion, tempura flakes, chili flakes, corn, sriracha aioli, and kizami nori, which resulted in a satisfying meal. At $12, the portion size delivered value for money. The variety of ingredients offered was impressive, allowing for a customizable dining experience. During my visit at 1:15pm on a weekday, the restaurant was pleasantly uncrowded with a short line.",1
16586,"Title: A Cozy Thai Treasure in Hamilton Heights

I recently discovered what might just be the best Thai restaurant in Hamilton Heights. Charming and welcoming, this new-ish gem was recommended by a local, and it certainly lived up to the praise. The interior is as delightful as the food, offering a snug atmosphere—with the thoughtful touch of charging plugs at bench seats for a modern dining convenience.

The cuisine here radiates authenticity and care. The rice paper rolls are a standout, delivering a burst of freshness without the heaviness. The pad woon sen, a lighter take on stir-fry, comes packed with veggies yet might leave those yearning for a heartier protein serving a touch underwhelmed. Nevertheless, it's a small quibble in what is otherwise a delightful meal.

In a neighborhood where fast food reigns, this Thai spot is a welcome oasis of flavor. Despite the light-handed protein portions, the overall quality and deliciousness make it a place worth revisiting.",1
10194,"Title: A Welcoming Korean Gem with Delicious Eats

I recently dined at a Korean restaurant that truly understands the importance of inclusivity, ensuring non-Korean speakers feel completely at ease. The Yelp waitlist was a new experience for me, and it proved to be efficient, with a wait time that was spot-on.

The culinary highlight was undoubtedly the tender marinated beef platter for two, which was cooked to perfection with a friendly waitress kindly assisting in the process. An adventurous twist to the meal was the green tea cold noodles, a dish that added an intriguing flavor profile to our dining experience.

Beyond the food, the drink selection brought joy to the table. The Lychee Soju Cocktail and Frozen Mango Bomb were stand-out choices, offering a sweet and refreshing complement to our meal. While a craft beer option like Shapiro would have been preferred, the available Coors did not detract from the overall enjoyment.

As for the setting, the restaurant's decor transported us to an enchanting Asian night market, striking a comfortable balance between ambiance and authenticity.

Pricing was reasonable, aligning with what one would expect in the area. If you're seeking an inviting Korean dining experience with a touch of modern flair, this is certainly a place to consider.",1

After a bustling night in New York, determination set the alarm for an early visit to the renowned Prince Street Pizza. With the city's endless culinary options, it’s a battle against time to savor every desired bite. The priority was set: experience the famous SOHO square-cut pepperoni pizza.

Arriving at 9:55 am to a manageable queue, I found myself eighth in line, surrounded by walls adorned with celebrity testimonials. This little pizza shrine makes the wait almost enjoyable, giving a hint of the prestige attached to their offerings.

With the West Coast still asleep, my body wasn’t yearning for food, but my determination didn’t waver. Soon enough, I was walking out, prized pizza in hand, snapping obligatory pictures before it could turn cold.

Back at the hotel with an awakened appetite, I unwrapped a spectacle of double-layered, crispy pepperoni atop a thick, yet surprisingly chewy crust - a shift for a thin-crust aficionado like myself. The first bite was a revelation. Robust sauce, perfect crust, and those divine pepperonis created an irresistible symphony of flavors.

Prince Street Pizza has redefined my pizza standards. It’s more than a meal; it's a must-have New York experience that beckons me back to the Big Apple, time after time.",1

Our waitress was awesome, super attentive and quick. Our nachos (ordered with no added meat) were delicious and just what we needed with our drinks. The menu has your typical options AND a wide variety of tacos. Chicken, beef, fish, and even cauliflower to name a few. My personal favorite was the fried shrimp, the crispy shrimp and soft tortilla was the perfect combo. The tacos are on the smaller side but with an appetizer you'll be golden. 6 drinks, order of nachos and 5 tacos came to $90.",0

2593,"Yelp recommended this place to me, and I was drawn in by the food photos on its page. It's pretty easy to get to, about 10 minutes walk from the subway. It's a pretty tiny shop, and they've done an unbelievable job making use of the space - they have outdoor seating and several indoor tables as well a bar. We both got the beef noodle soup with wide noodles, and my boyfriend got the rich + spicy while I got the spicy. This was an absolutely phenomenal bowl of noodles! The richness and depth of flavor of the broth, the chewiness of the noodles, and the absence of fat chunks on the beef made this one of the best beef noodle soups I've had. It really reminded me of bowls I had in Beijing! They were also SO nice here. It is a little pricey (it ended up being $45 for both of us including tip, and we only got the noodle soup) but I don't regret it in the slightest!! Give this place a try!!",0

The French Fries were not too greasy and had just the right crunch. Kids Grilled Cheese - amazing grilled cheese sandwich. The portion size was just enough. And it came with a side of fries.

12185,"Title: Hit-and-Miss Experience at Local Eatery

My dining experience at this restaurant started on a high note with prompt greetings and quick seating, but unfortunately took a sharp turn once the main course arrived. The initial service was impressive, as our server promptly took our drink orders and provided access to the salad bar, which was fresh and satisfying.

However, the steak I ordered was a massive disappointment, tough and reminiscent of ""mystery meat."" Our server was difficult to flag down for assistance, and while she did relay an offer from the manager for a complimentary dessert to make up for the unsatisfactory steak, the follow-through was lacking. We waited 30 minutes without the promised dessert or even the check.

Ultimately, we had to resort to waving our credit card to capture our server's attention to pay and leave, which caused us to be late for our subsequent engagement. Despite the good salad bar and drink specials, the experience was soured by the poor quality of the steak and the inattentive service. I'd advise future patrons to consider paying immediately after ordering, especially if you're on a tight schedule.",1

Miso was good, my rainbow roll was standard.Here's where things got weird- I wanted the sashimi platter (which is what I ALWAYS order from sushi restaurants), and kindly requested the substitute the white fish for something else. The platter then comes out with TEN pieces of salmon and two tuna.... I was like wait what??? Why would anyone order a sashimi platter if they wanted a huge plate of salmon with some tuna on the side?! I then kindly requested they replace at least two of the salmon with, say, yellowtail. Nope because MP is higher, yet on the alacarte menu it's the same price. Ok that makes no sense but fine. I ask which specialty rolls I can add cream cheese to... ""none"". Uhhh not true, this isn't my first time eating sushi LOL. I order a rainbow roll and they bring it out with little cubes of cream cheese on each roll. Thanks for trying.My friend ordered the chicken and said it not only looked weird but tasted weird.

3467,"Title: A Chinatown Gem: Wu's Wonton King

Wu's Wonton has been the go-to spot in Chinatown for authentic and delicious dim sum. Their wontons are a standout, perfectly wrapped morsels that never disappoint – a rarity in a sea of easily unraveling counterparts.

Sadly, the doors are temporarily closed due to the pandemic, but reminiscing about my last meal there brings back mouth-watering memories. The Peking duck was succulent, paired with crispy, perfectly fried flounder. A hidden gem on the menu, the snow pea shoot leaves drenched in crab sauce, elevated a simple bowl of rice into a culinary delight.

I recently embarked on a vegan adventure and stumbled upon Just Salad during my quest for quick and satisfying plant-based options. My apprehensions about finding appealing vegan meals were completely quashed by the fantastic experience I had here.

The process of crafting my own salad was seamless, thanks to Ritual. The variety of fresh ingredients at my fingertips was impressive, and I opted for a hearty mix of superblend greens, beets, broccoli, a flavorful black bean corn cilantro blend, and perfectly roasted sweet potatoes. Topping it all off with the lowfat spicy avocado dressing was a stroke of genius - it tied everything together with a creamy kick that was absolutely irresistible.

Just Salad has transformed my view on vegan dining, proving it can be both easy and exceptionally tasty. The salad was not only a delight to my taste buds but also a reassurance that plant-based eating doesn't have to be dull. I'm already excited to return and explore more of their vibrant, fresh offerings.

Kicking things off with the spicy cucumber and pineapple jalapeño drinks, both tantalized the palate, especially the latter with an extra kick of spice. The guacamole, ordered medium spicy, was fantastic though a word of caution: pace yourself to avoid the accumulating heat!

The highlight of the meal had to be the scrumptiously stuffed fish tacos, slightly eclipsing their shrimp counterparts, both of which I'd happily order again. The accompanying corn, rice, and beans each stood out in their own right, with the corn and beans being particularly memorable.

While the sweet platanos weren't exactly to my savory preference, sweet palate enthusiasts would find them irresistible. A nice touch from the staff was not charging us for the tardy platanos – a gesture much appreciated.

What truly sets this restaurant apart is the authentic regional Mexican flair detailed on the menu, which invites diners like myself to explore and discover. I'm already looking forward to my next visit to try something new from this culinary gem.",1
315,"Lola Taverna, a newcomer to the Soho dining scene, offers an authentic Greek experience that somewhat compensates for the lackluster service, which was notably poor even during a quiet Sunday evening. The food mostly hit the mark, with the Saganaki Fondue standing out as a highlight; its delightful blend of flavors sets the bar for what Greek cuisine can be. The Moussaka, while tasty, could reach new heights of decadence with a more generous layer of creamy bechamel and the removal of breadcrumbs that distract from its classic texture. The spread selection offers mixed experiences: the tzatziki and eggplant spreads are flavorful and worth trying, but the fava spread can be passed up. Overall, Lola Taverna nails some of the essentials but has potential for refinement, particularly in service and dish perfection.",1
18937,"A nice restaurant in Ktown that served thick curry sauce on rice, noodles or whatever combination set you choose. Then, you also get to adjust the spicy level. I came just after lunch time 12-3pm and missed the curry noodles with fried shrimp special for $10.99. But I ordered the same thing regardless because I was craving noodles preferably something like udon. The curry noodles was very soft and chewy just like udon and the mild curry was just about right for me with a tint of spicy. The fried shrimp was unlike a shrimp tempura which I was expecting, but it was really good dipped into the curry. The utensils and napkins are in a slidable drawer right under the table which is very organized. The server was friendly and I was in and out of the restaurant pretty quickly. My total was about $15 and I say it was a well worth it lunch!",0
17354,"I had the pleasure of dining at this charming establishment with a rustic decor that immediately set a welcoming tone, complimented by the friendly staff. The meal began on a high note with a generously sized carafe of mimosa that was both refreshing and delightful. Unfortunately, the starter of prosciutto and melon did not meet expectations, as the fruit lacked freshness. However, the culinary experience significantly improved with the arrival of the main courses. The eggs Benedict was expertly prepared, offering a delightful balance of flavors. Additionally, the penne with ragu was a highlight, featuring a rich and savory sauce that paired beautifully with the perfectly cooked pasta. Overall, despite the initial hiccup with the starter, the meal was enjoyable and the restaurant's ambiance and service made for a pleasant dining experience.",1
16941,"There are clearly some competing opinions about Menkui-Tei, but this is one of my favorite  lunch spots.  Because of that, I don't have exposure to the wider dinner menu, but other than a couple of yakitori skewers, I doubt my orders would be much different, or that I'd come away less satisfied.For starters, when I come in here, it's usually full of actual Japanese people, and I consider that a good sign.  They appear to be happy, and while they don't tend to linger, I imagine that's because they're on break.I linger happily, and find that a 32 oz. mug of beer is about perfect to get me from start to finish.  While the beer menu is limited, and drafts even more so, there are also a decent number of sakes on offer. Lunch usually starts by splitting an order of gyoza with my partner, and while I've never really felt that much separates the good from the mediocre in this particular dumpling, I really enjoy these, and how especially crispy they are on the bottom.  The filling is tasty enough that the sauce seems extraneous to me.My order is always the same: Tantan Men, built around a spicy sesame broth, with two poached eggs and a spicy bomb on the side. I only use about two thirds of the latter, which seems perfect to me to create an extremely piquant broth without overshadowing the ingredients.  I have gleaned that some noodles are thicker than others between the various styles of ramen, though no choice is given; the ones in the Tantan are slightly thicker than others, and have a wonderful bite to them.  The ground pork within the bowl is very generous, though I cannot say that for the vegetables.  I would like a bit more scallion, perhaps, but bok choy doesn't really take on flavor or add much here other than color.  Altogether, prepared as above, this is a blazing hot dish that I cannot stop eating, nor do I want to.  I'm sad when it's gone, and even being stuffed at the end, could probably force down another.My dining partner typically orders the Stamina bowl, a spicy miso base with pork belly, with adding sprouts and also two poached eggs. I have to point out that the poached eggs here are absolutely perfect and consistent, at least in my experience.  The noodles here are thinner, and while I have sampled it a few times, it's a milder flavor than I prefer.  Described as spicy on the menu, that isn't a word I would use, and it would definitely benefit from the remaining third of my spicy bomb.We also usually split either a small curry rice or nikumiso-don,  both of which are phenomenal, providing a brief respite from the fire breathing monster in my bowl.  Either round out the meal very nicely, and add a note that a bowl of soup alone would lack.I'll be back next week, and probably the week after that.  I will also recommend it very highly; I see folks complaining about their take out orders, but this isn't the kind of food that travels well, and people should know better.  Eaten hot and fresh, I've never found the food at Menkui-Tei to be anything less than totemo oishī desu.",0
13328,"Title: A Delightful Italian Feast Fit for a ‘Stud’

I recently dined at an inviting Italian eatery that boasted perfectly suitable cuisine at a moderate price point. The occasion was the birthday celebration of my friend - playfully dubbed an 'Italian Stud' for his heritage - and our party of ten was comfortably accommodated thanks to a necessary reservation.

The ambiance beckoned us to start with two cold antipasti platters, artfully presented on wooden palettes with portions ample for our robust group. The restaurant was considerate in offering complimentary fresh bread with olive oil and a small tomato-based soup to whet our appetites.

Unfortunately, the establishment was out of the specific Italian red wine we hoped to try, but a Californian red served as a decent substitute and was reasonably priced. As our varied entrees arrived, the birthday boy relished his steak and pasta combo, save for an ornamental orchid which he passed on (though, confirmed edible, I playfully took a bite to prove the point).

My lobster ravioli with shrimp impressed, requiring just a dash of fresh pepper and grated parmesan to elevate its mild but pleasing pink sauce. To conclude, the birthday boy’s tiramisu was met with satisfaction, while my Fresh Lemon Mint sorbet was a refreshing finale, dotted with real mint and zesty lemon.

The staff's pleasant and accommodating service ensured a lovely dining experience, ready to assist and answer questions. A recommendation stands for this establishment, with a heads-up to future diners: reservations are wise, no matter the size of your party.",1
10753,"Title: A Heavenly Pasta Paradise in the Heart of NYC

From the moment you set eyes on the charming facade of this gem, there's a sense that you're in for a treat. The staff, as pleasing to the eye as the storefront, welcomes you with an air of professionalism and warmth.

As you step inside, the ambience strikes a perfect balance between cozy and sophisticated, setting the stage for a culinary experience that doesn't disappoint. The homemade pastas, the stars of the show, are nothing short of divine. With flavors that are well-balanced and never too rich, each dish delights the palate without overwhelming it.

Even during lunch, the portions are generous, allowing for an ideal sharing experience. Our table reveled in the fettuccine tartufo, savored the authentic spaghetti carbonara, and indulged in the creamy risotto funghi—each entree a testament to the kitchen's prowess.

If you find yourself in NYC, do not miss the opportunity to dine here. We're already planning our return visit for another taste of heaven.",1
15496,"Title: Fantastic Friday Night at the Eatery!

My colleagues and I landed at this gem last Friday night, and it was my inaugural visit. I must say, the experience was nothing short of awesome. The drink selection here is remarkable. We indulged in their signature rainbow shots - a spectacle of 19 different concoctions that truly captured the essence of their diverse menu.

As for the food, it was a delightful accompaniment to our libations. The honey garlic chicken wings were sticky and sweet, the sliders juicy and satisfying. The mac and cheese wedges were a decadent treat, while the yucca and waffle fries were perfect for sharing—and we shared aplenty, along with about a dozen crisp Coronas to round off our feast.

I was particularly impressed by the attentive service; the waitresses were on the ball, ensuring our evening was smooth and enjoyable. This place definitely earned a spot on my go-to list for a fun night out. Will be back for sure!",1
14137,"From the moment the warm chips hit our table, I knew we'd made the right choice. The fresh guacamole was a perfect partner – creamy, flavorful, and clearly made with care. Both the beef tacos and the chicken enchilada didn't disappoint, flaunting an authenticity that's hard to find. To wash it all down, the margaritas were on point: strong, but not overpowering, with just the right blend of sweetness and zest. Service was as excellent as the food, attentive without being overbearing. I'm already looking forward to our next visit.",1
20659,"Title: Tasty Vegan Options with Some Quirks

If you find yourself at this eatery, the guac burger is a must-try. As a non-vegan, I was skeptical, but this burger did not disappoint – flavorful and satisfying. However, steer clear of the sweet potato fries if you prefer them crispy; mine arrived a tad too soggy. 

The condiment selection was unexpected, offering more than the standard ketchup I anticipated. The red beet condiment was the standout for sure, adding a unique twist to the meal. But beware if you're not a fan of mayonnaise – the yellow condiment may not be to your taste as it reminded me of a spicy version of the condiment I personally dislike.

Seating can be a bit cramped, especially at the small circular tables, which hardly contain the messiness of a loaded burger. It's a charming spot, but the limited space and the overflow of guac might turn a tidy meal into a bit of a challenge.

In conclusion, while the food is enjoyable and worth trying, I wouldn't make it a daily haunt, especially for those who aren't strictly vegan. For a more regular burger fix, I'd probably head to Shake Shack. And a heads-up for those who carry cash – this place is strictly card only.",1
1737,"I recently had an exceptional dining experience at a local Thai restaurant that truly stood out. The spicy fish fillet was a culinary masterpiece, striking a perfect balance between sweet and spicy flavors. Additionally, the pad Thai was delightful. When I opted for takeout, I was impressed with the generous portion sizes they provided.

As a registered nurse, I'm touched by their thoughtful gesture of preparing meals for healthcare workers. This act of kindness, layered on top of a delicious meal, makes this restaurant a place I highly recommend for anyone craving authentic Thai cuisine.",1
18365,"Title: A Letdown at a Sichuan Eatery

I entered with high expectations for a hearty Sichuan lunch, but my experience fell short of the mark. The restaurant's lunch specials, from Mapo tofu to sweet & sour soup and dandan noodles, suffered from an overuse of Sichuan peppercorn, which, rather than adding the usual zesty kick, imparted an unsettling numbness, particularly in the soup. This was a stark contrast to my usual encounters with the vibrant tastes of Sichuan cuisine.

A lone bright spot in the meal was the fish fillet dish, which was well-seasoned and flavorful without being overpowered by heat. The balanced notes of scallion, ginger, and soy sauce were enjoyable.

Service-wise, the restaurant did not falter, providing an adequate level of attention without being remarkable. Sadly, even decent service cannot fully redeem a meal when the main actors – the dishes – fail to delight the palate.",1
16948,"Title: A Memorable Meal Amidst the Festivities

My visit to New Wonjo Restaurant last Saturday coincided with the vibrant 2019 NYC Korean Parade and Koreatown Street Festival, making the place buzz with energy. Despite the crowd, it only took ten minutes for our waitress to attend to us, a minor delay given the hustle. Once she arrived, her politeness and attentiveness were commendable throughout the meal.

Opting for the lunch special, my wife and I were treated to a delightfully flavorful Galbi and a Spicy Soft Tofu Stew that lived up to its ""less spicy"" billing, arriving steaming hot and perfectly seasoned. The galbi's flawless cook had our taste buds dancing in joy.

Though initially kept waiting, the overall experience was truly memorable. Between the sumptuous food, welcoming vibes, and excellent company, New Wonjo proved to be a shining gem in the heart of the festivities. Would recommend for anyone craving authentic Korean cuisine.",1

Even the little details like smoking the salmon, chia jello and sun dried tomatoes made the omakase experience so unique! I was in heaven. The chef did mention that the courses may differ with each omakase experience.I highly recommend sitting at the sushi bar because you learn so much from the sushi chef.

On the cashier's advice, I opted for the basil chicken, which arrived promptly and in a generous portion. Unfortunately, the dish didn't live up to expectations. The chicken was overcooked and excessively salty, overshadowing the flavors one would anticipate in a basil-infused dish. Accompanied by a fried egg and steamed rice, both of which were on the drier side, the meal left much to be desired. Despite the quick service and fair pricing, the lackluster experience has convinced me that there are superior lunch options available in the vicinity. I'm not inclined to return.",1

16576,"Title: Sophisticated Thai Dining in Manhattan with a Few Hiccups

I recently visited a posh Thai restaurant in Manhattan with a friend, lured by the promise of an elegant dining experience. Booking our spot through Yelp was a breeze – a text alert system kept us posted on our wait time, which was a tolerable 35-45 minutes. We even received a considerate call right before our table was ready.

Upon arrival, the service was impeccable: quick seating, prompt delivery of menus and water, and continuous check-ins to ensure our comfort. The restaurant's chic decor lived up to Manhattan's swanky standards, and the menu was an abundant testament to Thai cuisine. Observing the parade of dishes, I was optimistic about what was to come.

I chose the Royal Pad Thai, while my friend opted for the five-spice duck. The dishes arrived looking like edible art – the presentation unmatched in my experience with Thai food. However, taste-wise, it didn't quite surpass the flavors I've savored on the west coast. My disappointment peaked when I found the prawns in my Pad Thai parched rather than plump and juicy.

In the context of Manhattan, the prices were expected, though lunch options seemed more wallet-friendly. While the ambiance and service were both unquestionable five-star experiences, the food, despite its visual triumph, left something to be desired, earning a modest three stars.

14690,"Title: A Lively Evening at a Buzz-worthy Eatery

After much anticipation, I visited this local hotspot with a friend for a Thursday dinner and, to our delight, were seated immediately at 8 pm. The open kitchen added a lively touch, allowing us to observe our meals in the making – a unique form of culinary entertainment. Be warned, though; the compact space amplified the bustling atmosphere, making it a challenging venue for those who prefer a quieter dining experience.

The food was nothing short of remarkable. The pork belly adobo was a standout dish (5/5) – succulent slices bathed in a savory soy and vinegar concoction, which I'd eagerly order again. Equally impressive was the sizzling sisig (5/5), shattering my previous mayo-laden experience with its crisply cooked pork and a spicy kick that lingered pleasantly on the palate. 

The mantao buns (4/5) were a satisfying salty interlude between the richness of our main courses, arriving in a modest serving of four or five. Dessert came in the form of halo-halo (4/5), a new venture for my taste buds. It struck a commendable balance of flavors without an overpowering sweetness – a refreshing finale to our meal.

Overall, this eatery is a strong contender for group dinners or casual dates. I would not only return but also recommend this gem to those seeking a dynamic dining experience paired with delectable cuisine.",1

I got the croque monsieur and a side of pancake.  We were the only people in the restaurant around 12pm and were seated immediately.  The food  was delicious and service was good too.

11185,"Title: A Feast to Remember at a Steal of a Price

I recently indulged in the Restaurant Month promotion at this carnivore's paradise for a mere $39 per person, and what a delectable deal it was! Snagging a 6:45pm reservation on the final Friday, my expectations were high, having previously enjoyed the offerings of their Philadelphia location.

Commendations to the staff for their flexibility; we were given the choice of adding dessert post-meal, which we graciously declined due to the ample portion sizes - though the option to take it to-go was a thoughtful touch.

The unlimited meats and salad bar left us more than satiated - an evening well-spent. The Market Table was a highlight with its smorgasbord of options, from smoked salmon to fresh mozzarella dishes. The hearty accompaniments, including irresistible warm cheese breads and savory rice & beans, made for a delightful prelude to the meaty main event.

The caramelized bacon simply stole the show. Its divine blend of sweet and savory had us savoring each bite, and for a moment, it felt like the pinnacle of bacon evolution - a harmonious fusion of jerky and kettle corn.

However, not all that glitters is gold. The continuous tableside service of fire-roasted meats fell short of my anticipation, with most cuts being excessively salted, except for the pork ribs. Despite the well-executed texture and cooking temperature, the overseasoning was a letdown.

Our servers were the night's unsung heroes - friendly, accommodating, and ever-attentive. In all honesty, at the regular price of $68, the experience might not have held the same charm. But during Restaurant Month? It's an occurrence not to miss, especially for that exceptional bacon.",1
14124,"Phenomenal!After searching for eateries in the general area, I came upon this place based off reviews, the menu, and comfortable seating (meaning it's not a typical Manhattan restaurant where everyone is on top of each other). I do not regret choosing this place.I made a reservation and once we got in, were seated right away.  Everyone from the front to the waitress to the manager making rounds asking us how we were to the guy filling up the waters were simply outstanding all across the board. I mean, there is friendly service and then there's here. A lot of places need to learn from this location. We opted for the booth on the floor level, but next time we'll try upstairs with the ""view"". The place overall is comfortable and clean - the decor is great and welcoming. The menu is simple, but offers enough variety. It's called ""Ocean Prime"", so while seafood is the main event here, there are options like steak/filet mignon as well. The wine/cocktail list is pretty varied as well.We both ordered the lobster bisque. I've never had a better lobster bisque anywhere. They even came with the bowl showing the lobster inside before pouring the bisque. I would come here just for the bisque. It was that good. I tell you, if you enjoy lobster bisque, try this one - you won't regret it. I ordered the two lobster tails, which were excellent. My companion ordered the scallops with risotto (I had a taste - excellent). The portions were enough and satisfying - and cooked perfectly. The desserts were also outstanding. The cheesecake was perfect and the creme brulee was superb. Definitely recommended to all and of course I will be coming back for sure.",0
20861,"While I never made it to Great Jones Cafe, I gather it's hard act to follow. I can't speak to how the Jones compares, but I can speak to what it does well, which is just about everything. While miniature in stature, the Jones is yet another shining example of how adept Gabe Stulman is at creating the quintessential all-day eatery. It's casual, incredibly cozy and oozing with character. I'm always impressed with the ambiance at Stulman's restaurants -- it's clear that a lot of care and consideration go into the planning of how to construct a spot that feels alive and engaging. And to be expected, the food is fantastic as well, backed up with a funky and adventurous wine menu full of natural/biodynamic options. You'll find fresh ingredients with an emphasis on seafood and veggies, approachable dishes with a subtle whiff of sophistication. And the last Stulman hallmark: impeccable service. Everyone working here appears to delight in doing so and the hospitality truly is the best in the business. While you might need to wait a while to snag a seat (reservations are hard to come by in such a tiny space), The Jones is worth your time. We came here, well, uh, twice in one night. I'll explain: the website maintains that there are seats here saved for walk-ins. So while we couldn't get a reservation on Resy, we figured we'd show up and try our luck. We got here at around 8pm, where we got hit with a 90-minute wait. At the time, it seemed long. We left swiftly, opting for a nearby spot which also claims to hold space for walk-ins. This one hit us with a whopping FOUR HOUR wait (""we are fully committed tonight"", famous last words), so we scurried back to the Jones and begged for a second chance. The host (delightful staff member #1) told us to take a seat on the couch, grab a drink and he'd try to work something out at the bar. At this point it was closer to 9, so we hoped that what started as a 90-minute wait would be knocked down to 30. To our excitement -- and this is seemingly a rarity in this scene -- we were shepherded to the bar around 9:30 and that was that. Delightful staff members #2 and #3 both helped us out with our drink orders as we lounged on the couch. I love and appreciate said couch, because it allows a few small parties to wait for tables without being forced to stand by the bar in an already-cramped space. While we did feel like ""official"" patrons yet, we felt welcomed and embraced and that's just a really yummy feeling. We ordered a round of drinks, which is just as big of a draw here as the food. Wine is the main event --the Jones has a short list of cocktails, but those too are mostly are wine-based. I started with the Vermutado (Two Sherries, Vermut Negre, Tonic), which was nice and refreshing but not that exciting. Get wine!Once we were seated at the bar, we met delightful staff member #4, the bartender and a Very Knowledgable Gentleman. Once we put in our food order, he helped us in choosing some wines, which was a huge help. I ordered the Microbio ""Correcaminos"" from Spain, which was really funky/complex/unusual and exactly what I was looking for. The bf and I were going to split a glass when our final plates showed up and inquired about one specific glass, but the bartender suggested one of the skin contact wines instead, as he figured it would pair best with our food. The wine was delicious, and he was very much not wrong. A real pleasure indeed.Food-wise, we sampled a decent amount of the menu, as the portion sizes are fairly small (and the dishes, fairly light) in the apps section. It took some time to deliberate (a common occurrence, one known to irritate) but the bartender was as patient as they come and helped steer us in a good direction. Eats, below:Maine Uni w/ lemon jam and crackers: A-Not the best uni I've ever had but still tasty and packs a punch. Liked the flavor profile with the lemon jam, enjoyed the balance with the citrus.Ricotta w/ delicata squash: A+Our bartender said this was the star and he sure was right. Not sure if the ricotta or squash was better, but both were outstanding. Uber flavorful and fresh, was pining for more squash.Gem Lettuce w/ manchego and almonds: B+/A-Nothing special but still light and yummy. Not sure if this is the norm, but we had maybe a tiny handful of slivered almonds, I wouldn't even think to mention them in the description.Beets w/ labneh, sumac, watercress: AAgain, roots veggies and dairy are a winning combination. I adore beets and sitting atop the fluffy labneh, just dreamy. Sweet, rich, nice spice added from the sumac.Snapper Crudo w/ cucumber and aleppo pepper: AA straightforward crudo. Fresh and satisfying, another very light dish. I enjoyed the cucumber relish atop the fish, made for a lovely presentation and added some mild flavorRosette de Lyon w/ pecorino toscano: AThinly-sliced sausage, perfect pairing with the pecorino. Recommended as the highlight of the charcuterie options and didn't disappoint.",0
11618,"With an 8 p.m. curtain call and my friend arriving at 7 p.m. (thanks MTA), our choices for dinner was going to be either Junior's or Il Forno. Having eaten here a few years ago (pasta), I suggested Il Forno.The ambiance was adorable (resembling a quaint Italian street) and I expected a good dining experience. Wrong While the waitress was attentive at first in terms of service, it dwindled as we were halfway into our meal. We emphasized that we had tickets to a play and needed to be quick. We ordered a Pinot Noir to start things off. It was smooth and delicious but they do not offer happy hour. For main, we decided to order two pizzette varieties so that we could share. When I visited a few years back, I ordered pasta and remembered enjoying it. I never tried their ""pizza"".The pizzette was oval and cut into 8 pieces.We selected the  artichoke with 4 cheese and the garden vegetable with ricotta. At first, when it was served, it looked amazing. Keep in mind, it is more like a flatbread or a cracker like crust with toppings. Not even remotely close to being a pizza. The artichoke with 4 cheese included a sprinkle of diced canned artichoke while the cheese topping was oily and thick. The cheese tasted like it was the  processed variety. Also, quite salty.The garden vegetable was equally disappointing--sprinkle of some greens, grape tomatoes, cheese and a dollop of ricotta cheese. The 4 cheese pizzette style's cheese began to get stiff as it got colder. Overall, a mess. If you must dine here, stay away from the pizzette. I was disappointed in general and will stay away for good long while. The only positive was that we were out by 7:55 p.m. and made the curtain call.Should have gone with Junior's.",0

They were out of hibiscus tea when I went, so I just got a green tea. It's a little expensive at $3, but I guess you're paying more for ambiance and those french vibes.

12663,"Title: A Delectable Feast at a Local Kabob Hotspot

I've always had a penchant for kabob joints, my curiosity piqued by the frequent sight of people clutching large containers of aromatic takeout in my building's elevator. Today, I finally succumbed to my cravings and decided to give this place a shot – I was not disappointed.

The menu offers a customizable eating experience, where patrons can choose from a selection of proteins. I opted for the succulent chicken, noting that prices for chicken and beef were on par, with a slight upcharge for premium options like lamb. To accompany my choice, I selected fragrant saffron rice and a duo of vegetables – the brussels sprouts and broccoli, both of which were fresh and flavorful.

Accompanying my main were a crisp salad and a trio of spreads from six tantalizing options, a delight for anyone who enjoys mixing and matching their flavors. The meal was perfectly rounded off with a piece of fresh bread, making for a hearty, satisfying plate.

Admittedly, the $13 price tag might seem steep at a glance, but the size and quality of the portion left no room for regrets. The chicken was notably well-cooked, juicy and far from the dreaded dryness that can often plague poultry dishes. 

The promise of this establishment is clear from the first visit, buoyed by the helpful and attentive staff. While it's not an everyday dining spot for me budget-wise, the allure of the flavors means I'll be making a weekly pilgrimage. Without hesitation, I recommend this spot to fellow kabob aficionados seeking a commendable meal experience.",1

I recently visited ""The Bar Downstairs"" for a post-work gathering and was once again impressed by the venue. This is not your average watering hole; it's perfect for a higher-end happy hour experience. We were a sizable group of 15, and the setting, with its modern decor and warm lighting paired with the high ceilings and exposed ductwork, created a welcoming industrial-chic atmosphere. The open kitchen and central bar layout add to the illusion of space in what is essentially a single large room.

Despite the post-work crowd flooding in at 6 pm, the cleverly arranged seating allowed our conversations to flow without strain. Their cocktail menu, boasting over 30 signature and classic options, caters to diverse palates, while the extensive selection of spirits and wines is sure to please connoisseurs.

The appetizers, from the grilled shishito peppers to the succulent scallops, were impeccable. Service was top-notch, with staff that were both courteous and attentive. Be prepared for a pricier bill, but the quality of the food, drinks, and atmosphere make it a worthwhile splurge for those special after-work occasions.",1
1203,"we loved this place! bucatini all'amatriciana is my favorite pasta dish of all time and at L'Artusi it's even better than i've had in Italy! it's got the perfect kick of heat, and is nice and saucy. for starters the beef carpaccio is excellent, but i would skip the butter lettuce salad, it's bland and rather tough. my bf got the lamb ragu pici, and he liked it a lot, however i didn't care for it that much as it tasted too heavy and rich.we got the rocky road sundae for dessert and it's amazing. it's made with homemade toasted marshmallow gelato and hot fudge. i would go back just for the sundae alone, get an espresso with it to cut the sweetness and it's the perfect end to a meal. we had a reservation at 8pm on a saturday, and it was a headache to get, you have to be on open table 28 days ahead of the day you want to go and refresh exactly at midnight. in minutes everything will be booked up. service was super friendly and the sweet hostess was kind enough to give us a great half booth downstairs.",0
12089,"This exceeded my expectations. The crispy chicken bowl with absolutely delicious, filling and a good portion. I left extremely stuffed because I refused to stop eating, though I definitely could have had leftovers. I recommend coming here for the hospitality and good food. They've only been open since July so go check it out! Also they will sweeten your ice tea with pineapple chunks, which is just too good.",0
13521,"Title: Delightful Dumplings and More at Cozy Spot

I recently visited this restaurant in search of some delectable dumplings and my experience certainly hit the mark. The seating wait time was incredibly brief, and we promptly found ourselves at a welcoming table.

The menu boasted an impressive array of dumpling and dim sum selections. I opted for the hot and spicy wontons alongside the fried pork dumplings—a personal favorite. Meanwhile, my boyfriend chose the spicy beef soup paired with steamed chicken dumplings.

The spicy wontons were a standout, swimming in a bowl of sweet spicy oil that added a delightful kick. The fried pork dumplings, while basic, satisfied my craving perfectly. On the other hand, my boyfriend's soup was noted for its refreshing and natural taste, indicative of the freshness of the ingredients.

Pleasingly, the food was hearty without being overfilling, and the prices were reasonable. The restaurant itself radiated a pleasant atmosphere, complemented by spotless restrooms. The staff's friendly engagement with regular customers only added to the charm of the place.

In conclusion, this restaurant delivered on flavor, atmosphere, and value. Without a doubt, I'm looking forward to returning.",1
3108,"Upon dining at this establishment, it was immediately apparent that the cuisine is indeed the highlight. The pork dishes are exceptionally savory, with the Chairman Bao deserving a special recommendation for its flavorful punch. My companion's fried chicken also garnered high praise, and we both appreciated the swift service delivered by a convivial staff.

However, the dining experience was marred by an auditory onslaught; the music selection was, simply put, abysmal. Patrons with sensitive ears or those accompanied by children might find the atmosphere unsuitable. While the food is worth the visit, I often find myself making it a brief one to avoid the acoustic discomfort.",1
19949,"Title: A Hidden Gem for Indian Cuisine

I stumbled upon this charming Indian restaurant at lunchtime and was immediately taken by its quaint and cozy ambiance. The dim lighting contributed to the homey feel, making for a welcoming retreat. Opting for the chicken lunch special, I was presented with a tray brimming with diverse and delicious offerings. Each bite was a testament to authentic flavors and quality ingredients. The service was swift, which may have been aided by the fact that I was dining solo at the time. For those seeking a quality Indian meal in the area, this spot is definitely worth a visit.",1
2039,"A very high-end hot pot place. I have never had wagyu beef inside of hot pot and it tasted very good. There was also table side grill but we didn't order that. Instead, we had Pecking duck, which reminded me the one that I had in Beijing. My only complaint was the lamb was very chewy.",0
17193,"Food: 5/5My friends call me ""dumpling"" for a reason. For the past few years, I've been eating a lot of dumplings. Vanessa's Dumpling is the Mecca of dumplings but specifically this location takes the cake. Eldridge is the original location. I remember this spot when it was half the size.Their pork and chive fried dumplings are a mouth watering experience. Four dumplings for $2 makes it the perfect snack. It's perfectly crispy on the bottom and the skin is the perfect texture/thickness. It used to be $1.25 for four dumplings baaack in the days. You can even buy a huge bag of frozen dumplings and bring it home. Their boiled dumplings are delicious too but.. I always prefer fried. Fried food is always better. Vanessa's Dumpling on Eldridge is definitely worth a try if you're in the area!Service: 1/5This place gets packed and the staff members get pretty busy. It's self serve in here. I always say please and thank you but the staff members don't reciprocate. Zero smiles. Not very friendly.Ambiance: 3/5This place was half the size and gross but upon expansion, the place got cleaner and more presentable.

14350,"After many visits post-work, I've grown quite fond of this Chinese gem. Whether I'm indulging in their savory chicken wings with perfectly crispy fries, the vibrant flavors of the vegetable lo mein, or the delectably sweet and tangy sesame chicken, the food consistently satisfies my cravings. The staff, particularly the lovely lady at the counter, always greets me with a smile, enhancing the dining experience with their warmth. Their generous hospitality, often gifting a complimentary soda or egg rolls with my order, is a testament to their customer care. It's undoubtedly one of the top Chinese spots in the area, providing a delightful closure to any bustling workday.",1
19730,"Title: Hits and Misses at a Cool Vibe Spot

I had high hopes for an enjoyable dining experience with my family and, initially, things seemed promising. We were seated on time in this unique restaurant that cleverly pairs its entrance with a guitar shop, setting a cool and creative tone.

Eager to start our meal with a celebratory touch, I ordered a pricey bottle of champagne, which, unfortunately, turned into an exercise of patience. The delay and subsequent explanation that only the manager could retrieve it dampened the mood. Even after it arrived, the lack of attentive service persisted, as we were left to refill our own glasses without further check-ins.

On a brighter note, the food was a mix of hits and misses, with the Peruvian chicken standing out as a highlight and the steak tacos falling short of expectations. Their mac 'n' cheese also scored points on our table.

Regrettably, the initial server became a ghost, and the manager's fleeting presence was solely for business formalities. While the cuisine earned a solid 4-star rating, the service was a letdown, barely scraping together 2 stars.",1
20960,"Title: A Tale of Two Delicacies: Skewers and Boil Pots

My recent excursion to a gem of a restaurant presented a delightful dilemma: choosing between their exquisite boil pots and sensational skewers. Both options deserve a resounding 5-star rating.

The skewers burst with a myriad of flavors. Standout selections included the lamb and pig feet—the latter almost mirroring the authentic taste savored in China, with an agreeable balance of crispiness without feeling overly fatty. The mantou, with its cracker-like texture, proved to be a perfectly crispy companion.

Conversely, certain skewers like the beef tendon, scallops, and beef back fell short of remarkable, overshadowed by more tantalizing choices.

The spicy and numbing boil pot, packed with shrimp and blue crab, delivered a tingling sensation so intense it could numb the legs! While the crab proved challenging to tackle, the shrimp was a delight, soaking up the pot's spicy sweetness to perfection.

Eagerly anticipating a return visit, I might just tilt the scales in favor of those delectable skewers next time.",1
2547,"I recently had the pleasure of visiting a local eatery where I was pleasantly surprised by their culinary offerings. The standout dish for me was undoubtedly the meat pie. It’s an absolute must-get, overshadowing the more hyped dumplings. Don’t get me wrong, the dumplings weren’t bad, but they paled in comparison to the meat pie’s delightful flavors. Another item that caught my attention was the pork pancake. It was generously filled with a succulent piece of pork that was both juicy and brimming with rich taste. Even as I write this review, I find myself longing for another bite of that indulgent pancake. Do yourself a favor and give these dishes a try; you won’t regret it!",1

13210,"Just okay. The chunks of lobster were fresh and tasty but the rolls are really small and we couldn't distinguish between the plain version and the truffle butter version. I mean, if you put truffle butter on something, I should be able to tell. Slaw was a good accompaniment, if a bit too vinegary. Sodas are really unique and I loved them - and I am not a soda drinker at all. Service was super friendly. Prices were high for the amount of food, but that's what you get in NYC. I mean, in a way, I was actually happy not to be super stuffed - but I do think they were overpriced.Glad to have tried it (first lobster roll!), but I will have to have a better one some other time, like when we visit New England.",0
18396,"Title: A Mixed Experience at [Restaurant Name]

I visited [Restaurant Name] on a quiet Tuesday evening with high expectations for a leisurely meal. On the upside, the spicy rigatoni was a standout—every dish we tried was delectable and certainly left me wanting to return for more of their culinary delights.

Unfortunately, our enjoyment was dampened by the overly assertive service. The staff, albeit probably well-intentioned, made us feel hurried throughout our dinner, frequently checking to see if they could clear our plates long before we were finished. This eagerness to turn over the table seemed misplaced, as the restaurant was far from bustling with no patrons waiting for a seat.

Despite the pushy service, the quality of the food makes me optimistic about giving [Restaurant Name] another try. I'm hopeful that on my next visit, the pace will be more relaxed, allowing the flavors and experience to be savored to the fullest.",1
2872,"This was my second trip to Mimi's so I knew what to expect. Absolutely delicious dumplings. Once I read that July's special was the ever popular Emmy burger dumpling, I knew I was going to go back, price be damned! Yes, only a couple of blocks away are all the authentic dumpling places that you can get a good amount of food for almost next to nothing, but those places don't make Emmy dumplings. I'll have those the rest of the year. The custom sauce that comes with it...so good. A friend was with me, and she wasn't interested in trying any dumplings. I was glad because I wanted them all to myself, but I decided to be gracious and offer her one. After one bite, she loved them. Sadly for me, that meant I had to part with 2 more lol. She talked about the dumplings the rest of our trip. It's that good. Price is too high, but we still go back, so that's that.",0

The star of the show, the ramen, impressed with its savory broth and perfectly cooked noodles. I indulged in the shoyu ramen, and the robust, chunky broth truly hit the spot. My dining companion's miso ramen received high praise as well. Their drink menu is not to be overlooked, offering a nice variety to accompany your meal. I'm already planning my next visit to have a go at their spicy curry ramen. This place is a must-try for ramen lovers, and I'm eagerly looking forward to my return.",1
12007,Not so sure why this place has so much hype. The service was definitely very good but the food was just ok. We went for dinner on a Saturday night and the restaurant was pretty empty. They give you good antipasto and bread to start. The pastas weren't freshly made and the sauce was just ok. The giant pepper grinder was very extra and gave only a few peppers!! Lol,0
20412,Pretty solid korean place! I feel that their dishes are a little more traditional than other ktown places (ie less fusion-y)They make their own tofu so they serve you a little bowl of it as a side dish!We jad:- bulgogi jeongol (stew): it was a little sweeter than i would have preferred but there was an adequate amount of meat and veggies in there. I would estimate about a 2 real person serving size (ie would feed two people comfortably if you didnt get any other dish)- spicy pork with kimchi and tofu (): could be a little spicier and im used to more sour kimchi in this dishI dont know which of these came with it but we also got a pot of stone rice!,0
10966,"Title: A Satisfying Escape Next to Yakitori Totto

Deciding to forgo the lengthy queue at Yakitori Totto turned out to be a wise decision as we stumbled into a delightful spot nearby, where seating was readily available on a weekday evening. The culinary journey began on a high note with the sashimi appetizer; its freshness and tender, clean taste set the stage for the meal to come. The shrimp tempura's crunch was a perfect contrast, while the Chicken Katsu curry offered a comforting, hearty option.

An innovative approach to dining here is the shared noodle bowl concept; ordering a bowl of noodles with a side like tempura or curry to split allows for a varied tasting experience. The noodles, particularly the cold soba, stood out with their exceptional texture. However, if warmth is what you're after, the hot soba accompanied by a rich fish-based broth will surely hit the spot.

Dessert was another highlight, with the black sesame and green tea ice creams leaving a lasting impression, especially the latter with its robust, authentic flavor, enhanced by the addition of red beans. The flexible serving sizes for the soba dishes are commendable, ensuring that your level of hunger is perfectly catered to.

In summary, this restaurant has secured its place on my go-to list for those noodle cravings. Its generous portions, reasonable prices, and delectable dishes make it a must-return destination.",1
15297,"Title: Cozy Comfort with a Gluten-Free Twist

My friend and I ventured into this bustling eatery for a Friday night dinner, grateful for our 6:30 reservation, as the place was teeming with diners. Embracing dietary preferences, I chose the gluten-free options, starting with the biscuits. While slightly dense, they satisfied my craving. My friend's regular biscuits, in contrast, were the epitome of light and fluffy.

The star of the evening was the gluten-free sweet tea brined fried chicken — a crispy, made-to-order delight that had us both singing its praises. However, the buckwheat waffles that followed didn't hit the mark; we found them lacking in crunch and were puzzled by the cheese pairing.

Ambiance-wise, the restaurant charmed with its quaint and cozy interior. Service was a high point, with attentive and knowledgeable servers who guided us through the menu with commendable recommendations.

In summary, a fun spot for those seeking a comfortable atmosphere and a menu considerate of gluten-free needs, with just a minor misstep on the waffle front.",1
20802,"Title: A Quiet Spot for Brunch

I recently visited this restaurant for a Saturday brunch with a friend and wanted to share my experience. The venue offers a good selection of brunch options. I opted for the tuna tartare, while my friend enjoyed the escargot. To our surprise, the place was almost empty between 11 am and noon, which suggests it's not a brunch hotspot in the area.

We ended up here after finding the adjacent restaurant too crowded, but the quiet atmosphere here was conducive to conversation. A word of caution for those with hearty appetites: the brunch portions aren't particularly large. While the food quality was good, prices were on the higher side. Overall, a decent choice if you're looking for a peaceful brunch with quality food.",1

16750,"A friend of mine told me about Thursday Kitchen and I'm so glad she did!  We stopped in on a Monday night and were treated to some amazing Korean fusion tapas paired with great ambiance and flawless service.We ordered 4 plates: Cauliflower, Mac and Cheese, Lamb Meatballs, and Spicy Chicken and both my boyfriend and I loved each dish. This was also the perfect amount of food for 2 people- we left feeling full but without that gross overeating feeling.Our server let us know which dishes might have a kick to them, but we didn't find any of them to be that spicy (maybe we were warned because we're they type of people who look like they'd call salt spicy....)  The staff continuously filled our drinks and each dish came out promptly. Overall, everyone from the host to the kitchen staff was friendly and we were seated well before our estimated 25 minute wait.I'd suggest coming to this restaurant with a small group so you're able to try and taste more menu items! That being said, I felt like this was a perfect date night spot and I can't wait to come back again soon.",0
14447,"Title: A Mixed Bag for a Birthday Lunch

I recently visited this establishment with a group of eight friends for a birthday celebration. The majority of us decided to try the uni bibimbap lunch set. I was instantly captivated by the presentation of the dish, notably the crunchy quinoa, which stood out as the star of the meal for me. However, the uni itself was just passable.

I found the abundance of pickled items overwhelming and not to my personal liking, as they tend to be high in sodium and less nutritious. Additionally, the steamed egg custard was disappointing, having a porous texture that suggested it had been steamed for too long, a stark contrast to the superior homemade versions I've experienced.

It's important to note that this review focuses solely on the culinary aspects and does not take into account the ambiance or service, which were commendable. The restaurant boasts a beautifully rustic and upscale interior, and our waiter excelled at managing our large party. Overall, while the setting and service were impressive, the food experience left me with mixed feelings.",1
19339,"I was drawn to this bar by their unique and innovative cocktail menu, which was both extensive and tempting. The ambiance is enhanced by the charming setting and the addition of live music.

It's a shame, as the potential for a great experience is evident, but the noise factor is a considerable drawback.",1
20904,"**3.5 stars **Came here in the evening and boy inside is veryyyy tight.I understand utilizing all the space but those stools were uncomfortable. If I was bigger my ass surely would not be able to sit comfortably. Besides being cramped up service was fast as hell and the server was very informative. I had a passion fruit margarita which is $7 during happy hour. While it was tasty and somewhat strong ,I am cynical of the idea that I will be given quality alcohol from a place that churns out just about any flavor margarita. For food I had chicken nachos which was really good and the interesting salmon tacos and French fries. I liked the crispiness but the salmon lacked real flavor. Considering the price ($20) I feel like the salmon to tortilla ratio was really off. The pieces of salmon were really tiny. If I were to put all of the pieces together it would only make maybe half a salmon fillet. I switched out my side of rice and beans for the French fries and they were plentiful and delicious. The prices weren't too bad the food was alrightt. If I was in the area and was craving something fast I would probably come back and try something else.",0
18860,"Title: A Crunchy, Spicy Delight in the East Village

My friends and I dropped into this casual noodle spot on a Sunday evening without a reservation and were pleasantly surprised. The complimentary edamame was a delightful starter, preparing our taste buds for what was to come. The Basil fried chicken, our choice over dumplings, was a win: superbly crunchy, tender within, and seasoned to perfection. It's a dish that alone warrants a return visit.

I customized my bowl, opting for chicken soup, noodles, fish filet, and a touch of spice. Although deliciously chewy, the noodles came with a bit more heat than anticipated – more ""medium"" than the requested ""little"" spicy. Despite the overzealous spice level, it was a satisfying bowl.

Both the spicy and regular seafood noodles featured an interesting mix of seafood – the amusing tiny crab found in a mussel made for a fun dining experience and a memorable photo op.

In conclusion, this East Village nook is your go-to for a noodle fix without the fuss of a reservation. Just be specific about your spice preference, and dive into their crispy, juicy fried chicken!",1
12739,"Not sure what all the hype about this place is.  Maybe better when it first opened 4 years ago and now they have a newer second store to manage.  Now it looks nothing like the cute photos you might see when you pull up critics' reviews or lists.  The furniture feels old and not kept clean.  As Asian fast food it's pretty pricy.  And the taste would be better if the oil they use to fry the dumplings is not stale.  We went for a light dinner,  the melamin plates were old and stained, no longer white.  The fluorescent lighting gave no warmth.  The dumplings, if you ignore the stale oil smell and greasiness, are not made badly, with thin skin and tasty fillings.  The pancake has hardly any scallions in them and not very flakey.  The green veggie is ordinary.  The secret sauce, a bit sweet and not too spicy was not bad.  Limited seating on a few tables and stools but most people seemed to be there for takeout.  Ok for a quick bite but they gotta change the frying oil more often.",0
1732,"Despite the rave reviews, my group was disappointed by our meal. We all got the shawarma plate which was quite soggy and the meat seemed drier than I was expecting. I do like that it came with a lot of salad. Usually when I get plates like these, there is barely any veggies but I definitely felt healthy eating this meal. Our group didn't realize this but there's not much seating inside. There's maybe 5ish bar seats, so it's very much a take out joint. Luckily the park is just a few steps away!",0
20274,"I remember reading somewhere that Tomo Tomo has a location in East Village and opened here. Something like that. Anyway if you see a Japanese person in line with you that ought to mean this place is solid. Urbanspace is crowded during lunch as always. I would say I waited approx 20 min from when I got on line to getting my food. I read reviews of people trying so hard to make it in time for seafood but it ran out. That's why I decided to order seafood ramen instead of the original tonkotsu. When I ordered at 12:25 there was still seafood...gudI also got gyoza as a side because it's only $2.5 more in the combo and I was craving it yesterday. Idk why I had the idea that gyoza is less filling than karaage. Appreciate how all ramen comes with pork belly, bamboo shoot, spinach, and finely chopped scallion. PackagingI appreciate how they use a separate container for the broth and the ramen+toppings. The ""dry"" container sits on top of broth container under the same lid. This is good for space saving and preventing noodles from getting soggy. It also provides enough empty space to reassemble the ramen. The problem with this is how the broth sloshed on the bottom of the dry container. When I took out the dry container, I didn't realize how the bottom was wet. Good thing I placed it on the paper bag so it wasn't too messy for me. The outside of the bowl was also oily which was an unpleasant feeling when taking out from the paper bag. BrothThe seafood broth was the thick type. I like how it clings to the ramen. The portion they give vs the amount of food and the size of the paper bowl work out in a way that the broth exactly reaches the top of the food. It has an obvious dashi base. The rest of the thickness probably comes from the pork. I'm not sure what else is there. When it said seafood I was hoping for more obvious sweetness whether from fish, shrimp, clams, etc. Also note that even though I commuted less than ten minutes after picking up my order, the broth was lukewarm when I ate it. A thin film formed in this short timeframe too which did help insulate a bit. It's also a good sign of how concentrated this broth is. NoodlesIt's thin and wavy, very smooth and strong egg flavor, chewy. This is probably my favorite type of ramen. The only complaint is with how it comes out after bringing it back. It sits as a cake kinda shape in the container. I had trouble loosening the ramen disk within the broth. Blame it on the wooden chopsticks lol. Regardless they did a good job in cooking it at a consistency that won't be too soggy by the time you eat it (not immediately)ToppingsI didn't get additional toppings nor do I think I need it. Surprised I saw a lotta ppl add tho. Pork belly - too fatty. It's like 80% fat. I don't even know how to describe the flavor because all I had was chunky fat. Good thing the fat was the solid type and not mushy type. The spinach was a bit too mushy and oxided but understandable. Appreciate the addition. Bamboo shoots were over taken by the broth so no comment. GyozaI was craving it the day before and voila I'm getting it the next day. Jk I didn't come just for the gyoza. I noticed that they have prepackaged gyoza ready to be cooked. They're in trays of 15 or something. I wonder if they buy it or it's made in some centralized kitchen. Anyway they're not memorable. Lunch combo comes with 4 pieces. There's one nicely brown pan fried side. It's not crunchy anymore by the time I eat it but I won't blame anyone. Otherwise the texture of the skin is soft, not mushy. The sauce that comes with it actually tastes like a liquidifed hoisin sauce or a thin version of what's given with cheung fun. The brightness is nice to give some character to the gyoza. ServiceAlthough the line for ordering and picking up food got long, the cashier tried to get as far as possible in the line to get people's order. At the food prep counter there's this Japanese guy who does the bagging and handing out orders. I'm wondering if he's the owner. Anyway he was super energetic and thankful when handing out orders. He'd say ""[Name] here is your order of [food], thank you so much for coming!""I also noticed when they move from touching food to touching other things they'd change gloves I was happily and surprisingly full with the combo but I probably would be satisfied with just the ramen. I can try tonkotsu any other day...and I probably will. I'm more interested in going to their sit down location. Regardless this is a very solid place but it's small things added up that make it not 5*.",0

I visited this gem on a dreary, rain-soaked afternoon and, as always, it never disappoints. I indulged in the warming embrace of their dumpling tofu soup, which arrived promptly within 15 minutes. Accompanying the main dish was an array of complimentary sides including fried fish, kimchi, and broccoli, adding a delightful variety to the meal. The flavors were spot on and for a little under $20, it was a satisfying steal. A word to the wise: to beat the lunchtime rush, particularly on Fridays, aim to arrive before noon. Highly recommended for a satisfying, wallet-friendly comfort meal.",1
15367,"Came to the restaurant on a Friday night with 2 other friends. The interior had a diner like feel and had lots of seating. To order your food, you simply check off how much of each thing you want on a paper menu. We ordered the chips and guacamole. The chips were a bit too hard and thick for me to enjoy and the guacamole could use a lot more flavor. For my meal I got 2 chicken tacos and 1 beef taco. I wasn't a fan of the beef but the chicken was amazing. They also had a spicy salsa at the table so adding that was a perfect addition. Our waiter was also really attentive and checked on us just the right amount of times. Paying was also made simple since she had a hand held payment system so we could easily split the check. The prices were reasonable and the food was delicious so I'd come back again.",0

19531,"Title: Takeout Triumph at Local Gem!

I usually don't write reviews for takeout, but in these uncertain times, it's important to know which places are offering this service. This spot is definitely open for takeout, and I'm here to vouch for its quality!

I called in my family's order directly, bypassing third-party apps. The Crab Taquitos were the first pleasant surprise, jam-packed with crab and absolutely worth every penny – they come in a serving of three. The Tacos de Pescado deserve a shoutout too; they managed to retain their flavor even after an hour's journey home, arriving in a duo.

For entrees, the Pollo en Mole Poblano didn't disappoint. It's a staple dish here for a reason: the mole sauce was rich and plentiful, a perfect match for the tender chicken. The Branzino Veracruz was a delightful catch of the day. Luckily for me, they had it in stock, fully cooked yet not dry, seasoned with expertise, and the sauce brought an excellent balance of savoriness and a tang from green olives. It was a near miss with the salmon, but I'm ecstatic that the branzino made an appearance.

Bonus points for the Margheritas to-go – a true treat in these trying times. It's clear I'm cheering for this restaurant to pull through, and can't wait to dine in person once it's safe again. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a stellar takeout experience!",1
16725,"Title: A Trendy Spot with Solid Eats but a Birthday Bummer

Last night, I dined at a popular local eatery bustling with the energy of college students. While the atmosphere was undeniably vibrant, those looking for a quieter dinner may find the noise level a tad high. Onto the food – we selected four dishes: the Pad see ew with chicken, a tofu and broccoli combo, a basil fried rice, and an elusive chicken plate that escapes memory. Each dish was a hit, but the Pad see ew stood out with its impeccable preparation.

I couldn't pass up the curry puffs, which were delightful, though I was left wanting more than the mere two provided. A major downside presented itself during our birthday celebration. We brought a modest cake to mark the occasion but were met with a surprising $10 'cake-cutting' fee, justified by the fact we didn't order from their dessert menu, which, ironically, excludes birthday cake. While the food scores high, the unexpected charge put a damper on our festivities.",1

As a frequent patron of this Korean BBQ gem in Midtown's Koreatown, I can confidently proclaim it as the best in town. The bustling, no-reservations spot is a testament to its popularity, often boasting a 1-2 hour wait on weekend evenings—a wait that's unquestionably worth it.

Spread over two floors, the expansive seating area comfortably accommodates the crowds that flock here. Despite the rush, the service remains impressively swift and the premises clean, enhancing the dining experience.

The variety of barbecue meats on offer is remarkable, and while I usually leave the ordering to my friend, I've yet to find a dish that isn't delectable. Whether you're a local or just passing through NYC, this Korean BBQ spot is an essential culinary stop.",1

11527,"Regrettably, I must advise against dining at this establishment, especially for an occasion as significant as a company lunch. The chaotic service was the initial red flag, with a staggering 30-minute wait just to place our orders. The delivery of cold bread took an hour, and that was after multiple attempts to record our orders correctly.

The main course, a pricey surf and turf, was an utter letdown. While the lobster escaped criticism, the steak, ordered medium rare, arrived alarmingly undercooked and entirely devoid of flavor, rendering the accompanying steak sauce useless in salvaging the dish. The sides were a mixed bag - the truffle fries and asparagus delivered some satisfaction, unlike the bland mashed potatoes.

Desserts were another area of inconsistency, with the same sampler arriving in varying portions, ranging from a mere spoonful to a generous jar of creme brulee. 

A word to the wise: should you manage to catch the attention of the staff, it's best to make the most of it by asking all questions and placing your order all at once. Overall, this was a dining experience that left much to be desired.",1

14152,"Title: A Vegan Haven in a Steak Lover's World - Delmonico's Delights

Review:
As a vegan, finding a satisfying meal at a steakhouse can be a tall order, but Delmonico's breaks the mold with their scrumptious vegan options. On multiple occasions, I've indulged in their vegan lasagna, which is a rare gem on a grill menu, and it's absolutely delicious. The waiter's recommendation was spot on. 

Their salad, too, is a masterpiece, featuring some of the most flavorful tomatoes I've ever tasted. Presentation is top-notch, enhancing the dining experience with visually appealing dishes. The staff's meticulous attention to detail, especially in keeping our water glasses constantly filled, does not go unnoticed.

And let's not forget the bread bowl - a tasty kickoff to the meal with a variety of spreads to choose from. Delmonico's has managed to make our special dining occasions inclusive and enjoyable for both my steak-loving boyfriend and me.

A heartfelt thank you to Delmonico's for being a trailblazer amongst steakhouses with their awesome vegan options. We're already looking forward to our next visit!",1
20776,"Visiting New York Dec 2019 and it's snowing  now it feels like Christmas!  We were starving after a 5 hr flight with some delay. We were told by a friend to Bareburger and why not since there is a location on our street we are staying.  We checked in about 8pm and were quickly seated by the hostess. It was about 3/4 full on Monday evening. The menu looks great with do many different burgers and also nice to see a vegan menu  on the 2nd page! We ordered:- coconut milkshake cookies & cream: my husband had to help me describe this as I am still sick and can't taste  but he said it had a strong coconut taste and really delicious! -So Cal burger: my burger is organic turkey with avocado, mayo, onions, alfalfa, cheese and sprout bun. It was really good considering I couldn't really taste. My husband took a few bites and he it tasted healthy. The Duke: bison, cheddar cheese, onions, mushroom, kale, tomatoes, aioli with an egg. That is a juicy and messy burger. Watching my husband eat infront of me, man not a good sight but as long as he likes it, I'm happy. He did say the bison could have more salt and add acid to the burger. He added ketchup from the table which elevated the flavour. - Moscow mule: hubby liked it. Especially at $3 special baby for Monday's. All in all, great food, fantastic table service. Would definitely come back when I can taste again.",0
20518,"Title: A Broadway Show and the Dim Sum High Note at Dim Sum Palace

After catching a dazzling Broadway musical, my appetite was as grand as the final curtain call. Having skipped proper meals for the anticipation of theater magic, my friends and I, straight from a road trip sans sustenance from Baltimore, found ourselves at Dim Sum Palace—our plan B that fatefully became our winning ticket.

Initial trepidation crept upon being seated in a seemingly forgotten corner of the restaurant. But fear not, for paranoia was replaced by waves of attentive service and a delectable ensemble of dim sum delights. Dim Sum Palace, unlike my hometown Virginia Beach spots, serves fresh dim sum any day, not limited to the covetous weekends.

The novelty of marking our choices on a laminated menu with markers added to the experience—though it led to an overly ambitious order that no mere mortal's stomach could contain. From the xiu mai that was nothing short of perfection to an array of dishes that danced on our taste buds, each selection was a star performer.

The ambiance filled quickly, a testament to the Palace's allure, and not once did we feel sidelined. Further applause goes to the spotless restrooms, a universal encore for all.

For those roaming near Broadway with dim sum cravings, Dim Sum Palace is the standing ovation you deserve. No need to venture to Chinatown—this gem is a showstopper. I recommend wholeheartedly and eagerly await my next visit, camera in hand, and appetite ready.

11128,"Title: A Bite of Hype at the Square Pizza Joint

After all the buzz, I ventured into this highly-acclaimed pizzeria with expectations sky-high, only to rate it a fair 3.8 stars. The anticipation of their honey-drizzled pizza set the bar, but the actual experience was a tad anticlimactic. It was good, don't get me wrong, but the Colony Pizza, with its slightly dry demeanor, didn't dazzle my taste buds as I had hoped it would. The Vodka Pizza with Chorizo also missed the mark slightly, as the chorizo lacked juiciness.

However, it wasn't all missed opportunities here; the sides and sandwich carried the meal. The fries were exceptionally delightful, golden and crispy. The spicy chicken sandwich was the star of the show with its succulent chicken, enhanced by a beautifully balanced sauce.

If you're considering a visit, you might want to skip the square pizza and opt for the other offerings. Rumors of their burgers being exceptional have piqued my interest, and the sandwich proved they have the potential to truly wow.",1
12306,"Confession: I've always felt indifferent about pizza. It was one of those things that was always ruined by cafeteria lunch food back in my grade school days. That feeling persisted throughout my life, and I never felt safe to admit it. All of my friends love pizza in all shapes and forms, and I never worked up the courage to say that there hasn't been a pizza that I fell in love with... until I came here.There was something magical about that first bite. My friends and I locked eyes at that instance, and shared an unspoken moment of deep intimacy. During that time, we knew that we were present for each other during this significant event. In silence, we ate. Nothing could disturb the significance of that moment, not the endless droning of the restaurant environment, not the buzzing of the busy New York streets. When we finished, we could only sit and stare, sad that it was over but content knowing that we had experienced perfection. The sauce was exquisite, the perfect balance of acidity and sweetness. The cheese is simple, yet managed to hit all of the right notes. The dough was made with a special secret ingredient: love. In that one slice, I experienced the rich history of Joe the Pizza Man, his hardships, his journey, and his life. It was over before I knew it, but I never felt such a strong connection to the food and its history. It was the perfect way to begin and end my NY trip. 5/5 stars.",0
16643,"Absolutely phenomenal! This new Chinatown spot has quickly become a favorite, serving up what is easily some of the best fried chicken NYC has to offer. Their culinary prowess doesn't stop there; the Korean dishes are equally outstanding, with the squid and cheesy rice being particularly scrumptious. Don't pass up on the spicy wings – they’re a must! And the short rib soup? Simply stellar. A solid 10/10 dining experience.",1
16124,"Truly disappointed. My expectations for per se were so high, and I left very disappointed.It was my boyfriend's dream to come visit Thomas Keller's per se in New York City. For our anniversary we decided to make the trip up to the city and book the tasting menu at per se. We also indicated that we wanted to reserve a wine pairing.We have dined at other three Michelin star restaurants and I must say this was the most disappointing wine pairing we have experienced. The wine was not picked specifically to pair with the food. Rather, we were just asked ""what type of wine we like"" and we were brought glasses that were supposed to match our food. I think the difference with a real wine pairing that was specifically hand picked for the food dishes, is that you experience something remarkable when you combine the flavors of the food + the wine. This experience was definitely below par for us. For the food itself: I feel like the tasting menu lacked creativity. When you spend the money to go to a three Michelin star restaurant and participate in a tasting menu you expect a level of surprise and wonder from the dishes. In our opinion these dishes were good, but nothing amazing and up to the caliber of expectation of a three Michelin star restaurant. The oysters and pearls were amazing. Definitely my favorite dish of the night. Everything else was okay. Really nothing special. I would suggest exploring other Michelin star options in the city.",0
13942,"I recently visited a hidden gem in Alphabet City, a no-frills, cash-only BYOB spot serving up authentic Puerto Rican cuisine. The vibrant Latin atmosphere was palpable, with lively music and local chatter setting the scene. It truly feels like a slice of the neighborhood's Hispanic culture.

The deep-fried delights here didn't disappoint, especially the alcapurias, which were a revelation at only $2.50 a plate. But the standout for me was the oxtail stew, rich and hearty with a flavor profile that was both robust and surprisingly light. It edged out the beef stew, which I'll earmark for colder days.

In summary, this eatery offers a very satisfying, budget-friendly meal that may tempt you into overindulgence. A must-visit for those seeking genuine Puerto Rican fare.",1
18207,"This place is more of a 3.5 but not enough to give a 4. I came here for lunch and although it was busy, we were seated almost immediately. The entrance is a bit small so it's easy to miss. We ordered the curry puffs and, the shrimp and calamari salad to start. The cream puffs were a bit dry for my taste and could've had a dipping sauce. It came with a chili pepper vinaigrette but wasn't really something that you could dunk in. The salad was very good and had the right amount of heat. I ordered the pad kee mao and my friend ordered the wok basil chicken. We expected both to be similar with one being noodle and the other being rice, respectively. The wok basil was minced chicken - it tasted fine but looked more like ground beef. My friend decided to order the pad Thai at that point.  The food was overall okay. I asked for spicy but it definitely was not. I asked for hot sauce, and they forgot about it. I ended up having to take it from another table by myself. And the pad Thai that we ordered took a long time to prepare leaving me eating the meal first. The place is okay. There's nothing specifically unique that makes them so much better than the others. And the service was lacking a bit in my opinion.",0
20961,"Service is by far the best thing about this place.  Portions of the food for the price is really disappointing.  I walked in on a Wednesday night asking if they had availability for 4 peeps at 7pm.  In the 5 minutes I was there I talked to three people and they were all exceptionally nice including James who works the book!  And, I was able to snag a table. This place is tiny but cute as hell.  Music is spot on similar to all of the Happy Cooking Hospitality restos.   The food is really, good including the hyped up filet of fish sandwich, the spaghetti with clams, and the pork Milanese.  The wine list is elaborative but not sure our waitress knew all wine profiles and/or was an expert in wine reccos, but let's be honest that's not the type of place this is.  It's relaxed, friendly and good (not to die for) food.",0
18853,"I absolutely adored my experience at this restaurant! The lunch special exceeded my expectations, particularly with their incredibly potent margaritas – a must-try for enthusiasts.

Also ordered Spaghetti Bolognese that was quite good and a really solid portion for the price. Definitely a solid choice.

16652,"Title: Quaint Italian Spot with Surprising Salmon

I recently dined at an Italian restaurant that initially raised my eyebrows when the waiter suggested the salmon over a classic pasta dish. However, skepticism aside, the salmon was indeed delectable, cooked to perfection and seasoned just right. This visit merits a solid 3-star rating; decent but not spectacular. While I can't vouch for the pasta yet, I plan to give it a try on a future visit.

The restaurant boasts a charming back patio that's perfect for dining al fresco on pleasant days, adding a nice touch to the overall experience. Given the limited dining options in the area, this establishment stands out as a worthwhile choice, especially if you're in need of a meal.

Be prepared for prices that feel a bit steep for a lunch menu, but they do reflect the upscale ambiance of the place. Overall, a 3-star experience based on the balance of quality and cost. Consider stopping by for a bite, and if the weather permits, enjoy the serene outdoor seating at the back.",1
11093,"I'm actually a 2.5 with 2 stars for the food, the service however was 5 stars, and the cleanliness was a 5 --it's a shame the food was just lacking. We came for a birthday celebration excited to try Daniel Boulud's restaurant but this one was underwhelming.I'm not too sure about the Mediterranean flavor here. It had spices and flavors that were off or maybe my party just didn't like. We had appetizers: black bass crudo, beef tartare and lemon asparagus chilled soup. The beef tartare had zero flavor. I wasn't drinking alcohol so I can assure you my palate was on point. The chilled soup was nice and colorful but again very subtle flavors here. Entrees: Sea Bass, American Wagyu and Spring Lamb. The Sea Bass was good, the lamb was tender and the beef was awful - had tendon and fat. We just packed it to go because there was no point in saying anything we just won't be back. The desserts were creative but again seemed like very faint flavors. The restaurant does have great service, nice decor and proximity to Lincoln Center etc but with so many choices in town - why?",0
12262,"I was really sick a few weeks ago and decided to order the thick egg udon soup with a side of white rice on Caviar. One of my better decisions. The soup was unique, flavorful and delicious.

Fantastic spot, brought me back to life.",0
3119,"During the soft opening of MonmenTea, I decided to indulge in their Galaxy Yogurt with Yakult. I customized it with passion fruit jelly, max sugar, and an extra dose of rainbow jelly. Though I had my eyes set on the red beans, they were sadly sold out. While the drink itself was divine, it was quite the sugar rush – something to note for those with a less sweet tooth. Pricing is reasonable; upgrading to a large is a mere $0.70 extra, and additional toppings like jelly or beans are only $0.50.

On the other hand, the Green Tea Mousse, priced at $9.99, was a disappointment – it didn't live up to the cost and was far from palatable. However, the saving grace was the exceedingly friendly staff, who went above and beyond to assist me in capturing the perfect photo of my vibrant drink, an effort that softened the blow of the mousse misstep.

Space is limited inside the establishment, a remnant of its former life as Alsace Bakery. However, MonmenTea has cleverly expanded within, creating a more spacious interior. The menu offers an array of hot food items, a welcome addition not found at their other location. Despite the dessert letdown, the exceptional service and the tasty, customizable drink options incline me to give this place another visit.",1
17297,"After Kottu House closed I was back on the hunt for authentic Sri Lankan food. Found this little gem via Yelp and was really excited to give it a try. Came here on a freezing night when the city was supposed to get its first snow (still yet to happen...) with a friend who's also an adventurous eater with a high tolerance for spicy food. We almost missed it with our eyes kept on the street level when it was tucked away on the second floor. Not too big of a sit-down restaurant with a take-out service counter - definitely a casual vibe. That being said, service was fast, friendly, and attentive. We shared the following:1. Appetizer Sampler - half fish and half vegetarian. The ""spring rolls"" actually reminded me more of croquettes. The batter was a bit too thick but the spices shone through.2. Kotthu Roti - we had it with chicken and it was very good! Spicy and extremely flavorful, even more so than that of Kottu House, which was a pleasant surprise to me.3. Pork Black Curry - very interesting and different. The pork was juicy and tender; the spices and herbs were heavy but not as vibrant nor flavorful as I'd like. Nevertheless, worth a try.CASH ONLY! Thank God they took Venmo and saved us a trip to the ATM in the freezing cold! I'll definitely be back to try something else and reorder the Kotthu Roti.",0
10638,"Title: A New Favorite in Curry Hill - Pippali Shines

My boyfriend and I had dinner at Pippali last night, and it quickly claimed the title of our top pick among Curry Hill's abundance of Indian eateries. Scoring a 7:45pm reservation through OpenTable for a Friday evening, we were promptly seated in the moderately bustling ambiance, observing a full house as the night progressed.

Service was commendably efficient, enhancing the dining experience alongside a parade of flavorful dishes. The Banarsi tikka appetizer set a high bar, followed by an exquisitely creamy chicken tikka masala and a rich lamb entree. The garlic naan was the perfect accompaniment, and to our delight, the ras malai dessert came complimentary, thanks to a Yelp check-in.

Our beverage choices—an imported Indian beer and a zesty ginger mule cocktail—complemented the meal perfectly. At around $100 for two, inclusive of tax and tip, the value was undeniable.

For anyone craving authentic Indian cuisine with excellent service in Curry Hill, Pippali is a must-visit. We'll certainly be back.",1
2783,"Title: A Brunch Haven for Gluten-Free Biscuit Lovers!

If you're a fan of comfort food with a gluten-free twist, look no further! These delectable gluten-free biscuits are the stars of the show – flaky, delicious, and reminiscent of grandma's kitchen. Although served with chicken jus, I recommend asking for maple syrup or molasses to dip into those Southern roots.

Brunch at this gem comes with a shareable starter and main, and the accommodating staff ensures a worry-free meal for those with allergies. The menu's flexibility for gluten-free options is impressive, and the food doesn’t skimp on flavor.

While it does get busy (expect a wait around 1pm on Saturdays), the bustling atmosphere is part of its charm. Don't miss out on the refreshing lavender lemonade to complete your experience. This place is a must-visit for a memorable and satisfying brunch!",1
14032,"Awesome Thai Food in a very cozy (err tight) location. The food's worth it all.I went here with a friend for lunch. I thought ahead a bit to make a reservation, which was smart given the very limited space indoors for eating. (pro tip!) Maybe 15 people at max and a few barstool seating. It's really cramped.Once you forget about that, you get to the important part - the food. We got the lunch special which ends up being a solid deal. One appetizer and a main course. I got the spring roll and the tofu pad thai. At first, people might wonder why I'd settle for the pad thai. Reason was that the waiter actually recommended it to me (yea I did a double take). But honestly it was so good. Not the stereotypical pad thai either. All for $15/person, not a bad deal.Other thing I recommend is the vegan white wine. Never heard of vegan wine, but it was actually pretty damn good. Worth a try if you want a drink with your lunch.",0
14851,"I had a great time here during Valentine's Day. We were able to get a table even during this crazy holiday. The restaurant was not too packed so we were able to have our own space and conversations. We each got a frozen cocktail and I highly recommend the frozen pina colada! I enjoyed the meal and the portions are pretty big, us and everyone around us were taking their leftovers to go. A big plus is the servers! Everyone was so nice and happy, it made me happy too!",0
12174,"Fantastic Mexican restaurant at Hudson yard.. though the location might be a bit inconvenient this restaurant more than makes up for it.As you enter, you are greeted by gorgeous interiors and smiling staff.

We enjoyed every bit of it.Shishto peppers were lightly burnt and crispy... Served with dash of lemon.. It's difficult to get shishto peppers wrong but by then I was totally biased to this place and enjoyed every dish they were serving. The berros water cress salad was lush green and super fresh..

2004,"Title: A Bite of Indulgence at Maison Kayser

On my latest visit to Maison Kayser, I treated myself to the Iberico sandwich, which has become my favorite indulgence despite its higher price point. Opting for the larger size this time, I realized the smaller version does manage to satisfy without overwhelming.

The Iberico ham's rich flavors, coupled with the sweetness of fig, create a delightful sweet and savory balance that is simply divine. However, the experience was slightly marred by the overly tough bread, which made eating the sandwich by hand a bit of a struggle. Also, be prepared for a bit of mess as the seeds on top tend to scatter amidst the effort it takes to take a bite.

In all, Maison Kayser's Iberico sandwich is a treat well worth the splurge, though a softer bread would elevate the experience to pure perfection.",1
18219,"Title: A Delightful Surprise at Lucky's

I recently dined at Lucky's and it was a delightful experience, especially considering that I'm not typically a fan of dumplings. Their spicy curry pork dumplings were a standout for me, boasting a perfectly balanced curry flavor that didn't overpower the succulent taste of the pork. This was an accidental discovery, as the menu didn't clearly differentiate between the spicy pork and spicy curry pork, but it was a happy mistake that I'd gladly make again.

The siracha slaw served alongside was also impressive, delivering a punch of flavor that complemented the dumplings well. Although I'm a pickle enthusiast who even makes my own pickle pops at home, I found Lucky's pickle ice cream to be a miss for my personal taste, as it veered a bit too tart and sweet.

Despite this, Lucky's has won me over and earned my recommendation. It's certainly a place I would revisit for another round of their delectable dumplings and slaw. Lucky's is a must-try for both dumpling aficionados and skeptics alike!",1
20316,"In spite of the name, my favorite dish is actually the salt and pepper chicken over rice since it is super filling comfort food (though I've had the pork chop over rice and it's pretty good too). Their traditional Taiwanese ice dessert is super good especially on a hot summer day.",0
11474,"I stumbled upon a hidden gem on a surprisingly empty afternoon. The buzz around their famed pepperoni squares had reached me, and curiosity led the way. I opted for a to-go pepperoni with jalapeño and sausage on a Detroit-style base. Reheated at home, it lost none of its charm. The balance of robust sauce, generous toppings, and just-right cheese was bliss on well-crafted breading. However, the price did give me a moment's pause—it seemed steep for the size. For this reason alone, a solid four stars feels fitting for this otherwise delightful eatery.",1
10047,"Unfortunately nothing really stood out to me. Would I return? Maybe, if I am in the area. The service was great. The food came out quickly. The waiter was cool. We started with the chips and guacamole. The guacamole was the best part of the meal. We, then, ordered two burgers with bacon, well done. The burgers had no flavor... not even the bacon and drowning it in ketchup helped. The fries were super soggy. I enjoyed the vanilla boozy shake, even though you could barely taste the alcohol.I was so unsatisfied that I did not order desserts even though it felt like the waiter was pushing it on us. Oh, and it took forever to get the bill-- annoying.",0
20898,"Sao Mai delivers with good service, tasty Vietnamese food, and a decent ambiance. Came in and was seated right away. Did not have to wait for menus or to order. The staff was waiting patiently and was at our table as soon as we were ready to order. The food also came very fast and we were not disappointed.  Very tasty spring rolls! Added bonus that they have their own hot sauce which I really liked.   P.S Prices are cheaper compared to nearby restaurants. Also, they are not shy in the quantity they give. It's a pretty solid spot to go to when your on a budget, want to eat a lot and craving something tasty. You won't be disappointed.",0
11649,"Title: Southern Charm in the LES: A Root & Bone Review

Nestled in the Lower East Side, Root & Bone presents itself as a delightful enclave perfect for a brunch outing. My visit during NYC Restaurant Week introduced me to their brunch prix fixe menu, which was a steal, especially when we opted to indulge in the 'Make it Boozy' option for an extra $22.

The fare was a testament to Southern culinary prowess, from the flaky buttered biscuits to the exquisite lightness of the deviled eggs. The star of the meal, however, was undoubtedly the fried chicken and waffles basket. Both white and dark meats were succulent and remarkably flavored, easily placing Root & Bone's rendition among the best Southern fried chicken in the city. While the mac and cheese and home fries were merely satisfactory, they didn't detract from the overall quality of the meal.

The boozy option elevated the experience further. I savored the rosé, my companion the champagne, and we appreciated the flexibility to switch between drinks without the entire table having to conform to one choice. The attentive service ensured our glasses remained filled throughout the allocated 90 minutes, sparing us the all-too-common experience of having to flag down servers for a refill.

My sole gripe relates to the snug seating arrangement. The charm of the small space is slightly marred by the proximity to fellow diners, which can feel a bit intrusive during a meal.

In summary, Root & Bone offers an inviting atmosphere and a satisfying Southern brunch experience, making it a standout spot in the LES — just be prepared for cozy quarters.",1
13929,"Title: A Missed Step for The Smith in East Village

I'm a regular at The Smith's other outposts, but the East Village location was a first-time visit for Sunday brunch. Despite a 10am reservation and being one of the early groups seated, service was oddly slow to start, lagging behind those who arrived later. The table was promptly set with water options, followed by a courtesy serving of bread with butter.

Understanding the limited menu due to a recent kitchen fire, we opted for French Toast and Johnny Eggs Benedict with a side of waffle fries. Unfortunately, the meal didn't hit the high marks I've come to expect from The Smith. The Eggs Benedict suffered from dry, seemingly pre-made cornbread, and the accompanying greens were unseasoned and plain. The French toast, although flavorful, had patches that were undercooked. The waffle fries were disappointingly lukewarm.

As much as I appreciate The Smith, this brunch experience fell short. The overall quality and attention to detail that I've enjoyed in the past were missing here, leaving me hesitant to return for another brunch.",1
15158,"Title: A Stellar Culinary Experience at Felidia During NYC Restaurant Week

I recently revisited Felidia for NYC Restaurant Week and my fond memories from three years ago were not only met but exceeded. The reservation process was seamless, complete with a considerate confirmation call the day before.

Upon arrival, we were seated on the more intimate second floor, and the ambiance was just perfect for the occasion. The hospitality was impeccable; every staff member exuded warmth and readiness to accommodate our requests, including an endless supply of bread.

The special Restaurant Week three-course dinner was a steal at $42, but naturally, I ventured beyond to indulge in their regular offerings. The casked Negroni was an impeccable start, followed by an exceptional pappardelle with lamb ragu. The black truffle pasta, though at a $25 premium, was a masterpiece—its al dente perfection exemplifying the care put into each dish.

A minor hiccup occurred when we received two tiramisus instead of a panna cotta, but the error was swiftly rectified with impressive efficiency. They even allowed us to keep the extra dessert, a testament to their customer-centric approach. 

Both desserts were divine, with the panna cotta and its unbelievably crisp choux and velvety filling simply melting in my mouth. An assortment of complimentary sweets rounded out the meal, although some were a tad too sweet for my palate.

My experience at Felidia was one for the books. With exceptional food, service, and atmosphere, it remains a restaurant I will continually return to. It's an establishment that truly understands the value of every penny and dime spent by its guests.",1
16218,"Title: Industrial Chic Seafood Delight in the Meatpacking District

Nestled in the vibrant Meatpacking District, this industrial-chic seafood restaurant is a gem that surpasses expectations. Yes, it's on the pricier side, but every dish justifies the cost with its impeccable quality.

My culinary journey began with a dozen exquisitely shucked oysters, half from the West Coast, half from the East, each bursting with freshness. Following the oysters, the Hellfire roll was a revelation, so much so that my date pondered ordering a second round - it was that impressive.

For the main course, the snapper fillet was a masterpiece, sporting a perfectly crispy skin while maintaining a moist and flaky interior. Paired with lobster-infused mashed potatoes, it was a harmonious blend of flavors. The Brussels sprouts and truffle fries, ordered as sides, were equally exceptional, rounding out the meal beautifully.

Dessert was a showstopper with warm ricotta doughnuts and a quartet of dipping sauces. The raspberry compote stood out the most, reminiscent of a delectable jelly doughnut.

The restaurant itself boasts a popular rooftop lounge, ideal for enjoying warmer months, and caters to various dining preferences with three bars and versatile seating arrangements. Whether you're after a romantic evening or a group gathering, this spot has you covered. Its proximity to both the new downtown Whitney museum and the High Line only adds to its appeal.

Reservations are a must in this coveted locale. And I, for one, cannot wait to return for more of those heavenly Hellfire rolls.",1
20386,"Title: A Haven for Empanada Lovers

If you're yearning for a taste of South Florida's empanada scene, Empanada Mama is your go-to spot. The empanadas here are a home run—stuffed with savory fillings that transport you right back to the sunshine state. Both the chicken and beef options stood out as personal favorites, fulfilling all my empanada cravings.

However, it's best to steer clear of the tacos. They were a letdown, with overcooked, chewy carnitas and haphazardly thrown-on toppings. Stick to what Empanada Mama does best: empanadas.

In terms of service, it's decent, but don't expect lightning-fast attention—it's a solid 3/5. For those on a college budget, your wallet won't groan, and the relaxed atmosphere makes it perfect for a laid-back meal or a late-night bite.

All in all, I rate the food a 4/5, focusing solely on their empanadas. Would I return and recommend the place? Absolutely—but I'm here for the empanadas and empanadas only.",1

2243,"One a scale of 1 to 10, Atomix is an 11! From the outside, it looks like you are walking into an apartment building. The interior is contemporary and simple. The staff is warm and welcoming. There is no formal dress code, but I wouldn't wear sweats. The fact that they only have 14 seats at Chef's Counter gives you a feeling of dining in a secret spot. This also allows the staff to give each person customized attention. There is a bar upstairs with five seats that is open to walk-ins. As well as some lounge seating that can be reserved. I found the easiest way to make a reservation was on the app, Tock. They do require a deposit per person for the lounge seating, or a prepaid reservation for Chef's Counter (only two seatings per night). It also looks like they are only taking reservations two months out, for the time being.Their food was very innovative and pleasing to the palate. There is no menu, but we were able to put in a request ahead of time that should scallops be used, if they could be substituted due to an allergy. The chef was accommodating. Each course is accompanied with a card explaining the ingredients and how the story behind Chef choosing to combine those ingredients. The cards might be wordy for some, but I enjoyed the added knowledge. Before the dining started, we chose chopsticks from a variety of ornate choices. We were also provided with a different piece of silverware for each dish, should you not want to use chopsticks. A supplement of white truffles was offered as an add-on to either one savory course and/or one dessert course; I chose to add to both. Then, the assembling and presenting of dishes began. Every dish was meticulously prepared and delivered by choreographed service.To start, half of us enjoyed the first three ""snacks"" at Chef's Counter, while the other half were served the ""snacks"" in a little seating area at the bottom of the stairs. We had 10 courses in total, each course being better than the next:Course 1 - Saeng chae: raw vegetables: moo radish and yellowtail.Course 2 - Hwe: raw fish or meat: langoustine tartareCourse 3 - Suk chae: cooked vegetables: winter squash with caviar and preserved chili pepper foam.Course 4 - Jjim: steamed or broiled: king crab with king crab stock and mustard seed oil. Added shaved whited truffles.Course 5 - Guk: soup: muscle broth with monkfish liver custard and hen of the wood mushrooms.Course 6 - Twigim: fried scallops from Japan with mustard puree and gim sauce.Course 7 - Gui: grilled tilefish from Japan with sea urchin sauce and white kimchi.Course 8 - Tang: soup boiled with many ingredients: lamb saddle with perilla seed sauce.Course 9 - Ipgasim: palate cleanser: ginger mousse with cinnamon broth, persimmon glaze, black pepper oil and popping candy.Course 10 - Husik: dessert: black chestnut ice cream, lacto fermented pyogo caramel, braised sunflower seed and pyogo crumble.I was beyond pleased with the food, the service, the drinks and the entire experience as a whole! If you enjoy tastings and have an open palate, definitely add Atomix to your list!",0
10786,"Have you walked by and spotted these long, golden doughnuts, dusted with sugar and more? These churros are Dulcinea's calling card, but they aren't all they've got at the stand. They've got creme brulee and PB&J doughnuts, sweet breads (not to be confused with sweetbreads - think banana bread and lemon loaves), horchata, empanadas and more. I have yet to try the empanadas because if I'm going to eat an empanada I'm not going for the baked variety, but everything else has been solid. The churros are the star of the show though. They've got the classics served with chocolate dipping sauce, as well as some filled with dulce de leche or nutella. If you're feeling really frisky though, try a churro ice cream sandwich. It's doughnuts and ice cream. Can't be bad. And the ones that initially caught your eye by the register? Don't worry, those stale ones just for show; they'll fry yours fresh to order.Like many a vendor, Dulcinea started out at Smorgasburg, and opened up a permanent location here. It's an excellent sweet end to a culinary tour of this fine basement of edibles, so check them out.",0

3062,"Title: A Homely Gem in Chinatown – Affordable Delights at a Quaint Hong Kong Style Café

Upon stepping into this charming Hong Kong style café nestled in the heart of Chinatown, you're instantly enveloped by the nostalgic embrace of simple, satisfying home cooking. As a culinary haven for budget-conscious foodies, this quaint spot has swiftly become a treasured favorite of mine.

The stars of the menu are unpretentiously delightful. The egg and sausage rice dish is a heartwarming homage to familiar flavors, while the baked Portuguese chicken curry offers a comforting fusion of East meets West that I find myself returning for time and again. Even the humble veggies drenched in oyster sauce conjure up memories of my mother's kitchen.

For those with a sweet tooth, the irresistible combination of sweet condensed milk paired with crispy fried buns will transport you straight back to the flavors of home.

Service here is brisk, ensuring you're not left waiting - a boon for the hungry diner. However, bear in mind that it's a cash-only establishment, so come prepared.

While most of the menu items are hits, there are a couple that I'd suggest skipping — namely the curry fish balls and cola wings, which fall short of the high notes struck by other dishes.

In sum, if you're seeking an escape to a culinary corner of Hong Kong without breaking the bank, look no further than this delightful little café in Chinatown.",1
2333,"Title: A Slice of Heaven in NY

I recently visited this pizza joint in NY and it was an absolute game-changer, so much so that my friends from Chicago whispered heretical praises for it over their beloved deep dish. Trust me, when a Chicagoan hints at a preference for NY-style pizza, you're dealing with something special.

Payment is a breeze with credit card acceptance. Despite the challenge of narrowing down the best pizza spots in NY, I was drawn back here twice in a three-day span. The ingredients scream freshness, and if there's a pesto pizza on the menu, do yourself a favor and try it – it's a culinary masterpiece.

Be prepared for a standing-room-only vibe with counter ordering. Prices are fair, with most slices ranging from $4-5. The Sicilian pepperoni slice seems to have reached celebrity status and rightfully so.

Timing is everything. A Friday night saw me in a brief 5-10 minute line, while a rainy Sunday afternoon welcomed me with no wait. If New York pizza is on your bucket list, make sure this place is at the top.",1
20319,"This is still one of my favorite places for pho. The place was packed since it's cold out. This time I also ordered a bahn min which I had never at here, surprisingly it was quite good. The pho came piping hot and very welcomed for a cold day. The service was fast and friendly. We also ordered the shrimp green papaya salad which was delicious. Will definitely keep coming back.",0
16926,"Title: A Love Affair with Al Pastor at Manhattan's Hidden Gem

From the very first bite, I was questioning if I had just met the love of my life in the form of an al pastor taco. This little slice of heaven made me deeply regret not ordering a dozen. Absolutely skip the carne asada – the al pastor here is the star. Yes, opt for the homemade corn tortilla, even if you're a skeptic like me; it's a game-changer – delicate, soft, yet perfectly containing the saucy, flavorful, and moist meat. And the salsa? Divine as it is, it's almost unnecessary given the explosion of flavors already present. 

As someone who's no stranger to the renowned Mexican food of San Diego, LA, and Santa Ana, I'm putting it out there: this Manhattan spot might just eclipse my all-time favorite, Tacos El Gordo. If you're anywhere in Manhattan and craving a taco that will sweep you off your feet, this is your must-visit destination.",1
12074,"Discovering Barnacho was a stroke of serendipity for which my taste buds will forever be grateful. This culinary gem rivals my beloved Mexican spot in FiDi, offering an experience that is both vibrant and satisfying. Despite its bustling atmosphere on a Thursday evening, my friend and I were content to perch at the bar where the drinks - a strawberry mojito for me and a mango margarita for her - were simply divine.

The meal commenced with their renowned shrimp fritters, which defied all preconceptions. A heavenly trio of juicy shrimp, creamy guacamole, and crisp tostones had me at hello. It was a dish that compelled love at first bite.

We proceeded to indulge in the BarNachos, an impressive mountain of nachos that did not skimp on toppings. The no-meat version came loaded with a tempting mix of three cheeses, black beans, jalapenos, sour cream, and pico de gallo. Despite its size, we devoured the dish with gusto, satiating our hearty appetites.

In a moment of overzealous ordering, we added the steak tacos to our feast. While I don’t remember the specifics of their taste - a testament to how full I was - the memory of their existence alone promises a focused sampling on my inevitable return. And yes, the shrimp tacos are already on my radar, with expectations set sky-high by the fritters.

Cailin's Recommendations? Don’t miss the Tostadas de Cameron (Shrimp Fritters), a steal at $16, and the Strawberry Mojito, reasonably priced at $12, for an infusion of rum and fresh mint. Barnacho has solidified its place as my go-to for Mexican cuisine that truly hits the spot.",1
10891,"Title: A Beyond Belief Burger Experience

I recently visited a spot that served up an ""Incredible"" beyond burger, and it truly lived up to that description. The burger, adorned with a phenomenal chipotle aioli and savory pickles, converted me into a pickle-on-burger enthusiast.

Equally impressive were the brined fries. Despite a price tag of $5.95, the generous portion could easily satisfy two or more people. It pained me to leave any behind.

At $19.49 for the meal, it's not the cheapest option, but the exceptional quality and service justify the cost. Plus, opting for the combo at $18, which includes a burger, fries, and a drink, is a steal.

The staff's friendliness added to the experience, along with a sample of their delightful turmeric mustard - a perfect fries accompaniment.

Although not conveniently located for me, I'm eager for their potential delivery service. I'll definitely be bringing all my friends here, vegan or otherwise. This place is a must-visit!",1
12606,"We had a fantastic experience at the restaurant, where the ambiance was enhanced by the charming wallpaper in the dining room. Attention to cleanliness was evident, with the bathroom being spotless. Our bartender, D, truly stood out with his cool demeanor, friendliness, and outstanding hospitality. The drinks didn't disappoint either; the beers were served ice-cold and the shot hit just the right spot. Although we didn't get a chance to dine this time, observing a satisfied couple nearby convinced us to try the food on our next visit. We're definitely coming back, and maybe next time, we'll see if D is up for a celebratory shot of Jamo with us!",1
3158,"Thank GOD for this place staying open during COVID. I think we've ordered from there about 5 times a week or so on average, reliably, and we haven't gotten sick of it yet. It checks all the boxes. Affordable? Yes. Big portions? Yes. Reliable pickup and well-packaged? Yes. Delicious? Oh yes. My go-to is the lumache with Sunday Sauce ($18) but my boyfriend loves the cavatelli with carbonara ($17). The garlic pecorino is bangin' as well. We tried the butternut squash noodles with mushroom ragu ($17) and were underwhelmed, but it wasn't bad, just not our taste.They have a good selection of apps. The calamari ($14) is good and a massive portion. First time I've ordered calamari and thought ""this is almost too much calamari."" It's heavy on the rings which I like too. The mix and match is perfect so you can choose the exact pasta shape that you want. They also package up their AMAZING breadsticks for takeout which are great dipped in your leftover sauce (if you like to scrape the plate like I do). Anyway, I've raved enough. Love Aunt Jake's.",0
16831,"Title: Cozy Cafe with Hits and Misses

I recently visited a local Hong Kongnese cafe hoping to find all the comforts of traditional fare, and while there were highlights, a couple of shortcomings kept the experience from being perfect.

On the positive side, the Hong Kong ni-tza (milk tea) was a sweet, milky delight, revealing the mastery of a classic. The mantou with condensed milk, despite being a tad greasy, satisfied my sweet tooth with its decadent flavor. The home-style tofu hit the mark, delivering on the authentic taste I craved. Service was notably friendly, a pleasant divergence from what you might encounter at nearby competitors.

However, the meal had its disappointments. The turnip cakes (lo bo gau) were an oily letdown with a fishy smell to the oil, lacking the flavor I had anticipated. The veg and mushroom noodles had the foundations of a great dish, with palatable gravy and a nice noodle texture, but were marred by the use of canned mushrooms—a personal deal breaker. I would've preferred the dish sans the canned mushrooms, even if it meant keeping the price unchanged.

Lastly, the absence of cheong fun on the menu was a puzzling omission, though it's possible I might have missed it.

Overall, while the cafe certainly serves up some comforting and tasty options, there’s room for improvement in ingredient quality and dish execution. 3/5 stars.",1
2875,"Title: A Hidden Gem - The Handpulled Noodle

If you ever find yourself wandering the neighborhood in search of an exceptional gastronomic delight, look no further than The Handpulled Noodle. A serendipitous discovery led me to this quaint eatery, and what a find it was!

Craving something spicy and soul-warming, I ordered their ribbon noodles in both beef and lamb soup variations. The depth of flavor in each bowl was remarkable, with a perfect spicy kick that didn't drown in chili oil. The noodles themselves boasted a satisfying chewiness, though thinner options are available for those who prefer a different texture.

The pricing is fair for the generous portions served, but the option to add more noodles for an extra charge is a welcomed one (though unnecessary for my ample meal). The real showstopper, however, were the homemade steamed dumplings. An absolute must-try; their juicy, well-seasoned filling was encapsulated by a delicate wrapper, best savored with a touch of chili oil and vinegar.

To wash it all down, their lychee tea was a refreshing companion. The service matched the quality of the food – the servers were both amiable and knowledgeable.

In conclusion, The Handpulled Noodle earns an effortless 5 stars. It's a definitive must-visit for locals and passersby alike.",1
3520,"Excellent dumpling house dumplings were not great, but EXCELLENT :)To be honest, there are a ton of dumpling shops in Manhattan. (Chinatown: the land of dumplings. Hole in the wall places are the best!) So why did I choose this over the others? Location location location... It was one of the handful in midtown that was highly rated and after having tried it, I agree!We tried the chicken dumplings (fried) + shrimp + seafood dumplings. The menu is a bit misleading. The seafood dumplings are actually shrimp and the shrimp are actually crab + scallions. Confusing, but not life threatening. The ambience was pretty calm for a Saturday night. A few couples, families and locals.I would not come back only because I would love to try other spots but I still highly recommend it.Also a side note: the waiter/manager was a bit.. overbearing? Not sure if that's the right word but let's say he definitely made an impression re/ table service.",0
13077,"Alan and Kevin got it right. Delicious, affordable, home-style love. Checked this restaurant out yesterday night and really loved the food and service. Three of us ordered guacamole $13 loved the kick in this--very flavorful; fried sweet plaintains $5 I wanted to buy this molé; a hongos yi espinaca quesadilla $8, a huitlacoche quesadilla $8 yummmm; a bistec quesadilla $8 soooo good; a side of rice (with corn, carrots and peas) $5 really tasty, and a Mexican coke. Everything was super delish, probably the best quesadillas I've ever eaten in my life (full disclosure: I haven't eaten that many, but these definitely stood out regardless). Even after the meal I was reflecting on how good these quesadillas were...lol. After dinner, we chatted briefly with Kevin and learned that the restaurant aimed to create the experience of eating an authentic home style Mexican meal. Alan himself was personally making all the food in the kitchen by himself. So it took a little longer, but well worth it! Also Kevin was the only server holding down the service since they were short-staffed. This place just opened 2 months ago, they moved in and prepped the space 10 days after the previous tenants moved out. So we were really impressed by not only by their food, but also their hustle. We will be back!!",0

Although they'd run out of gyoza, we dove into a diverse spread including grilled squid, salmon sashimi, karage, and ramen. The squid, while not overly fishy, could have benefited from a flavor boost. However, the remaining dishes impressed—particularly the curry ramen, which I found delightful. The sashimi was notably fresh, reinforcing the restaurant as a solid choice for satisfying late-night cravings.",1
18236,"Title: Satisfying Start to a Shopper's Day at The Cupping Room Cafe

My best friend and I recently visited The Cupping Room Cafe in Soho, a perfect kickoff spot for our much-anticipated holiday shopping spree. This ""cute lil' cafe"" defies Soho norms, offering spacious seating and the convenience of early opening hours at 8 am along with reservations.

The breakfast menu delivered a comprehensive spread. We indulged in a delectable chocolate croissant (4/5), served appetizer-style, with the pastry proving buttery and laced with warm chocolate. The southern mix platter (4/5), a hearty mix of eggs, bacon, and pancakes, was filling, though the pancakes fell slightly short of our Bubby's comparison. Their famous eggs benedict (4/5) featured a poached egg and Canadian bacon atop an English muffin, which was tasty despite the bacon being tough to slice. The home fries (5/5) were a surprise hit, perfectly crunchy outside with a soft interior.

Service was swift, which is a significant plus for a bustling Soho cafe. Prices were a bit steep, but expected for the area. Overall, The Cupping Room Cafe is a solid choice for large groups or anyone in need of a reliable, hearty breakfast to fuel a day of shopping.",1
12740,"Title: A Vietnamese Gem in Chinatown

I recently dined at this Vietnamese spot nestled in the heart of Chinatown and it thoroughly satisfied my cravings. Despite the bustling atmosphere at 8:30PM, the service was a cut above the rest – attentive and prompt, without being rushed, even as they catered to a nearly full house.

The proximity to the Grand St. Subway is a bonus, making it easily accessible for a quick and casual meal. The menu stuck to Vietnamese staples, offering a variety of Pho options and classic rice plates. My partner's choice of Pho with tender, rare beef brisket in a flavorful broth was a hit, while my grilled chicken over rice was the epitome of simplicity, executed to juicy perfection.

A special nod goes to the classic soda with egg yolk – a personal favorite – which did not disappoint. All in all, this place holds its own, even compared to my usual go-to spots on Baxter Street. Heartily full and content, I left with plans to return. Definitely a recommendable experience for anyone craving Vietnamese cuisine in the area.",1
13642,"Title: A Birthday Dinner with Memorable Starters at a Quaint Eatery

My recent visit to this charming restaurant, which brought back memories of a past lunch, was for a friend's birthday dinner. The ambiance did not disappoint, featuring a semi-open kitchen and an eclectic mix of table styles. Tucked away at a cozy corner table, the setting was perfect for our special occasion.

The appetite was robust, and the arancini and meatball starters were the stars of the evening, so delectable they could have sufficed for my entire meal. We couldn’t resist the mozzarella paired with the exquisite ""black label"" prosciutto, a choice I would happily make again.

While most of the table chose the lamb ragu for the main course, it fell a tad short on flavor. However, the dessert course offered some surprises. A slice of cheesecake for the birthday celebrant presented an unusual, ultra-soft texture, while the tiramisu pleasantly surprised me, a usual skeptic. The cannolis, however, missed the mark with their unconventional twist and excessive lemon and berry sauce.

In retrospect, the appetizers were the highlight, so much so that should I return, I might opt for a tapas-style meal made up entirely of these small plates.",1
18508,"Title: Cozy Eats with Hits and Misses

My recent dining experience at this local spot was a mixed bag, but certain dishes shone brightly. I headed in for dinner on a weekday and was pleased to be seated immediately at the bar. The service was prompt with menus, but a small hiccup occurred as we had to ask for water post-ordering – a step that should be standard.

Diving into the menu, we sampled the chicken karaage, butamoyasi, and a small tako salad. The karaage was a middle-of-the-road affair – commendably crispy but on the dry side, earning a modest 2.5 out of 5. The star of the night, the butamoyasi, was a heavenly combination of fatty pork belly and crunchy bean sprouts, which was so delightful we doubled down on our order. This dish alone warrants a return visit.

The tako salad, however, was underwhelming and somewhat misleading with its size – minuscule with a mere two pieces of tako that barely offered a taste to share. 

A personal note on dining out with food allergies: I believe restaurants should be equipped with basic allergy accommodations. I found myself in a pinch without my own medication, and while the staff was friendly, they seemed taken aback by my request for assistance in this area.

The ambiance struck the perfect note – intimate and dimly lit, creating a warm setting suitable for a date night or a relaxed meal.

Service: 4/5
Food: 3.5/5
Ambiance: 4/5

Overall, despite some culinary missteps, the fantastic butamoyasi and charming atmosphere suggest potential for a better experience on a future visit.",1
3639,"Tucked away in Chinatown, this charming restaurant elevates the hotpot experience with its unlimited drinks and dessert offering. At $36 per person for dinner, the value comes through with the all-you-can-eat model that includes a personalized touch—choose two broth flavors for a tailor-made feast. I opted for a mild spice level on their fiery broth alongside a soothing herb and pork variety, creating a delightful contrast. The sensible option to amp up the heat upon request caters to all palates.

Ordering is streamlined with a paper menu from which you can pick your favorites. The inclusion of unlimited drinks and sweet treats in the deal sets this establishment apart, justifying the price. A delightful surprise was the mini fridge stocked with Yakult, adding a nostalgic and refreshing touch to the meal.

Admittedly, service can lag a touch, likely due to being understaffed, but the relaxed pace was offset by placing a substantial initial order. With only one bathroom available behind a discreet curtain, plan accordingly. While not as crowded as other hotpot joints, this spot doesn't skimp on quality or satisfaction. Highly recommend for a gratifying hotpot experience.",1
15024,"NYC and the UWS has a lot of subpar French establishments.  Count Bistro Cassis as one of them.  For the prices they charge, their food needs a major revamp and improvement.  The family stopped by for dinner and we ordered a bunch of standard French fare: onion soup (too much sherry), steak (both of our steaks were cooked wrong and tough), and duck (dry).  To be honest, all of our food was just subpar.  Nothing tasted good.  Everything was pretty bland and forgettable.  The decor is standard UWS bistro and the restaurant is pretty small.  Service was so-so, the staff seemed pretty apathetic.  Prices here are pretty steep ($30-$40 per entree) for below average food.  UWS prices are about the same but I really was disappointed with our experience.  The one good thing was the pate that came with the complimentary baguettes.  Not coming back.",0
15804,"Title: A Supreme Start to the Day at [Restaurant Name]

After an early flight, my friends and I were craving an unconventional breakfast, so we decided on pizza at [Restaurant Name] around 10:30 AM. We all agreed, pizza is a meal for any time of the day.

We ordered the Supreme Pie. Unfortunately, due to dietary restrictions, one friend had to pass, leaving two of us to tackle the sizable dish. The pizza did not disappoint; every bite was a delightful mix of fresh toppings, perfectly melted cheese, and a crust that struck an excellent balance between crunch and thickness. It quickly ranked as one of the best pizzas I've had in years.

The pie took about 20 minutes to prepare, which was reasonable for the quality we received. For those in a rush, they also offer pizza by the slice with pre-made pies ready to go.

The restaurant's cozy size did create a bit of a seating challenge, and navigating the space was a bit of a dance with other patrons. The walls were adorned with photos of celebrities with the owner, adding a unique charm to the place.

Price-wise, the Supreme Pie came in at $30, which seemed fair for the quality and size. While splitting it between two might be a challenge, it's a good value for a group.

In summary, [Restaurant Name] delivers on fresh, delicious pizza that's clearly earned its fame. The place was already drawing a crowd by the time we left, signaling its popularity. Without a doubt, it's a spot I'll be returning to.",1

I didn't love our waiter (not an upbeat personality) but I didn't care. I ordered a grey goose cosmo and he ordered a bourbon. The waiter was a little hesitant with us taking time to savor our drinks and not order quickly. He kept coming back to see if we were ready. When we were ready, we ordered a delicious appetizer of octopus - definitely delicious! For my main course, I ordered dorado (a white flaky fish) which was delicious -it was pan seared with tomatoes and the other dish was the special black spaghetti of the evening. We had coffee to top it off. The place was very busy but not too noisy for us to carry on our conversation. I liked the vibe very much. It's not cheap so be prepared to drop a few bucks here. The bathroom is unisex and I totally loved the wallpaper in it (with stars)!",0
2451,"I love this place, and am entirely convinced it's one of the most underrated lunch deals in NYC. The first time I dined here, it was for a work dinner and my table had ordered a multitude of courses and bottles of wine. Every seafood dish was amazing--the freshly grilled langustines, scallop, salmon sashimi, sardines, soft-shelled crab, grilled whole fish--all of which were flown in fresh from the Mediterranean and selected by our table from the beautiful display at the front of the restaurant. Even the sides were delicious! I especially enjoyed the Milos Special, which was a tower of thinly sliced and fried zucchini and eggplant with a delicious tzatziki dip, as well as the Greek salad, which was simple but so, so fresh. But during the dinner, I couldn't help but think--there was no way I could afford this comfortably on my own This grand feast was definitely more than my personal budget could handle, but when I found out about their insane 3-course prix fixe lunch menu (available weekends as well!) for only $32, I was FLOORED.

20014,"Title: A True Hidden Gem with Unforgettable Flavors

From the moment I stepped into this unassuming restaurant, I knew I had stumbled upon a hidden treasure. Opting for the pick-two lunch menu, I savored a perfectly seasoned hummus and chicken shish kabob, while my companion indulged in the Baba ganoush and chicken Adana - both dishes were bursting with flavor and authenticity.

An off-the-cuff inquiry about the Turkish herb bread we'd spotted on Yelp led to a delightful surprise when the owner personally presented us with the aromatic bread, paired with a vibrant red beet spread known as ""pink sultan."" Despite being nearly full from our entrees, we couldn't resist the freshly baked bread and its scrumptious accompaniment.

As we declined dessert in surrender to our contented appetites, the owner surprised us yet again, this time with samples of pumpkin and a feather-light flan that I simply had to taste. Each bite was a testament to the restaurant's commitment to leaving guests with a lasting impression of warmth and generosity.

Concluding my New York City culinary adventures at this establishment was a decision I'll forever cherish. It's not just the outstanding food that makes this place remarkable, but the exceptional staff and welcoming atmosphere too.

I recently opted for delivery from [Restaurant Name] and was thoroughly impressed by the rapid service. My expectations were exceeded when the order not only arrived promptly but was also warm and accurate.

The highlight was the London Burger, served on a sesame seed potato brioche bun that provided an irresistible crunch. It was requested rare and executed flawlessly; the beef tasted fresh, the bacon added the perfect crisp, and the accompanying sauce was rich in flavor. It’s a burger I’d urge any enthusiast to try.

Additionally, the Truffle Fries were a hit among my co-workers and me. The blend of truffle, Parmesan, and herbs on crispy fries was sublime.

Value-wise, the prices are very reasonable considering the quality of the meal, which even included an unexpected treat of Cape Cod potato chips.

Based on this delightful encounter, I’m eager to explore more of [Restaurant Name]'s menu. This was an excellent experience that has won them a repeat customer.",1
10690,"3PM and not having had lunch yet, my fiancé and I were so hungry and ready to eat anything! Just finishing the Spring Break Art Show and previously talking about Thai food, we wanted some Thai food nearby! That's when we stumbled upon Peak Thai Restaurant. Luckily there weren't that many people inside Peak, although I wouldn't expect Peak to be booming at 3PM. Once we spoke with the waitress, we were able to seat ourselves anywhere we wished. Although we were ready to order, it probably wasn't until about 10 minutes later that the waitress came back to take our order. We ordered some roti as an appetizer and split the seafood padcha as well as a cool glass of Thai tea. The Thai tea and roti came out about the same time, which was about 8 minutes. The Thai tea was very creamy, and it wasn't as bold as most Thai Tea. Still delicious nonetheless! The roti was our favorite part of the Peak Thai experience! The roti themselves were somewhat dense but delicious! However, they tasted so much better with the massaman sauce! It reminded me of curry, and usually I'm not a big fan of curry because it can be overwhelming. However, as a sauce, it was delicious! The massaman sauce even had some potatoes in it, a nice touch to it! The seafood padcha combined shrimp, squid, mussels, and fish with various vegetables in a spicy basil sauce. Definitely hot and spicy, but that didn't stop me from scarfing the food down while making the notorious ""huff huff huff"" noise in an attempt to cool down the chewed up food. My favorite part was the fried fish, but there were only 2 pieces out of the whole dish! The squid was somewhat plain, but the shrimp and mussels made up for the squid. I was somewhat disappointed that half the dish was just vegetables!!The Thai tea, roti, and seafood padcha combined were the perfect size for the two of us! If coming to Peak Thai restaurant, I would recommend getting an appetizer and special to get the most out of your money if you're eating with someone. If we are in the area, I would definitely try a different dish out but would get the roti again!!",0
11707,"Title: A Flavor Fusion Feast at Sup Crab

I recently had the pleasure of dining at Sup Crab, a unique eatery blending Cajun-style seafood with Chinese culinary traditions, embracing a quirky yet delightful fusion concept. Our group of 12 easily secured a reservation for a Wednesday evening. Upon arrival, the restaurant greeted us with an inviting, casual ambiance and promptly seated us at a spacious table.

Among the array of dishes we explored, my dining partner and I indulged in a delectable seafood combo featuring snow crab legs bathed in Ghost Street Sauce, a fiery Sichuan concoction that tantalized our taste buds with its spicy, numbing effect. The combo, generously portioned for two at $99, included succulent shrimp, sausage, potatoes, corn, and crawfish. Every item was infused with the vibrant Ghost Street Sauce, though the shrimp, sausage, and snow crab truly shone, absorbing the flavors marvelously. My only quibble was a slight undercooking of the potatoes, but this did not detract from the overall experience. Accompaniments such as Chongqing popcorn chicken and salted egg yolk Dungeness crab elevated the meal further, with their crisp, spicy, and velvety textures.

The staff's attentiveness added to the charm, especially when they helped us don our bibs for the impending feast. A surprise offering from the owner, a sour fish soup akin to an amplified Tom Yum, showcased the kitchen's prowess with Chinese dishes, providing a tangy counterpoint to the evening's spread.

In sum, Sup Crab stands out as a gem in Chinatown, offering an adventurous twist on the usual fare with its fresh, flavorful dishes and convivial service. Ideal for seafood lovers seeking a dash of excitement, it's a spot not to be missed—just remember to dress down as you prepare to dive into this delicious culinary adventure.",1
2583,"Title: A Sizzling First KBBQ Experience at Samwon Garden

I ventured into the world of Korean BBQ at Samwon Garden, and it was nothing short of thrilling. The energy of the place immediately envelops you with pulsating music and a vibrant atmosphere. The food truly lived up to the hype - the flavors were on point, succulent, and well-seasoned, making for a delightful culinary journey.

Our waiter seemed a bit off their game, lacking in politeness and assistance, but considering the bustling environment and the late hour, it was understandable. The price point was reasonable; our group of four feasted generously and the bill totaled around $200, which felt fair for the abundance and quality of food we enjoyed.

KBBQ at Samwon is a culinary adventure that's hard to get wrong. If you haven't tried it yet, I wholeheartedly recommend diving in. It's an experience that tantalizes the taste buds and energizes the soul.",1
14906,"I had high expectations for the marinated poke at this eatery, hoping for a unique twist on a common dish. Unfortunately, the result was disappointing. Although it's challenging to find genuine Hawaiian poke in NYC, this restaurant didn't come close to an authentic experience. The meal quality was passable, but given the steep price for a large serving, I anticipated a better balance between rice and fish. In the end, the dish didn't justify the expense due to its lack of authenticity and skewed proportions.",1

13196,"Title: Stylish Elevation with a View at Equinox Hotel's Restaurant

If you're on the hunt for a place that’s sure to impress a special someone or show off the city's style to visitors, this trendy restaurant perched high within the Equinox Hotel strikes the perfect note. With sweeping views of the iconic Vessel and a keen eye for modern design, this spot offers a dining experience that is as visually stunning as it is gastronomically innovative.

My latest visit was a sweet endeavor, as I cozied up in the inviting bar/lounge area for dessert. The Chocolate Moon Rocks piqued my curiosity and didn't disappoint, delivering a taste as out-of-this-world as its name suggests. The Mexican Hot Chocolate, however, fell short of remarkable, even with its butter beer ice cream sidekick—a nostalgic nod to Universal Studios that couldn't quite elevate the overall flavor.

Despite the mixed dessert encounter, the restaurant's vibrant atmosphere is worth noting. You'll find guests in chic attire mingling with those in upscale gym gear—an ode to the Equinox ethos of luxury and wellness seamlessly blending together.

Already plotting my return, I have my sights set on the Electric Lemon dessert. Its promise of homemade pop rocks is intriguing, hinting at a playful end to what I anticipate will be another visually and culinarily captivating visit.",1

The typical Korean sides were brought to the table as all-you-can-eat.  Service: Friendly service from initial encounter to the very end.

2762,"I recently revisited a restaurant I first discovered last year, this time to celebrate Valentine's Day 2020, and the experience was just as impressive as my initial visit. The ambiance immediately sets the tone with an elegant chandelier, and the service throughout the evening was friendly and attentive.

Starting with the appetizers, the prawns were notably large, wonderfully seasoned, and thoughtfully peeled, catering to my preference. Both the guacamole and the octopus maintained the high standard, being flavorful and tender.

For the main course, the lamb shank took center stage, accompanied by a satisfying side of soup and fresh vegetables - all of which combined to create a heartwarming entrée.

The cocktail of choice was the 'EZ', a blend that intrigued my taste buds with its unique salt and sugar-rimmed glass, adding a sweet and savory edge to the drink.

A complimentary champagne toast and dessert provided a thoughtful conclusion to a Valentine's meal, underscoring the restaurant's commitment to guest satisfaction. The overall experience was outstanding, cementing this spot high on my list of places to dine. Highly recommended for anyone seeking top-notch food and drink in a welcoming setting.",1
11880,"Title: A Pleasant Surprise at Sylvia's Despite a Rocky Start

My inaugural visit to Sylvia's came with apprehension, stirred by its inconsistent reviews and a family member's qualms about food quality. Though our dining experience kicked off on the wrong foot with a one-hour wait due to an oversight, the attentive bartender swiftly remedied the situation, ensuring our meals arrived promptly once seated.

Despite receiving my plate lukewarm—a personal pet peeve—the food's flavors thoroughly impressed me. The evening's indulgence began with a robust Sangria at the bar, setting a high bar for the meal to follow. Upon seating, we were greeted by a tempting basket of warm cornbread, which did not disappoint. The main event was a shared feast: succulent ribs, crispy fried chicken, tender grilled catfish, perfectly paired with traditional sides of collard greens, black-eyed peas, mac and cheese, and candied yams. Each dish was a delectable testament to Sylvia's culinary prowess.

In short, Sylvia's redeemed itself with outstanding flavors and hearty food, turning initial skepticism into a culinary delight.",1

It's reassuring to see that quality hasn't been compromised with the change of scenery. Highly recommended for those seeking familiar excellence.",1

20095,"Incredible spot for a nouveau Americana dinner, creative cocktails and oftentimes live music. The Ragtrader (upstairs for dining) is decked out with hip decor, from the industrial metal railings to the table seating in the VW hippie camper, and sports a lively atmosphere, while the Bo Peeps (downstairs for drinking and live music) embraces you with a more dim and romantic vibe with live music and shows in the evenings. My friends and I found no difficulty making a reservation for 4 on a Friday for dinner upstairs and drinks downstairs (Boo Peeps reservation line only opens at 5PM, just fyi!). Our dinner started wonderfully as our friendly waiter that brought out my El Guapo, which was a refreshing twist of a margarita drink with the signature sour kick topped with cucumbers and pepper for a soothing aftertaste, one of my favourite cocktails to date!! Our party ordered the Mac N Cheese to share and I had the Ragtrader Cheeseburger and fries after reading some positive reviews. I was blown away by the Mac N Cheese, the Gruyere melted cheese was indulgently creamy with salty tones and the breadcrumbs were baked to perfection, giving each bite an ever so enjoyable crunch. Truth be told, I did not want to share that Mac M Cheese and when I get a chance, I would not share it! The cheeseburger, however, was quite a disappointment compared to the rest. Brought out in a minimalistic fashion, with a simple burger lacking visual suggestions of any vegetable toppings placed on a large chopping block, I was initially puzzled and intrigued. However, biting into the mildly stale sesame bun, I was neither impressed with the flavor of the medium cooked patty, nor appreciative of the tiny portions of lettuce leaves and vestiges of tomato hidden on the underside. The secret sauce boasted on the menu tasted like a weak tartar sauce, personally I'm unsure if it was the strength of the sauce or the sheer lack of quantity of it within this pity of a burger. I decided to finish it quickly, and moved onto the stack of fries that accompanied it, and frankly even enjoyed the fries more than the burger itself. The burger would have kept my review at 3 stars if it were not for the phenomenal experience throughout the rest of the menu.If you've read up to this point of the review, I applaud thee and will like to impart this necessary piece of advice: when making the reservation at Bo Peeps for post-dining drinks/music **ASK ABOUT THE PURCHASE MINIMUM!!** We had pleasantly finished our dining experience, with drinks, upstairs and wandered downstairs to enjoy some dessert and live music only to find there was a mandatory $25 minimum spending fee per person, despite having eaten upstairs. This caught us unexpected as we could have easily come down to Bo Peeps directly and ordered similar menu items (the pizzas and several dining options are the same) to meet the $25 required minimum rather than eating upstairs (although upstairs has the more diverse menu). Next time we return to Ragtraders and Bo Peeps for a weekend evening, we will book only with Bo Peeps to eat, drink and enjoy music all in one cozy setting!",0
17999,"Title: Hidden Gem in Midtown East: A Delightful Lunch at Wokuni

My dining experience at Wokuni for a quick lunch with a friend was a pleasant surprise, nestled among the busy streets of Midtown East. The restaurant's spacious interior provided a comfortable reprieve from the bustling city outside.

We were warmly welcomed by our friendly server, who struck the perfect balance between attentiveness and giving us our space. Starting with the agedashi tofu, we were treated to a traditional Japanese appetizer that was both flavorful and satisfyingly hearty.

Moving on to the main course, my friend's choice of Kaisen-Don—a dish boasting whole pieces of fresh sashimi—was the standout, offering a generous variety of seafood. My Bara Chirasi, while tasty with its mix of egg, caviar, and sashimi, felt less impressive due to the finely diced fish that made the sashimi less noticeable.

Despite this, Wokuni has won me over, and I am eager to return, perhaps to indulge in their famed bluefin tuna. Next time, whether for lunch or dinner, I'll be sure to follow my friend's lead on the menu choices.",1
2645,"Title: Fresh Flavors with Room for Improvement at New Eatery

My boyfriend and I decided to check out a new restaurant during its opening phase and had a mixed yet promising experience. Visiting early in the day granted us a peaceful atmosphere. I ordered the chicken Kalbi tacos, which were an intriguing but ultimately lackluster fusion, the flavors not perfectly mingling with the corn tortilla. My companion's glass noodle dish fell short of his expectations. However, the shared basket of fried chicken was the highlight, tempting enough to warrant a future visit just for another taste. The service added to the positive experience with its pleasantness, and the ample seating means you won't be waiting for a table. We're curious enough about the rest of the menu to return for a second round.",1
2234,"I recently visited a restaurant recommended by a waitress for a unique dinner experience and it didn't disappoint. Despite not having reservations, we were promptly seated upon opening. The atmosphere buzzed with energy as the place filled up throughout the evening.

The happy hour offerings were particularly impressive, with budget-friendly oysters, salmon tartare, lobster rolls, and half-priced bar drinks like the fiery $8 martinis. The oysters, accompanied by various sauces, were the highlight, while the salmon tartare had an unexpected spicy kick that might not appeal to everyone.

The wedge salad was passable, though not extraordinary, with its simple blue cheese and walnut dressing. Moving onto the mains, the restaurant's reputation for seafood had set high expectations, but we ventured to try the steak and pork chop instead. The steak was a high-quality cut, lean and cooked to a perfect medium, but it fell short on flavor until an aioli sauce revived it. On the other hand, the pork chop was a hit - juicy and fresh, even from just a sample.

A delightful surprise ended our meal - a complimentary chocolate dish served with our coffee and cappuccino, a sweet touch by the establishment.

In summary, four stars for decent food and a positive overall experience. Now, it's on to the next culinary adventure!",1
11688,"Title: Hidden Gem for Korean BBQ and Happy Hour Delights

If you find yourself craving Korean BBQ a stone's throw from K-town, this is the spot to hit. It boasts an enticing happy hour with excellent food and drink deals. Unlike the all-you-can-eat establishments, pricing here aligns with Manhattan's standard—but the value is clear once you taste the fare.

A must-try is the JUMULLEOK—marinated prime rib-eye at $36 a plate. It's an incredible mix of tenderness and flavor, perfectly balancing savory and sweet notes. Although the KBBQ isn't self-cook by default—you need to order a minimum of two meat dishes for that—leaving the cooking to the experts in the kitchen might be your best bet.

Don't miss out on the Mars roll, showcasing a fusion of tempura crunch and spicy tuna. The spicy tuna pizza is a crowd-pleaser, and to wash it down, lychee soju offers a refreshing touch.

Would I go back? Absolutely. This place is a solid choice for those after great Korean BBQ without the crowds, coupled with happy hour pleasures.",1

The pork was hot and crispy, the rice paper was thin, and the peanut sauce/some special sauce was flavorful.I had mixed feelings about the flank and brisket soup. Initially, the broth was good. However, the closer I got to the bottom of the bowl the more fishy it became. The noodles were thicker than usual, but I enjoyed it. The meat is where all of the praise goes. The flank and brisket were tender and cooked just right with the temperature of the broth.The bowl was very large which is why we used a black ladle.

17983,"Title: Cheesesteak Heaven at Shorty's!

Review:

I'm a huge fan of Shorty's and it's high time I sang their praises with a review. Their Philly cheesesteaks are the real deal, and I'm constantly amazed by the variety on their menu. Shorty's has an impressive array of 14 different Philly options, including vegan choices to ensure no one misses out on the experience. Talk about having something for everyone!

What sets Shorty's apart is the made-to-order promise, ensuring every bite is as fresh as it is delicious. The chicken and steak Phillys are generously stuffed with a half-pound of meat, guaranteeing a satisfying meal every time. And let's not get started on their sides – from an assortment of fries, including the addictive Italian fries, to their exceptional Yuengling Onion Rings, there's no shortage of perfect accompaniments.

Their catering options are a godsend for office lunches, while the Weekend Brunch and Happy Hour are not-to-miss events. I personally can't get enough of their sirloin cheesesteaks with onions and mild provolone – it's my go-to order, and my partner loves a bit of added heat with peppers on his.

Another crowning glory has to be their bread, shipped straight from Philly and baked fresh on-site. This commitment to authenticity really shows in the quality of their sandwiches.

Shorty's truly manages to bring a slice of Philly to every bite, with the perfect combination of thinly sliced sirloin steaks, choice of cheeses, and heavenly soft hoagie rolls. Even when taking out, a quick oven reheat brings back all the crispy goodness.

In summary, if you're after a Philly cheesesteak that will transport you straight to the City of Brotherly Love, Shorty's is the spot. Trust me, you'll be in cheesesteak heaven just like me!",1
15930,"Title: Authentic Thai Delight at Kare Thai

I've sampled Thai cuisine around the neighborhood, and Kare Thai, alongside Obao, towers as a top contender for the best Thai food I've experienced in ages. During the quarantine, I've made it a point to support local eateries and satisfy my Thai food cravings, so I placed an order at Kare Thai.

My order included two servings of spring rolls, chicken pad thai, and Thai fried rice with chicken. Generosity flowed from the kitchen to my doorstep—$11 tip well-deserved—as the food arrived not only on time but also steaming hot. The standout feature of both main dishes was their lack of greasiness, a common pitfall in lesser establishments.

The delivery service was exceptional, with the driver going the extra mile to bring the meal right to our door. And the portions were remarkably generous, exceeding any takeout quantity I've encountered before.

As for the taste, it was an absolute hit! My dad savored his Thai fried rice with gusto, leaving not a single grain behind—and it all disappeared before I could even capture a snapshot of his meal. As for me, the satiation was so complete that I doubt I'll need another meal for the day.

Kare Thai has unquestionably won over a new loyal customer, and I'm already looking forward to our next indulgent Thai feast.",1
18949,"Title: A Delightful Evening with Authentic Indian Flavors

I recently dined at a local Indian restaurant in search of some quality Indian cuisine, and I was not disappointed. Upon arrival, despite the bustling dining room, I was pleased to find a comfortable table in the cozy, albeit narrow, space. The staff's efficiency was immediately apparent, providing us with menus and water post-haste. It was a minor letdown that my Sprite came in a can, signaling no refills, but this was easily overlooked as the evening progressed.

My go-to dish at any Indian restaurant is the Chicken Tikka Masala, and this establishment's rendition was nothing short of exceptional. The darker hue of the masala sauce hinted at a depth of flavor that was rich and immensely satisfying, while the chicken was seasoned and cooked to perfection. Accompanied by Garlic Naan, which was delightfully crisp and flavored just right, the meal was elevated to a new level of enjoyment.

Dessert was an unexpected treat—frozen orange cremes served in their natural peel—a refreshing end to what was a truly satisfying meal. When it came to value, I was impressed with the balance of price, quality, and quantity. The attentive customer service further enhanced the dining experience, adding a personal touch to an already fantastic evening.

In conclusion, this restaurant is a gem for anyone in search of authentic Indian flavors, friendly service, and excellent value. I will certainly be returning. Cheers!",1
10732,"Title: A Slice of New York Deli Elegance

Upon entering this bustling New York deli, it's immediately apparent that it's a hotspot for the city's privileged professionals. The staff, confident in their hustle, might give the impression of ignoring newcomers – don't be taken aback if they start your order without a formal acknowledgment.

The ordering process is straightforward – select your meal at the back and settle the bill at the counter. The deli prides itself on cleanliness and bright lighting, providing a welcoming atmosphere for a quick bite or leisurely lunch.

I opted for a sandwich and was not only impressed by its quality but also the meticulous care in its wrapping – a testament to the deli's attention to detail. However, a word to the wise: scrutinize the price tags. Unlabeled items can carry a hefty premium, as discovered with a $2.99 fage strawberry yogurt.

Overall, my purchase of three items, including said yogurt, totaled around $13 – reasonable for the quality and experience, though always be wary of those unlabeled extras. A recommendable spot for a sharp service and satisfying fare, just keep an eye on the prices!",1

My friend and I had an exceptional brunch at this bustling spot, where the Yelp waitlist feature proved its worth. Arriving on a busy Saturday morning to a 90-minute wait, we were promptly seated at our reservation time—efficiency at its best.

Our waiter’s kindness and upbeat energy set a positive tone for the meal. We began with the Yuzu Cocktail, a delightfully refreshing choice reminiscent of zesty lemonade. The Salmon Salad was a culinary highlight; each mouthful combined perfectly cooked salmon with the zing of pickled beets and carrots, all harmonized by a superb dressing. It's a contender for the best salad I've ever savored.

The Mushroom Toast, while tasty, presented a minor challenge to cut and left behind a potent truffle aftertaste. To round off our meal, we ordered oat milk lattes to go, which proved to be a splendid choice.

This place is on my must-visit list for future trips to town. Perfect for those seeking a delectable brunch with attentive service—just don't forget to plan ahead with the Yelp waitlist!",1

16909,"Nestled amidst the hustle and bustle of St. Mark's, this eatery boasts an appealing interior and thoughtfully arranged seating, a true oasis in the chaotic surroundings. Upon visiting with a party of three, our dining experience was, regrettably, a mixed bag.

We started with the hanging pork belly, which earned a respectable 7/10, primarily due to its sauce—a faint glimmer of the dish's potential. However, it was the Mapo Tofu that captivated my palate, earning a 9/10. Straying from tradition, it offered a delicate balance of spice and the silken texture of tofu—a highlight of our meal.

The spicy fish fillet was commendable, scoring an 8/10. The fish was cooked well, yet it was overshadowed by an overwhelming onslaught of spice that left little room for other flavors to shine. The chicken dish, however, was a letdown at 6/10, dominated by an overzealous portion of peppers, relegating the chicken to an elusive treasure hidden beneath.

In summary, while the ambiance is a draw, the food fails to make a lasting impression. It's a place I might revisit only if someone's desire to dine here was insistent.",1

Amidst the bustling excitement of Restaurant Week NYC, Bobby Van's provided an exceptional dining experience for my daughter's birthday celebration. Upon entering, I was immediately transported back to a time where hospitality reigned supreme, evidenced by the attentiveness and friendliness of the staff who remained standing, exuding respect and warmth.

The interior of the restaurant was arresting, with a magnificent, vintage wood bar commanding the space. Our culinary journey commenced with a delightful assortment of fresh bread — sesame, pumpernickel, focaccia, and crackers, which we promptly devoured. My first course was a delectable beet and barley salad, punctuated with mandarin oranges and a dressing to remember, while the Caesar salad impressed with its generous portion and tastiness.

The main dishes continued to elevate our experience. My daughter enjoyed a succulent New York Strip alongside perfectly cooked vegetables and fries, while I savored a flawless cod entrée. The fish was impeccably breaded and accompanied by an extraordinary citrus sauce that truly set it apart, paired with the finest arugula I've ever tasted.

Despite being pleasantly sated to the point of skipping dessert, the entire meal remained etched in my memory, not least because of our cordial waiter who balanced attentiveness with a welcomed subtlety.

The Tom Yum noodle soup was good, not very spicy but it was still good. It had a very homey feel to it. The papaya salad was good, nice and crunchy. Not too spicy with this either, but it was good. The service was also good. Summary: overall it's not bad, will probably stop by again in the future maybe.",0
11217,"I know that this place has been hyped up for an incredibly long time, so maybe that's why I had extremely high expectations when I walked in. The ramen was great, for sure, and the wait was smooth and faster than expected, but it wasn't mindblowing. The OG pork buns were honestly the best part of my meal. The sauce was perfect and the buns were light and fluffy. The pork ramen wasn't as spicy as I had hoped, and there was only one fatty piece of pork. It was good nonetheless, but I felt like as if something was missing. The soup itself was honestly a little bland and too oily for me. The noodles were chewy, but maybe I just had high hopes coming in. Overall not a bad experience, the service was great and the food was moderately good.",0
17644,"Title: A Spirited Brunch at Dutch's

I recently visited Dutch's for their notorious bottomless drink special, featuring the deceptively potent Dutch's Punch. True to its reputation, the punch tastes innocuously like a refreshing blend of grapefruit juice and lemonade, but don't let it fool you—as I learned, it packs a swift punch indeed.

As for the food, it was a hit with a minor hiccup. The breakfast tacos initially missed the mark but were promptly replaced with a delightful serving of Huevos Rancheros, which quickly rose to the top of my favorites list. The french toast and chicken and waffles also deserve a hearty mention—both were indulgent and satisfying.

While the bill might give you a moment of pause, as it eagerly nibbles away at your vacation funds, the overall experience at Dutch's is one to be savored. Just make sure to plan a leisurely stroll after your meal, perhaps to nearby Central Park, to balance out the indulgence. Dutch's is a spot where the enjoyment is worth the splurge, and the memories, like the punch, sneak up on you—in the best way possible.",1
10081,"Title: A Consistent Culinary Delight

This gem of a restaurant is a testament to consistency and culinary excellence. Having dined here on multiple occasions, I can attest to the unwavering quality of their food. The scallion pancake with sliced beef is a standout dish - it's a flavor-packed choice that leaves you yearning for more with each visit.

For those in a quandary over other options, the noodles and wontons are equally satisfying, sharing a harmonious taste profile. The handmade noodles deserve a special mention for their delightful chewiness and freshness, a real treat for those who appreciate authentic culinary craftsmanship.

On a wintry New York City day, these dishes prove to be the ultimate comfort food. I wholeheartedly recommend this establishment to anyone looking for a consistently delicious dining experience.",1
16527,"I was intrigued to see what this place had to offer when I walked by before it opened. I was excited to see something new on the block and to try a different place for lunch.I had too high expectations. The food is good--nothing wrong there. But it's nothing special either. I'm a huge fan of Mulberry & Vine, but this is pretty much the same thing. I might not have read into the story as in depth, but the food is pretty much the same.I got the lemon herbed chicken bowl with the paprika broccoli and vegan mash. Worth a try though!",0
18750,"Title: Festive Feast at Ritz

I visited Ritz on Christmas Day, fully expecting the holiday hustle. To my delight, we were seated immediately, and the bustling atmosphere couldn't dampen the warm welcome. Perusing the menu, anticipation built, though patience was required as the food took its time arriving amidst the crowd. 

When our meals arrived, mine was a steaming success—utterly delicious and just the right temperature. Unfortunately, one of my companions received a less than warm dish, likely due to a kitchen mix-up with the order of preparation. On a day as busy as Christmas, such mishaps are understandable.

One point of menu clarity: ""Bacon & Sausage"" listed as side options with pancakes might imply a combo rather than a choice. A switch to ""Bacon OR Sausage"" could clear up any confusion. 

Regardless, my experience was overwhelmingly positive. Ritz remains a beloved spot for holiday dining, and my appreciation for their efforts on such a demanding day remains undiminished. Thank you, Ritz, for a memorable Christmas meal!",1

The moment we arrived, our reservation ensured we were seated immediately, with no wait time.

19782,"Beautiful restaurant, a super eclectic range of options for environments. I love the concept of the Latin-Asian fusion, however the dishes are super hit or super miss. The Thai chicken empanadas are probably one of my favorites, but the Japanese chicken meatballs were hard, lukewarm at best, undercooked and salty. Portion sizes are a bit on the light side. Service is not overly attentive or helpful, normally have to flag down waitstaff when here. At the end of the day it's great ambiance, but is overpriced and the food can be hit or miss. I'll continue coming back here but it has room to improve.",0
14288,"Title: Cozy West Village Eatery with Room for Improvement - 3.5/5

Last Saturday night, my curiosity about this often-walked-by restaurant was finally satiated. With a reservation, my friends and I settled into the charming ambiance, appreciating the option to dine al fresco. The standout was the wine selection – excellent and robust.

We started with the tuna tartare – a decent, if not memorable, choice. My rigatoni was a toothsome affair, with just the right amount of chew and a well-rounded sauce, albeit with a price tag that seemed a touch inflated. My dining companions enjoyed their fish entrees and the portions did not disappoint across the board. The side of brussels sprouts also met our expectations.

The interior exuded elegance, yet the music volume, more suited to a bar scene, could overshadow conversation, especially on a bustling Saturday night. For those seeking a quieter dining experience, this might not be the spot.

Service was a mixed bag. While our waitress was pleasant and prompt, accuracy was not her strong suit – think unordered salmon dishes making an appearance and overlooked dish adjustments. A billing error did not help matters, though it was resolved amicably.

In conclusion, while this restaurant offers a dependable option for catching up with friends over a meal, some aspects of the service and pricing could use a tune-up to truly shine.",1
1967,"Veselka has been on my radar way before it made a cameo in Ocean's 8. I finally got the chance to try it. I came in with two friends on a Wednesday at around 6 and it was busy, but not too packed yet. There were so many things on the menu that I wanted to try but I decided on the Deluxe Meat Plate (1 meat, 1 potato, 1 sauerkraut and mushroom pierogi, 1 meat stuffed cabbage with mushroom gravy, grilled kielbasa, side of sour cream & beet horseradish salad) since it had a little bit of everything. The platter also comes with a small soup, which you can pick. I went with the Ukranian Borscht and it did not disappoint. I had never had borscht before but I do like beets, and it was a good way to start the meal. As for the pierogis, these weren't the ones I would have picked if I was ordering a la carte. I thought they were only okay. The filling was a bit underwhelming. Maybe they would have tasted better fried? The kielbasa was good but the star of the show was the stuffed cabbage. Meat/rice/mushroom gravy - what's not to love? I definitely want to go back to try the potato pancakes, Ukranian meatballs, and the blintzes, so I'll be back!Tip - try to avoid the bathroom if you can. It's pretty gross in there - not sure if they clean it.",0

10074,"Title: A Thai Delight to Remember

I recently dined at this charming little Thai gem and was utterly impressed by the authentic flavors that danced across my palate. The Pad Kee Moa, brimming with succulent seafood and a delightful charred texture, instantly became a favorite, so much so that we couldn't resist ordering an extra one to-go. The Tom Yum Fried Rice was nothing short of divine, bursting with the exotic tang of tom yum.

For dessert, the Khanom Tuay was a showstopper – delicate steamed coconut pudding that arrived fresh and steaming, its creamy coconut milk layer a perfect end to our feast.

With just 20 seats, reservations are a must – our group of six was comfortably accommodated thanks to a quick phone call. The service was impeccable, with our server constantly on the ball, offering fresh chili, lime, and keeping our glasses full.

The personal touch of Glur, the owner, is evident throughout – from the ingeniously designed restaurant sign to the authentic Thai dinnerware. It's clear that love goes into every detail here.

I am already planning my next visit to relive the culinary journey. Highly recommended for aficionados of Thai cuisine!",1
20302,"Came here for a birthday dinner. Staff was super friendly and helpful especially in recommending dishes for the table. We had some folks who were first time diners to Indian cuisine and some folks who cannot eat spicy foods. The menu is vast and the waiter recommended an abundance of chicken dishes that were prepared differently. To start, the table enjoyed the chicken tandoori platter, lasuni gobhi (crispy cauliflower), and Bhel puri (crispy rice mixture with tamarind).The favorites for the table were the chicken tikka masala and the garlic naan. I tried the fish (sea bass) tandoori which l had a burnt taste I did not enjoy. Desserts surprisingly were very good. We had the rasamalai and the paan ice cream. These alone are worth a repeat visit.",0
10236,"Title: ""Decent Comfort Food, But Not Quite Worth the Hype""

My recent visit to this mac and cheese spot was a mixed bag. Despite the cozy and perhaps too snug location with a bit of a wait—which might be chalked up to a busy evening—the service was commendable; the young lady at the register exuded friendliness.

The menu promised a cheesy indulgence with a variety of mac and cheese options. Between my coworkers and me, we sampled three types: Cheeseburger Mac, Four Cheese with Bacon, and an Original Mac with added Chicken and Bacon.

While my Cheeseburger Mac was decent, with flavorful noodles and the right amount of cheese, it fell short as the burger element was lost amidst the creamy pasta. On the other hand, the Original Mac embellished with chicken and bacon hit the mark. The flavors were well-balanced and the added proteins complemented the classic dish beautifully.

In all fairness, the food was good but didn't quite justify the price point. If you're in the area and craving some cheesy comfort, it might be worth a try—just don't expect to be blown away for what you're paying.",1
11945,"Damn. These hand rolls are really good. My friend and I came here around 5 o'clock, before it got really packed, We are able to get seats right away.We each ended up getting three rolls; cucumber, crab and tuna. The rice in the rolls are warm, so it makes the bite even better. The ingredients are fresh and you can taste it in the food. The ginger is fantastic and adding it to the roll makes it so much better.Towards the end, we were really tempted to get one more roll, So we ended up splitting a shrimp roll, which was fantastic ! Everything was so well flavored and simple.The service was pretty great, they were patient and explained how the Menu works and gave us recommendations. The only downside is that once you're done eating you need to go lol. The line can get long after  5pm , so I get it.I will definitely be coming back!",0
12336,"Let's face it: you don't come here for the service or a clean dining experience. You strictly come here for the food.My all-time favorite dish is the pan fried pork chop noodles with knife cut noodles. The soups are also good, but the noodles in this dish are extra chewy and flavorful. It's the Chinese rival to Piccola Cucina Osteria Siciliana (a fabulous Italian joint on Spring Street that serves handmade noodles). You can also get a massive meal for a small price--but remember that this is a cash-only establishment! Come prepared.",0
12779,"Came here on a Friday night with my partner during happy hour. We tried each of the tacos with the exception of the brussel sprouts taco. Each taco had a unique flavor, were hot, and so tasty. During happy hour each taco listed on the menu is $5. My personal favorite was the duck taco. This place can get crowded and cramped really fast, so I wouldn't suggest this place for large groups. I tried the pear and the porque no margarita, which were $9 each during happy hour. They were both tasty.

Sometimes they come out crispy and delicious but the last two times they have come out soggy and not worth the calories.

18792,"Title: A Classy Take on Korean BBQ

I recently visited a Korean BBQ spot that truly prioritizes quality over quantity, making a refreshing change from the all-you-can-eat establishments I'm accustomed to. This contemporary restaurant creates a classy atmosphere that is ideal for those who appreciate fine dining experiences.

Our work outing brought me here and though I didn't have the liberty to choose the menu items myself, the selection did not disappoint. The meats were of noticeably high quality, cooked to perfection, and savored by the entire group. Additionally, the restaurant is well-ventilated, a thoughtful touch that ensured we left without the typical BBQ scent on our clothing.

The service was efficient and subtle, keeping our experience smooth without being overly familiar. As for the finale, the desserts were not only delicious but also a treat for the eyes, presented with an artistic flair.

This may not be the go-to place for those with hearty appetites, but it's certainly the perfect venue for a relaxed and elegant girls' night out. I look forward to my next visit where I can dive deeper into the menu and perhaps experience more of their delightful offerings.",1
18321,"Title: Hidden Gem with Culinary Surprises

Upon entering this charming restaurant, I immediately noticed that the space is deceptively large, a pleasant surprise ensuring plenty of seating beyond the kitchen area. Despite arriving ahead of my reservation time due to hunger pangs, fortune favored us with a table becoming available just minutes after our arrival—allowing us to transition seamlessly from the bar to a more comfortable dining spot.

The satay shrimp appetizer was a revelation; a magical skewer of flavor that was, without exaggeration, the highlight of my culinary month. Following this act was a challenge, but the fried calamari rose to it with its airy texture and non-greasy touch. Though I'm not typically a fan of duck, a sample from my friend's plate won me over.

My main course of coconut curry fried chicken was an adventurous blending of flavors, though admittedly it didn't reach the lofty heights set by the shrimp. Nonetheless, the overall dining experience was excellent—combining a lively yet conversation-friendly atmosphere with outstanding service. The staff's attention to detail—including prompt table clearing and fresh cutlery after every course—was a testament to their passion and commitment to the guest experience. Highly recommended for a night out where service and satisfaction are clearly at the heart of the establishment.",1

Imagine getting a hearty serving of 8 dumplings for just $4 – it's a challenge to find such a bargain! The language barrier is negligible given the minimalistic menu; a few simple gestures were all it took to place my order.

I indulged in the dry minced pork with noodles for $7 and both boiled and fried dumplings for $4 each. The quality and flavors were remarkable, particularly considering the price point. For an enhanced dining experience, take my advice: combine black vinegar with chili oil for a divine dumpling dip. If anyone knows where I can find such affordable and delicious fare in San Francisco, slide into my DMs – I'm all ears!",1

I enjoyed every bite, it definitely felt like comfort food. (Side note: turkey meatballs? Definitely more enjoyable than regular old turkey.) i asked for a little cranberry sauce on the side, which I'll admit was disappointingly sweet.

I ventured out for a quick meal on a bustling Saturday and stumbled upon a rather inconspicuous eatery tucked behind a vibrant fruit stand. The crowd-favorite wonton soup and peanut noodles, as per Yelp's acclaim, did not disappoint. Served steaming hot and with impressive speed, these dishes captivated my palate, especially the wonton noodles with their delightfully silky texture that seemed to dissolve delightfully in my mouth.

Seizing the opportunity for a later treat, I ordered an additional serving of peanut noodles and fried chive rings to go. The thoughtful staff prepared these close to my departure, ensuring they remained fresh for enjoyment at home. To my delight, the entire scrumptious experience cost less than a tenner—a true bargain for such high-quality fare. This unassuming spot has certainly earned a return visit.",1

If you are in a dilemma over what pasta to choose, you can't go wrong with the pappardelle bolognese at this gem of a spot. It's a dish that might just redefine your pasta standards—truly one of the best I've ever savored. The bucatini alla carbonara also hits the spot with its perfect al dente texture. While both dishes are exceptional, the pappardelle takes the crown with its fork-tender meat and rich red sauce. As a self-proclaimed Italian pasta aficionado, I assure you that the search for that impeccable bite of al dente ends here. Indulge in either of these options and prepare to be wowed.",1
17089,"I'm Indonesian and this my expectations/standards for Wayan were quite high, and I also understand that it isn't meant to be a traditional Indonesian restaurant but instead a modern, upscale, Westernized take on the cuisine -- and coming from a Vongerichten, infused with European influence. And that is exactly what Wayan delivers. I wouldn't take my Indonesian dad here because he'd be scandalized by seeing a dish of 29¢ Indomie scattered with a few pieces of lobster going for $29, and also because I have found that my parentals can't really grasp hipster restaurants like this. But I urge you all to read Hannah Goldfield's terrific review of Wayan in the New Yorker, because she's best captured the strengths and weaknesses of the menu (though I did like Pete Wells' description of this genre of ""Asian Party Temple restaurant,"" because YES that is exactly what this is), and urged the reader to try the authentic versions of Wayan's dishes at Awang Kitchen and Indo Java in Elmhurst. Don't come to Wayan for your first experience of Indonesian food -- would you go to Olive Garden for your first Italian food taste?Anyway, on to the restaurant. It's quite charmingly decorated in a very ""welcome to Bali!!"" aesthetic, and the servers all wear cool black t-shirts with a batik sleeve. I wouldn't say that most of them are familiar with Indonesian food at all, but I wouldn't really expect so given the location/clientele, and they are all well-trained, attentive and polite. Cocktail menu is excellent, with delicious infusions of Indonesian ingredients into familiar spirits. You can't go wrong with any of these, and I'd probably recommend cocktails over the (still well-curated!) wine list. Finally, the food. We skipped the satay after reading about their inconsistency, and didn't miss them. Everyone orders the Avocado Gado Gado, and it's very good -- just don't expect it to be *anything* like a traditional gado gado. Think of it as being ""gado gado inspired,"" and you'll enjoy it as a savory, creamy, light salad with excellent green dressing. The Javanese Oxtail Soup (their take on sop buntut) is on the appetizer menu but could also serve as a small entrée, with its large hunks of meat-on-the-bone, and it's quite good, especially with the green sambal that accompanies it. We got the side of Corn Fritters (or as I know them, perkedel jagung) as an appetizer, which I'd also recommend, though weirdly I found these much heavier/greasier than their authentic version, though still quite delicious and heavily dosed with makrut lime leaf. I feel that they could have added some sort of acidic sauce to go with these. The aforementioned Lobster Noodles are SO GOOD and are generously lobstered. These actually taste pretty authentic except for the lobster (which isn't really an Indonesian staple) and the butter, and the noodles are juuuust like the mie goreng you'd find at a roadside warung for less than $1. That's not a knock, though -- this was probably my favorite of the savory items. Skip the Nasi Goreng side; the rice is gluey and this misses the wok-hei flavor that I think is the whole point of this famously Indonesian fried rice dish. DO, however, get the Pandan Custard dessert, which is generously infused with a vein of vanilla bean and smothered in deliciously tart passionfruit fruit goop. I would come back just to eat this dessert, truly, though I also read great things about the caramelized banana sundae and the fruit tray. I appreciate that they veered completely away from Indonesian desserts (the fruit tray is a version of rujak, which I regard as a beloved childhood party treat) and decided to let the pastry chef get creative -- these are really nice riffs on traditional flavors. All in all, I think I'd rather go to Awang Kitchen or the monthly Indonesian food bazaars (held at St. James Church in Elmhurst, or better yet at the Masjid Al-Hikmah in Astoria) for my Indonesian fix, but I'm glad that Wayan is introducing the complexity of Indonesian food flavors to Manhattanites. I hope y'all make it out to Queens someday!",0

The price was incredibly reasonable for the quality and variety we enjoyed. The menu featured an array of Asian fusion dishes, each plate more tempting than the last. Standouts included the perfectly prepared potatoes and the salmon egg Benedict, which were both exceptionally flavorful and can only be described as the bomb!

After finally visiting this much-anticipated New York haven of Lyonnaise cuisine, I can affirm that the food is nothing short of exquisite. The traditional French fare, a nostalgic tribute in France, is revitalized within these walls. Each dish we tried radiated with flavor, particularly the quenelle de brochet, crepinette, and rabbit—all Michelin-recommended and deserving of their accolades.

The dining experience is elevated by an attentive and knowledgeable staff, making our time here undeniably lovely. However, I feel compelled to reserve that coveted fifth star, as my visit was slightly marred by a somewhat ambiguous menu. The subtlety of the pre-fixe option eluded me until it was too late, an oversight I hope isn't solely my own. While the server was courteous, a more engaging conversation regarding the restaurant's specialties and recommendations would have been appreciated.

Despite this, I'm eager to return and explore the plethora of tantalizing dishes that I have yet to experience. The buzz around their lunch set has piqued my interest, and perhaps a rare free day will draw me back to indulge once more. This establishment is a must-visit for those who appreciate the enduring charm of French gastronomy.",1
14743,"Title: Service Left Much to Desire, Food a Saving Grace

My recent experience at the restaurant was marred by the service which was both unfriendly and slow, dampening the overall dining atmosphere. Despite the bustling crowd, it was hard not to notice the disparity in service as our waitress was noticeably more amicable towards another table, which did little to lighten the mood.

On a brighter note, the culinary offerings partially redeemed the evening. The Brown Butter Gnocchi with tender braised lamb, complemented by a sprinkle of hazelnuts and a melt of cheese, delivered on flavor with its rich, well-executed sauce. The Salmon Tartare was another highlight, offering a fresh and satisfying dish.

The coffee served was simply passable, not leaving much of an impression. However, the restaurant's cleanliness did stand out, which was appreciated amidst the busy setting.

In sum, while the food had moments of delight, the lacklustre service unfortunately overshadowed an otherwise enjoyable meal.",1

I usually only drop a review when a place is a major letdown or absolutely stellar, and folks, this experience was off-the-charts incredible. Last night's date took me to this gem where we snagged a cozy table in the bar area. Phillip, our server, was an absolute savant with the menu—his descriptions were so appetizing, they had my stomach rumbling before I could even order.

My date opted for the slow-cooked halibut, which was divine. As for me, I indulged in the toasted short rib with horseradish gremolata and potato purée. It's their signature dish for a crystal-clear reason; it was transcendental! Each morsel was a taste of euphoria, seriously rivaling some of life's greatest pleasures.

The ambiance and service were top-notch, huge shoutout to Phillip! I'm definitely planning a revisit, although with a different plus-one (no sparks with the date). If you're in the mood for a culinary flight to paradise, this is your ticket. See you soon! LOL!",1

This spot stands out by offering unconventional toppings like shrimp and eel alongside the nostalgic classics. Despite the twists, the familiar comfort of the dish remains intact.

My usual picks, the pork belly and Chinese sausage, did not disappoint. Space-wise, this venue is an upgrade with more seating and the welcome addition of noodle dishes to the menu.

Last weekend, my family and I decided to check out a local Korean eatery that's been on our radar. While this establishment boasts a vast menu that eclipses many of its rivals in Koreatown, be prepared to pay a little extra for the culinary experience.

We sampled their cold noodles and Budae Jjigae, both of which were satisfying and met our expectations for traditional Korean flavors. However, the Soon Du Bu Jjigae didn't quite hit the mark when compared to the version served at BCD's, especially given the steeper price tag.

Despite this, I'm intrigued enough by the variety of options available that I'd consider a second visit to explore more of what they have to offer. If variety is what you're after and you don't mind spending a bit more, this spot might just be worth your while.",1
14318,"Delicious! The miso ramen was great and tasty!!! Service is quick and friendly, and the restaurant is cozy and local. Really well priced and would recommend to anyone in the neighborhood who wants to support a local small business! I will definitely be back to try some of the Tibetan food!! The Tibetan momo (beef dumplings) looked especially good! They have a great menu with a lot of Tibetan food.",0
221,"I went here with my wife for date night. It is an expensive top quality steak house. Honestly I wasn't sure whether to give it 4 or 5 stars. It was expensive for me and although the food was very good,it didn't knock my socks off or make it to the top of my expensive restaurant or even steakhouse ranking lists (fyi The Boucherie still takes top billing as the best Filet). In the end, really the whole experience was on point and there was no aspect that was bad (except for being pricey...but hey that's what it is). But I could not give 5 stars to a place that I'm likely not going to go back to for a while at least.  ATMOSPHERE- The atmosphere is elegant and masculine kinda like a well decorated man cave. I say that because heaven furniture, sharp angles and trophy heads from hunting. It was noisy though. SERVICE- We had a fantastic waiter, George who was a great balance of non-intrusive yet attentive. All the waiters ask if you are in hurry or have a deadline to go to a show or whatever which is very considerate. FOOD- As stated before, there was really no issues with the food. I shared the filet and the dry aged New York strip with my wife. Both were good but I prefer the Filet but that's just probably based on personal preference.they were both cooked perfectly. What probably prevented them from being one of my top steaks was that the steaks weren't as thick as I would have liked.PRICE/VALUE- good to great quality and great service...but it come at a high price. It is a positive experience and you won't be disappointed if you come here.  Glad I tried it but will move on to other places in NYC.",0
12978,"First time visiting Klong and that being said I will definitely revisit. Cheap affordable happy hour , 3 dollar margaritas, wine and mimosas. I'm not a big drinker : but I did order a strawberry mojito. It was a little to strong , and my stomach can't withhold bottom shelf liquor anymore. But if you're into cheap liquor you will definitely get your money worth's. But let's talk about the food , the chicken wings I was little scared to order. However the wings were delicious and fried to perfection. A little spicy but not overwhelming. I usually take pictures of my food , but it would  be rude of me to post chicken bones. Also I tried the basil chicken fried rice and hmmmmm was it good. Honestly don't know what was better the wings or the rice. The rice was freshly prepared. The staff at Klong are supportive attentive and friendly. The wait time for beverages a little delayed but that didn't take away from my experience. It looks like the establishment is typical packed on a regular base ; in which it would be ideal to hire more waiters. Due to limit staff ; it's best to bring cash unless you don't mind waiting.",0

11761,"I recently stumbled upon a gem of a Thai restaurant conveniently located near my office, and I must say, their Pad See Ew has truly impressed me. Being quite discerning about this dish, due to my fond memories of a Thai spot in Hackensack, NJ, I was delighted to find that this place nails the authentic flavors I've been craving. However, I feel compelled to deduct a star as their summer roll didn't quite hit the mark. Despite that, it’s a solid four-star experience for anyone in search of quality Thai cuisine.",1
10347,"OK tacos, but definitely overly priced for what you can find outside of Manhattan.For as long as I can remember, this taco food truck has been parked on the edge of Whitehall and Water Street on weekdays. During prime lunch time, there is usually a steady stream of traffic, but not a whole lot. This is probably due to the fact that there is a Dos Toros Taqueria across the street and a Chipotle at 1 New York Plaza. With that said, I ordered 2 tacos during my 1st visit, 1 Steak and 1 Barbacoa. Each taco is $3.50 each, unless you order a shrimp or fish taco, which is a bit pricier.The 2 tacos were a decent size and had a fair amount of meat, but for $1-$2 less in the outerboroughs, I can get the same thing. As for incredients, other than the meat, they both had a spoonful of guacamole in them, along with a small amount of onions and just 2-3 slices of radish. Flavorwise, they were OK. They weren't bad, but because I paid $3.50 each for them, I probably didn't feel satisfied. To be honest, it was better than I thought it would be though. Also, it's probably one of the few ""authentic"" tasting taco places in the area because everyone knows Chipotle and Dos Toros are ""Americanized"" chains and there aren't any other taco trucks nearby.",0
16541,"Tucked behind a facade that whispers of classic American fare, this gem of a restaurant serves up authentic, scrumptious Mediterranean cuisine with the cozy ambiance of a stateside cafe/diner. Patience is a virtue here as the food takes its time to arrive, but rest assured, the wait is worth it. My dining adventure began with the Spicy Green Shakshuka, an innovative take on the classic dish featuring a harmonious blend of citrus and spice, with a generous serving of pita, striking the perfect balance for scooping up the flavorful combination of tomatoes and eggs. Meanwhile, my companion’s choice of simple, yet supremely fluffy pancakes left us both impressed. The allure of Israeli culinary delights beckons for future visits, as both the menu and the dishes gracing nearby tables promise a feast for the senses. This dine-in experience is a must for those eager to explore rich Mediterranean tastes in a space reminiscent of American comfort.",1
12217,"Title: Mixed Feelings at a Trendy NYC Truffle Spot

I recently visited a much-hyped restaurant in NYC on a Friday night, eager to try truffles for the first time, a delicacy my local friend highly recommended. We made reservations and arrived at 5pm to a nearly empty venue, promptly escorted to our table.

Upon settling in, a lady who I recognized as the co-owner from the restaurant's website introduced us to the daily special. The service seemed brisk, and her demeanor somewhat impatient, which set a less-than-welcoming tone for the evening.

Our orders included two servings of the squid ink pasta and a truffle-topped burger. The pasta, with its perfect cook and fresh taste, did justice to my first truffle experience, although I wasn't overwhelmingly impressed by the truffle itself. The accompanying shrimp was underwhelming, reminiscent of a basic supermarket find.

While the lady's service was lacking in warmth, the male co-owner presented a friendlier face, offering smiles that somewhat redeemed our encounter.

In summary, while the food had its high points, particularly the fresh pasta, the service left a bit to be desired, with a tangible air of expectation to order more. It's a place I might recommend to truffle enthusiasts, but with a caveat regarding the potential for a mixed service experience.",1
17717,"Came on a Friday after work. I found this restaurant on Facebook about 2 months ago and bookmarked it.  This is a great place. Excellent customer service. The mixologist Persuad was AWESOME!!! His drinks were amazing. Very yummy and mixed well. The owner/manager extremely friendly and attentive to all guests. Loved the ambiance and the decorum.  I only ordered an appetizer the Habanero Tikka but that alone made be do a happy food dance. Very, very good. I definitely will be back but I will indulge in a full meal. I highly recommend anyone stopping by for drinks or dinner",0
14020,"I ordered a healthy spinach wrap in the morning. Quite a lot of people getting breakfast at 9am but luckily I used ritual to pre order and it's ready for me when I got there.The wrap is a tiny bit smaller than I've expected (I expect for this price it's more like the size of a burrito). I like that they have some foil to keep it warm. The ingredient combination was light and refreshing, perfect for breakfast. It has turkey Swiss cheese egg white avocado. If the portion can be bigger it would have been perfect.",0
13316,"Title: Mixed Feelings but Worth a Visit

Rating: 3.5/5

Visited this bustling spot on a Saturday evening and it's clear reservations are a must. I opted for the salmon with cream sauce, which boasted generous portions and perfectly cooked pasta, though the sauce lacked the punch I hoped for. A sprinkle of salt and pepper provided a quick fix. My partner's choice, penne with meatballs, stole the show with its authentic Italian tomato sauce and precise al dente texture – I found myself envious of his plate. The complimentary bread was a welcome starter, fresh and satisfyingly simple. While my experience was just satisfactory, the love he had for his meal guarantees our return. Good for those seeking hearty Italian fare, but the seasoning might need a personal touch.",1
227,"I came here for Valentine's Day and it was fantastic. They had a pre-fixe menu for $85 which was very reasonable. Normally there's only about three options for each course on a pre-fixe but they had so many options! We got the meze platter and the phyllo rolls with beef for appetizers. Both were amazing! The meze platter is huge and had six different dips. The spicy red pepper, hummus and babaganoush were the standout. For entree I got the seafood dish with shrimp and octopus on top of a creamy eggplant- it was soo good. My bf got one of the lamb kebabs and that was great too. Lastly dessert- the midnight express OMG amazing. If you like chocolate, trust me. Get it. Finally the atmosphere is great; unique vibe and loved the piano player/singer.",0
17201,"I recently had the pleasure of dining at this gem of a restaurant, where I chose the Reel Deal with Porgy, which turned out to be exceptional. My friend enjoyed their Fish and Chips, and we both appreciated the light, healthy feel of the cuisine. The skillful cooking allowed us to savor our meal without any post-dining guilt.

The ambiance added to the delightful experience, with an open kitchen and charming lighting enhancing the lovely setup, while the music selection was spot on, creating a perfect dining atmosphere. I absolutely love this place and can't recommend it enough. Eagerly looking forward to my next visit!",1
1016,"3 incredible things to note about Harry's Italian: the food, the service, and THE BRUNCH. Went at 1 pm on a Saturday and there was no wait for a table which is unheard of. The unlimited brunch was super unlimited and they kept the drinks flowing. Even when we finished food, they let us stay the full 2 hours for drinks. The price is incredible for what your getting. The food is excellent, some of the best pizza I've had. The hangover pizza truly helped my hangover and I will be coming back.",0
10615,"Good lunch special deals in the area for about $11. I had the pad thai before which was mediocre. I recommend the chicken curry noodles which is flavorful and not that spicy. The portion is huge, enough for two meals. Not my favorite type of noodles though. If you order it to go they pack extra noodles in a separate container. While I was taking out the noodles, a small smudge of grey was left on the white take out container. No idea where that came from. Might not be the cleanest place to eat.",0
16230,"The pho dac biet (which comes with everything) is one of the best phos I've ever had, let alone ever had in the city. Not only was the broth rich and delicious, the noodles were somehow better than most pho noodles I've had, and the beef was also incredibly tender. The spicy sauce on the side was also quite vinegary and ginger-y, and the garlic was also perfect for cutting the broth. (I'm low key casually drooling while I type this review :)) I will be back soon!",0

Do yourself a favor and make a reservation to ensure you get to experience this gem! Enjoy every moment, as I did.",1
12314,"Title: A Cozy Retreat in Chinatown After a Broadway Show

After catching a matinee of ""Mean Girls,"" my daughter, her friend, and I sought refuge from the cold in a welcoming Chinatown eatery along Mott Street. The area, quieter than usual due to current concerns, had a noticeable impact on local establishments, but our chosen restaurant offered a warm reprieve with promptly served tea upon our entrance.

Opting for comfort, I indulged in fried tiny buns with pork, requiring a 15-minute wait, and a savory Shanghai duck in brown sauce. Meanwhile, my daughter savored the orange chicken, and her friend enjoyed the soup dumplings; both shared their dishes, leaving ample leftovers for home.

The service, admittedly, lagged despite the sparse crowd and visible presence of servers. Nevertheless, the food was delectable, the atmosphere inviting, and the prices reasonable. It was, undeniably, a decent culinary choice that contributed to a pleasant early dinner experience.",1
10498,"Title: New York's Unexpected Taco Gem

I must admit, I approached this New York eatery with skepticism, not expecting tacos that would impress, yet to my delight, they were nothing short of phenomenal. The draw of these tacos proved so strong that I dined here two consecutive nights, conveniently located across the street from the Harry Potter show we attended.

The standout for me was the abodada taco; I've sampled this variety at countless taco joints, but none compared to the perfection I found here. The pork was seasoned and charred to taco nirvana.

The quesadilla deviated from the traditional style I grew accustomed to in Arizona and Mexico. Instead, it presented itself as a gloriously crisp, open-faced taco generously adorned with melting cheese.

The restaurant's atmosphere was vibrant, albeit a tad noisy, with standing shaded seating that added to the casual, bustling vibe. Despite the long lines, they were fast-moving, a testament to the efficiency of the helpful staff who made the wait seem shorter than it was.

In conclusion, this spot is a must-visit for any taco aficionado in New York looking for an exceptional bite in a lively setting.",1
11207,"Title: A Delightful Prelude to Valentine's Day

I recently dined at this charming eatery just before Valentine's Day, and the experience was nothing short of delightful. The festive atmosphere, adorned with heart-shaped wreaths aglow, provided a warm welcome that set the tone for an enchanting evening.

The menu did not disappoint. A glass of exquisite wine paired with a crisp, fresh artichoke salad came highly recommended and surpassed expectations. The four cheese ravioli, a heavenly concoction, was a true testament to the kitchen's prowess—especially impressive given the availability of gluten-free pasta options.

And let's not forget the bread—served warm with a crust that strikes the perfect balance between softness and a delectable crunch. It's a comforting start to any meal.

Whether you're planning a romantic dinner or a cozy meal with a friend, this Italian gem promises an unforgettable culinary affair.",1
11347,"I recently dined at a restaurant where the excellence of the food justified the prices. I can't recommend the salmon enough for its exquisite taste, though it's more of a tease to the appetite than a filler. The octopus offered a good flavor, but its chewiness and under-seasoning suggested there's room for improvement. The calamansi tart was an intense blend of sour and sweet, with the ice cream providing a necessary counterbalance. Be prepared for a hefty bill, it's not for the faint of wallet. Service lagged slightly due to the Friday night rush, with a full house in attendance. All in all, it's a splendid spot for those seeking a sophisticated culinary adventure.",1
16177,"Came here for my 2nd anniversary. While I came in with lofty expectations, Manhatta mostly delivered. Pros: I asked for window seating due to the occasion, which they were able to secure for us. The food was delicious, every bite was what we'd hoped for and was the perfect amount of food. From the foie gras reuben to the wagyu/lobster mains, ultimately to the toasted marshmallow, it was delicious. The views were awesome too.Cons: The service started slow, and became the trend for the evening. We expected high quality service, but instead received slow, inattentive wait staff along with painstakingly long waits between dishes (15-25 minute wait between each dish AFTER completing the previous). Furthermore, we were TWICE asked if we wanted more bread by two different waiters and obliged on both occasions. However, we never received any. For a Danny Meyer restaurant, this was much more flashy than it was efficient.While I was hoping for a pristine experience, this wasn't it. But the combination of the food and the view is worth checking out. 3.5 stars most suits this place.",0
14011,"I recently visited a local eatery, intrigued by the tempting price of their Lunch Box special at just $8.95. Opting for the Chicken Lunch Box, I was served an ample portion of Chicken Tikka Masala accompanied by two vegetarian sides: Chana Masala and what seemed to be Aloo Palak. While the consistency of the veggie dishes suggested they might have been made from leftovers, given their slightly mushy texture, the flavors remained robust and authentically Indian. All in all, the Lunch Box offered a flavorful Indian cuisine experience that was well worth the price.",1

16593,"Title: Delightful Italian Fare with Swift Service

Last evening, after catching a flick at the neighboring cinema, my friends and I decided to dine at this inviting Italian spot. Opting for an al fresco experience, we were promptly seated outside to enjoy the breeze.

As tradition goes, we started with the table bread – nothing extraordinary, but a pleasant start. The star of the night, however, was the penne vodka with added breaded chicken which I ordered. To put it simply, it was divine and left my friend eyeing it with envy despite his own beef lasagna – which, in all fairness, was also quite satisfying.

Surprisingly, our meals arrived with an almost startling efficiency – a mere 15 minutes post-ordering. While unexpected for fine dining, it was a pleasant surprise that didn't compromise the quality.

Our waitress was not just professional but also charming – her makeup was on point, might I add. The rest of the staff mirrored her attentiveness, creating a seamless dining experience.

I'll be returning, perhaps to celebrate my upcoming birthday, as this gem has certainly won my palate and my heart.",1
11248,"Beauty & Essex makes for a lovely place to get all dolled up and celebrate a birthday. Sure, the menu can set you back a pretty penny, but nothing out of the ordinary in Manhattan. I appreciate the change up in the menu every now and then and the permanent fan favorite dishes, such as the Kale & Apple Salad, which according to our server is one of the oldest items on the menu. Side note: our server was the friendliest person in the world. She offered to help us take pictures before our food came and she knew the menu inside and out. I wish I got her name so I could give her a shout out. My party of six decided to get an entree each and get two tapas to share. Tuna Poke Wonton Tacos - From the raw bar. We got one order of this since it came with three tacos and not everyone wanted to have it. I didn't have it since I don't eat raw stuff, but it looked so tiny and cute, and my friends liked it. I think they finished it in two bites. Philly Style Mac & Cheese - My friends had Beauty & Essex's lobster mac & cheese in the past and loved it, so we had to get the mac and cheese again even though the lobster one was taken off the menu. Since one of my friends couldn't eat beef, they served the chunks of short ribs on the side. The mac and cheese was one of the best I've had (better than Mac bar). The texture was just perfect - not too dry but not too liquid-y. The texture was also really interesting since the pasta was bigger than normal and there were strings of veggies or noodles (I couldn't tell what it was). Honestly, the mac and cheese was delicious with and without the short ribs, and I loved it more than my entree.Chile Spiced Dry Aged Burger - I chose this as my main but I was debating between this and the Oven Braised Chicken Meatballs but they couldn't substitute the sheeps milk ricotta, so I went for the burger. The star of the burger dish was actually the bbq flavored fries. I also appreciated how both mayo and ketchup were served on the side. A lot of my friends also got the burger and we all had trouble finishing it. None of the desserts stood out to us, but since we were celebrating my friend's birthday, our waitress gave her a complimentary cupcake with a candle in it. How cute! Also, be sure to visit the bathroom 'cause it would make a cute backdrop in photos.",0
20722,"I recently dined at Farmer's Table and was thoroughly impressed by the innovative dishes that celebrate farm-to-table freshness. The beef and red wine agnolotti paired with roasted baby beets and a sharp gorgonzola was a standout, seamlessly blending hearty flavors with artisanal touches. Additionally, the Brussels sprouts served two ways—raw shredded in a Caesar salad style and perfectly roasted—were a testament to the kitchen's creativity and attention to texture. A must-visit for those who appreciate culinary craftsmanship and fresh, seasonal ingredients. #dodrinkdine #farmerstable",1
1924,"Title: A Slurp-worthy Experience at Jin Ramen in NYC

If you're a ramen enthusiast like me, look no further than Jin Ramen when you find yourself in NYC. My recent visit was a craving-satisfying delight, especially after dodging a 45-minute wait at another spot in Harlem.

Seated immediately upon arrival, service at Jin Ramen was impressively swift, a boon for any hungry patron. The menu boasted an extensive list of options, and the flexibility with side add-ons was a real treat. It was a joy to add a little Kare-age to my meal without committing to a full side order.

I dove into the Tonkotsu Ramen and was met with the authentic depth of flavor that every ramen lover seeks. Not only were the ingredients top-tier, but the portion sizes were so generous I couldn’t even finish my bowl.

Located conveniently near the 1 train, this west Harlem gem is a must-visit for anyone in search of a truly gratifying ramen experience. Jin Ramen ticks all the boxes: taste, service, and location. Don't miss out!",1
14798,"Title: A Lively Midtown Gem with Delightful Bites

My most recent visit to this bustling Midtown restaurant proved once again why it's worth returning to. Arriving at the late hour of 10 pm, after a session of rooftop bar hopping, we were in search of a substantial meal to complement our earlier sushi and drinks. The atmosphere by the bar where we were seated was electric - perfect for a Saturday night out!

Kicking things off with a round of wine, we were quickly served some warm, glutinous bread which was a hit with my boyfriend and daughter. The plain hummus provided was a tad underwhelming, certainly craving a kick of seasoning or garlic.

I sampled the octopus - a few tender, tasty bites that prompted me to take the rest home for later enjoyment. My daughter's salmon was well-prepared, albeit not as rare as our preference. A standout dish was the dorado my boyfriend chose; its flavor was remarkable and worthy of a nod, contributing significantly to our 4-star experience. Oh, and the cherry on top? Scoring 1,000 Open Table points for our meal!

We left satisfied and with intentions of a return - particularly for a happy hour adventure when I'm back in the city on a weekday. A vibrant spot for foodies in search of ambiance and flavor!",1
16378,"Nothing reminds me of home like going to an Australian cafe for breakfast. I often stroll past Coco & Cru, and had heard of it being Australian, so it had been on my list for some time. We finally came here as a party of two on a Sunday, around prime brunch time. We checked in with the hostess, and after being told that it would be about 20-30 minutes, decided to wait, and were just hanging around the front desk area for a few minutes, when she motioned to us and said she could actually seat us now. We were brought copies of the menus and glasses of water immediately. After taking a few minutes to decide, we ordered. Our food was served within 20 minutes. My husband's breakfast sandwich was a standard breakfast sandwich, with fries, egg, cheese, and sausage. He said it was good, but nothing special. My macro bowl consisted of a plate of very simply cooked vegetables, with avocado salsa. The vegetables were so simply prepared and bland tasting, I felt like I could have made something better at home. We were both really quite disappointed with the food. The ambience here is kind of weird - writing on the wall in bright colors, and very loud party music during the day on a Sunday. The acoustics of the cafe are also very bad, so it will be difficult to hear what your dining companion is saying over the din of the room. Would not recommend this place at all, and would not return.",0
2778,"Was feeling Thai food and with the plethora of Thai spots popping up in Hell's Kitchen I decided to give this place a try. It's a tiny storefront so it can be easily missed, but when you walk in, you're greeted with the noodle soup making set up which is very true to noodle stands in Thailand. The place was a bit crowded in terms of seating (came on Saturday for a late lunch) and we (2) had to share a long table with a party of 3 until they finished their meal. Grilled Spicy Beef Salad ($14): perfectly executed. They got it right with the saltiness and sourness of the dish. The beef super tender and nicely marinated. Would've been nice with a side of sticky rice but it was so good we finished it before getting the chance to order. Pad Kee Mao: I made the mistake of ordering it spicy. And BOY WAS IT SPICY. Towards the middle of it, I was picking out the chili peppers (which were cut and crushed so the deathly seeds were everywhere). One thing that threw me off were the snow peas..? I guess they just used whatever veggies that were in season. Anywho, I had to order a Thai ice tea to combat the spiciness, but overall a great dish... I'll get medium spice next time. Ratchaburi Crab & Pork Dry Noodles ($16):  I got this dish with egg noodles. The thinly sliced red bbq pork was amazing, but nothing memorable about the crab meat. It was a nice break from the spicy pad Kee mao but if I were to order a noodle dish again I'd get the noodles with soup and pork only. All in all a great place for pretty legit Thai food, service was fast. Would probably just order out next time to avoid the crowd, though.",0
14006,"Cosme has been on my list for years. I learned of it quickly once I started getting into the restaurant scene here, and seeing the Chef's Table episode on Chef Enrique Olvera only made me more intrigued. There was just one thing holding me back this whole time: the money. Though I had never seen the portions for myself, I had still seen the dizzying number of reviews on all platforms lamenting the absurdity of the prices here, considering what you receive. And they're not wrong. It's bordering on outrageous. To still be nearly starving after consuming $90 worth of food is just stupid. I was planning on docking a full star from the experience due to the price. But the food just kept getting better as the night went on, seemingly unfathomable given how beautifully it all started. By the end, I had no choice. I wanted to stand my ground, unrelenting, but at every turn Cosme was hellbent on changing my mind. Every last little detail here was so pristinely perfected--from the service to the food, to everything in between. Cosme sits at #25 on the list of the World's Top 50 Restaurants, which I suppose warrants the bill we were met with at the end of the night. The technique and creativity are some of the best I've experienced, worth staying in for the next few weekends to repent for the money we spent. A fabulous venue, worth all of the acclaim.Came here at 8:45pm on a Saturday night. The space itself feels like an upscale catalog's rendition of a living room. Certainly on-brand for this area of Flatiron, the city's mecca of fancy home decor. The space itself is quite big. Dark and sleek, fairly minimalist, leaves the fireworks to the food. Drink-wise, Cosme is known for its tequila and mezcal cocktails--bad news for me, as I'm allergic to both (long story). So while I didn't get to try Cosme's specialties, I got to watch my bf enjoy them and still had some solid drinks myself. I first ordered the Martes Gordo (Michters American Whiskey, Paranubes, Avua Cachaca, lime, guava) and then moved to the Gin & Shrub (Farmers, Perry's Tot, guava shrub, lime, Q Tonic). I preferred the latter--wonderfully seasonal and fresh. If you're not into guava, they have strawberry and pear varieties as well.The food here is otherworldly. I've already watched Chef Olvera's Chef's Table episode twice, but it may be time for a refresher. Not that I need to see the food on a screen at this point, I've experienced the real thing. The concept here is just perfectly executed in every way. New, creative and sophisticated spins on traditional dishes and flavors. True mastery of technique and brilliant flavor profiles. The dishes may appear simple at first glance but the precision and attention to detail is significant. I highly recommend sharing. The dishes--even the entrees, it seems--are quite small, so you'll need to order a fair amount to fill up. The only substantial dishes on the menu are the carnitas and pork chop--the rest are teeny tiny. I almost feel like this should be a prix fixe/tasting deal given the price and the portion, but I don't make the rules. See our eats, below:Arctic char, sea buckthorn aguachile, turmeric: AMelts in your mouth, fresh and light. Beautifully presented, gorgeous colors. Simple in presentation, complex in flavors. Comes with a few thin tortillas if you desire. Razor clam tostada, salsa macha, peanuts: A+One very thin tostada with one very thin covering of razor clams and the rest, sitting atop a decorative stone. For such a delicate protein, so much is done with the flavor here. Perfectly balanced, the peanut coming through at the end of the bite. Expert.Crab infladita, morita, avocado: A+Delicious, fresh crab nestled inside a puff pastry of sorts. Pairs wonderfully with the avocado crema on top.Tataki: A+Not sure what kind of fish this was, but it was served with thinly-sliced pineapple on top and a sauce on the side that can only be described as extraterrestrial. An explosion of magic and brilliance. Sensory glitter, minus the cleanup.Bok choy, green mole, morita vinegar: A-Still yummy and aesthetically lovely, a little less exciting than the rest. We just wanted to add some veggies to the bunch. Like the rest, served with tortillas specially made to pair with the dish. Lamb belly tacos, chayote, tamarindo: A++Silly that these two small tacos are considered an entree, yet easily one of the best plates I've ever consumed. Rich and flavors, cooked perfectly, a truly harmonious bite. Butter nut, ha'sikil p'ak, castelrosso: A++Still a little hungry, we tacked this on and it's no doubt the unsung hero of this menu. Yes, we should've tried the carnitas, but my god, even as a sugar addict this might be better than most desserts I've tried. Unbelievably rich, savory, nutty, overwhelming in how delicious it is. I'm working myself into a frenzy just thinking about it. Obviously the corn husk meringue was just a joke. You don't need my review for any hot takes, it's a no-brainer.",0
10111,Went here yesterday for a date night. I made a reservation for 6pm on the yelp app and when i called just to make sure it was confirmed and if i can push the reservations to 6:30pm they said the app was down so it didn't go through and that they were booked for that time so it had to be pushed back till 7pm. I was a little annoyed at that but overall the place was big inside and they food was actually really good and enjoyable. I had a nice time.,0
2281,Philliphino friend took me here! This place is small but cozy. It was busy although it was on Tuesday. Their soup was amazing and other foods were pretty authentic. The price was not overpriced. There was one waitress but she was helpful and was able to handle the crowd! Will be back!,0
12607,"Title: A Manhattan Mexican Feast Worth Every Penny

If you're on the hunt for the finest Mexican cuisine in Manhattan without breaking the bank, this is your go-to spot. I've indulged in their offerings twice and both times left thoroughly impressed.

On my first visit, the pork and pineapple burrito was a revelation – massive and satisfying with a delightful touch of sweetness from the pineapple. The pork was perfectly seasoned, and the essential sides of sour cream and salsa did not disappoint.

My second outing introduced me to the loaded nachos with chicken, which have now stolen the title of my favorite dish. The balance of sour cream, melted cheese, salsa, and plentiful chicken atop crispy chips makes for an unbeatable combination.

Although I sampled a variety of tacos – fish, chicken, and steak – the fish was a tad too fishy for my liking. However, the chicken was spot-on with its seasoning and the steak, albeit slightly on the dry side, was flavorful.

The cherry on top is their outdoor seating, providing a relaxed ambiance that's especially enjoyable in the summertime.

In summary, don't hesitate, just go and treat yourself to this authentic Mexican experience.",1
18157,"Came in on a Wednesday with a reservation for 6 pm for 7 people. They say they don't seat you until your entire party has arrived, but once most of us were there, they let us sit down. To start, we had the Brussels sprouts and the calamari. The sprouts were pretty standard. The calamari would have been good if it wasn't so salty. I did like the aioli (?) sauce that it came with, though. For the main, my cousin and I shared the Chef's special, which was a fontina cheese, mushroom, speck, and spinach. It's not that big but it was enough to fill the both of us, since we also had some apps. I also tried a bite of my other cousin's pasta. I can't remember which one it was but it was some plain, cheese one. It was also super oily, so I don't think the pasta here is worth it for $20 something.While the pizza was pretty good, I don't think it was good enough for me to make a return trip.",0
17548,"Title: A Satisfying Feast at Eat Gai

My recent visit to Eat Gai at the market was an absolute delight. The value for money is exceptional – my fried chicken with rice was just $9.50 and it even included a complimentary soup. The generous portions left me more than satisfied.

Craving some extra crunch, I opted for a side of fries. They arrived perfectly hot and scrumptious, with accompanying sauces elevating the flavors to new heights. However, the standout for me was the fresh coconut water. Priced at $5, not only was it the epitome of refreshment, but it also came served in an adorable coconut – adding to the overall tropical experience.

Beyond the food, what capped off the experience was the commendable service. The staff were the epitome of friendly and attentive, ensuring a pleasant dining experience. Eat Gai is a must-visit for anyone looking for great food, good portions, and excellent service at fair prices.",1
15779,"I recently revisited an impressive food truck that had piqued my interest a few months prior, largely due to a YouTube feature on the owner, Ms. Tami. My sense of excitement was rewarded with a serving of shrimp and grits that was nothing short of fabulous, especially suited for the chill of the day. It provided a comforting warmth with a generous helping of shrimp.

However, my experience was somewhat marred by the fish taco, which, to my disappointment, was served cold. This was particularly disheartening given the lengthy wait one endures for their meal here.

On a brighter note, Ms. Tami is expanding her culinary reach by starting catering for Sunday brunch events, which I am eager to experience, hoping they mirror the warmth and delight of the shrimp and grits rather than the unfortunate chill of the fish taco.",1

11322,"Title: A Gem for Thai Cuisine in NY: Top Thai

Finding authentic and delectable Thai cuisine in New York can be a challenge, but my recent visit to Top Thai has convinced me that the search is not in vain. The restaurant's Basil Udon is a must-try dish that stands out with its impeccably balanced flavors and perfectly sticky, textured noodles. It's quite rich and sweet, so consider sharing.

The Thai iced tea complemented the meal beautifully, but the Spicy Basil Fried Rice, although initially underwhelming, did manage to win us over with time. Unfortunately, the Pad Thai fell flat and was disappointingly watery without the complex flavors one would expect from such a classic dish.

A major disappointment was not being able to try the highly recommended Crab Rangoons due to a vague response on the type of crab used, which is crucial information for someone with specific shellfish allergies.

Service-wise, the staff was friendly, albeit somewhat disorganized, and we faced a reasonable 30-minute wait on a Monday night. For a more casual experience, consider the option of takeout in combination with the BYOF-friendly bar next door, especially if you're looking to catch a game.

In summary, while Top Thai has some areas to improve upon, it offers several standout dishes that will certainly have me coming back for more.",1
18605,"Title: A Dimming Spark at a Once-Vibrant Eatery

Upon entering the restaurant, I was immediately reminded of its captivating concept and charming atmosphere which I've long admired. However, my recent visits suggest that the establishment is experiencing a decline. The once lively and cheerful staff now seem to carry an air of subdued disinterest, which, while not overtly rude, casts a somewhat somber shadow over the dining experience.

The presentation of dishes, a former highlight, continues to delight the eye, yet it's impossible to ignore the palpable shift in energy that once made this place a buzzing hub of gastronomic excitement. Desserts, a steadfast pleasure, remain delicious, but the once impressive array of choices and inventive flair has noticeably waned.

This establishment still holds a dear place in my heart, but I am left longing for the vibrancy and enthusiasm that used to define every visit.",1
21053,"On my numerous visits to this gem in Chinatown, I'm consistently impressed by the vegetarian rice noodles laced with truffle oil – the only dish I ever order here. The noodles are exceptional, making it a must-stop for some delectable vegan ramen every time I'm in the area. The value is unbeatable – delicious and affordable.

The service deserves a special mention; the staff is unfailingly pleasant, enhancing the dining experience each time. While the cash-only policy might be a slight inconvenience for some, the proximity of banks makes it a minor issue. Overall, this restaurant is a top pick for a casual and wallet-friendly meal that never disappoints.",1
11892,"This is my third or forth time visiting Madame Vo. I was kind of disappointed to find out that they discontinued the Bone Marrow Pho. Their Pho is great, the broth is a little too sweet for me. The beefs are so tenders. I decided to tried the vermicelli dish with honey pork. The pork is so good. The dish blends well together. However, the portion is a bit small for the price.",0
14139,"Title: A Cozy 3 AM Feast at BCD Tofu House

I kicked off 2019 with a memorable late-night meal with friends at BCD Tofu House in Koreatown. Its communal dining atmosphere and value for money are impressive. Despite a 45-minute wait for our group of five, the culinary experience was worth every minute.

The scallion pancake and banchan set the stage with their bold flavors and spice. But the real standout was the soontofu - a customizable tofu stew with varying heat levels. Opting for mild due to my spice sensitivity, I was delighted with the hearty and savory broth served in a sizzling cast iron pot. The generous portions even allowed for leftovers.

BCD Tofu House shines as a group-friendly spot with efficient service post-seating. This cold night comfort food experience leaves me eager to visit their other Southern California locations.",1
19692,"Stumbled upon this little gem while waiting for friends in the area, and what a delightful find! The ambiance hits you with a cool vibe the moment you walk in, making it clear this isn't your average wine and beer joint. We went for the mozzarella sticks on a whim, and they did not disappoint—crispy, gooey, and utterly delicious. This spot is perfect for locals looking to unwind and catch up with pals. A must-visit if you're in the neighborhood and in the mood for a laid-back hangout.",1
20647,"Title: Cozy Ambiance, Attentive Service, but Mixed Feelings on the Fare

Last Thursday, I joined friends for a 6pm dinner at a snug, atmospherically lit restaurant. While the moody setting created a nice vibe, the dim lighting proved challenging for menu perusal.

Service shone brightly, with frequent water refills and regular check-ins — a commendable highlight.

Anticipation was stoked by alluring Yelp photos, but my Lo Ba Bang—a rice bowl with pork, bamboo shoots, egg, and cilantro—left me with mixed emotions. After mixing as suggested, its initial allure waned, turning into a fried rice-esque dish that quickly felt too rich. It's certainly tasty, but best in moderation, as I couldn't finish it in one sitting. The good news: leftovers served as a hearty lunch the next day.

A taste of my friend's Hsinchu mifen—a stir-fried vermicelli—provided a contrasting, lighter pleasure and was a satisfying discovery.

While the food experience had its ups and downs, the overall dining encounter was pleasant enough to warrant a return, perhaps for lighter fare next time.",1
19921,"Visited a small local restaurant for lunch on a bustling weekday and faced a brief 10-minute wait for a table due to the crowd. The space is somewhat cramped, with diners seated very close to one another.

We kicked off our meal with the umami corn, a dish that failed to impress. Despite an enticing menu description, the portion was disappointingly small and the corn lacked the expected sweet flavor.

On a brighter note, the mango creamy soda I ordered was a refreshing choice, and the melon version on the menu sparked my curiosity for a future visit.

The tantanmen ramen, enhanced with a perfectly cooked egg, was the star of the show. At $17, it may be considered pricier, but the savory broth with a touch of heat and well-prepared noodles made it a dish worth returning for.

No issues with the service were noted, and the restaurant's quaint decor added charm to the experience. If you find yourself in the area, this spot is certainly worth considering for its ramen offerings.",1
16487,"We came here for an early dinner on our recent trip to NYC. The lady at the front said that they had to check for reservations, but there was no wait and the restaurant was only half full when we entered. This place is very centrally located, only steps away from Times Square. There is a 2nd level upstairs with dim lighting and more booth seats. I did not appreciate how the lights were broken for the table that we were assigned to, and we were eating in darkness for most of our meal.Service was very curt and rushed, as the waiter came to ask if we were ready to order just when we sat down. It was also difficult to get the waiter's attention to refill our glasses and pay our bill. We ordered the Lobster Rolls, which came with a side salad and fries. The lobster roll tasted great, and there were generous pieces of lobster in it. Coming from Canada, I've had better lobster in Toronto and Nova Scotia, but I understand that is hard to compare. The fries were a bit dry and hard, so most of it was left unfinished. Overall, it was a decent place for a quick meal and drinks when in the area! I'm a bit surprised by the amazing reviews though, as there are better seafood places around.",0
16860,Home of the jumbo slices. This location just opened. The slices are gianormous. It probably comes out to about 2 slices maybe a little more and at $5.50 a slice its a good price. The pizza is delicious and has alot of cheese. Definitely hits the spot if you crave pizza.,0
12790,"Don't even stop by this place for a second. Their margaritas are awful ($50 for a pitcher), and the food and service is worse. It was horribly overpriced and the server couldn't even bother to bring us silverware or water. When I asked for salsa for our quesidilla I could sense the waitresses disdain. What a request, salsa???Honesty very turned off by everything to do with this place.",0
18421,"I love this spot! I've been here multiple times now and it truly gets better each time. The interior decor is incredible, the staff is friendly and the food is phenomenal. The Chilean sea bass and veggie garlic lunch special are my favorite dishes and you have to try the Thai iced tea if you're in the mood for something sweet! The way they plate and present each dish is so unique and adds so much to the overall experience. Excellent restaurant.",0
1477,Came here with friends multiple times! I truly enjoy the delicious food options and definitely their roti! There are many spicy foods options on the menu but definitely worth giving them a chance. They are really efficient waiting staff and it's one of the better southeast Asian food options in Chinatown. It's also a pretty big restaurant for Chinatown sizing.,0
1422,"Excellent service. Our waiter was on top of everything, making sure we understood just how the menu worked and what we would enjoy given our interests. The noodles are delicious, appetizers are great and the perfect size for two to share. They have cash incentives but accept all major cards. I look forward to coming back and trying more of their menu options",0
11260,"This is of the finest vegan restaurants of the city. They are located in a fine neighborhood, their food is unique and special (some of the plates are even artistic), their service is good and the place has a very quite, romantic ambiance.The only downside is their prices - a bit too expensive! Desserts were almost 20 dollars each!this time we had the cheese platter for an appetizer (ranked no.2 in my list of all the cheese platters I had), and for entrees we shared the mushroom crepe and the chickpea cake. The latter was a piece of art, but I think that the crepe was my favorite one.",0
17332,"One of my favorite tapas restaurant in the city. Great for groups. They have a broad array of authentic Spanish tapas with a great complimentary wine list. If you are going with a large party, recommend the chef's list with that includes tapas, paella & dessert for $50/pp. It encompasses plenty of food. The happy hour menu is also a good value.",0
14527,"In a word: underwhelming. I've been to China and I've been to Cuba, and this was reminiscent of neither country's cuisine. The concept was really interesting and I loved that they paid homage to Havana's now defunct Chinatown. But the food was less than stellar. We checked in on yelp and got the free yuca fries (which were crispy and seasoned well and far better than the entree I paid for. Not amazing or life changing, but better.) I ordered the Cuban eggs Benedict and it was kind of awful. The eggs Benedict consisted of the toughest English muffin I've ever tried to cut into (really, it should have been described as a biscuit), some unseasoned pulled pork, and a poached egg. Seasoning was definitely missing overall with it. The restaurant is conveniently located near Bryant Park and the decor is really cute, but there's a lot lacking to be desired with their food. Will definitely not be returning.",0
3101,"Been ordering from this location both for pickup in person and for delivery, and they are pretty consistent. Quinoa taco salad is still the best, though the crispy chicky salad is also amazing. Guac burger, too!",0
20321,"My dinner here was absolutely amazing. Service was great and the set up inside is very fun. Honestly what shocked me about this place was how affordable it is, I expected a place literally called steak and lobster to be pretty expensive but the whole menu is very reasonable especially considering the quality of food you're getting. My lobster was cooked to perfection and I love when lobster is served cut in half because it makes it so much easier to eat and enjoy! The cheese steak pierogies were also to die for as was the lobster mac & cheese.Super convenient area if you are going to an event at Madison Square Garden or coming into Penn. would highly recommend and will definitely be back!!",0
2411,Came here for a work holiday party and this place exceeded expectations! The service was quick and friendly and the ambiance and decor inside was actually very aesthetically pleasing. The place was charming overall and actually really big! There's multiple rooms in this pub and you can hang out wherever you want. We were catered several finger foods and appetizers and the most memorable meal I had was the penne with a vodka sauce. It was delicious! Usually pasta doesn't taste good at a pub but it definitely hit the spot. Overall pleased with my experience here and looking forward to coming back!,0
15912,"Title: Fresh and Satisfying Salad Experience

Salad joints are becoming as ubiquitous as burger spots, and this place proves why. I grabbed a to-go salad that was generous enough to serve two. The chicken shawarma was flavorful, and the option to add personalized toppings was a bonus. The bowl was brimming with fresh ingredients, so much so that we transferred it to a larger bowl to mix in the dressing – a small effort for such a hearty meal. They even provided extra dressing without an additional cost. This spot has won us over; we're already planning our next visit.",1
16662,"Title: A Royal Feast Without the Royal Price Tag!

If you're on the hunt for incredible value without skimping on flavor, look no further! My lunch experience here was nothing short of remarkable – a true feast fit for a king at a pauper's price. A shared pizza and individual pasta dishes left us stuffed and satisfied for a mere $15 each, thanks to the unbeatable lunch special.

Every bite was a delight, confirming that this spot is a hidden gem in the world of casual dining. The bustling crowd was a testament to its popularity and the quality of the food. I'm already planning my return visit next week. Don't miss out on this place!",1

15557,"My recent dining experience at Little Alley left an indelible mark on my palate. Each dish stood out, but the duck yolk rice cakes were a particular highlight – simply amazing. The honey kaofu caught my attention as well; a clever vegetarian delight where bean curd convincingly takes the place of meat nuggets. The crab soup dumpling and water spinach were also very good, rounding out a meal that was as unique as it was memorable. As for the setting, the noise level and ambiance strike the perfect balance for a romantic date or a relaxed conversation with a friend. Little Alley is a gem worth experiencing for anyone in search of distinctive flavors and a comfortable dining atmosphere.",1

14287,"Came here to pick up my lunch order with my colleague today for the first time, and at first glance I can tell my meal was burnt. Then I ate it, and not only was it burnt, the chef was very heavy handed with the vinegar. I ordered Tofu Pad See Ew, and it has been by far the worst pad see ew I've ever had. It wasn't sweet and savory like it's supposed to be, instead saying it left a bitter taste in my mouth is a bit of an understatement. 2 stars because at least the order was on time for pickup and their spring roll was good.",0
3638,"I recently visited a lively spot where the service truly shined, complemented by bartenders who radiated friendliness. My choice from the menu was a single pretzel, which surprisingly turned out to be a colossal offering that could easily stand in as a full meal.

Despite the noise, the standout service and that impressive pretzel have earned this place a solid 3-star rating from me.",1
17287,"I recently visited Lido for a Saturday brunch and the experience was delightful, though I'd recommend a reservation due to its popularity. Upon arrival, our party was seated immediately, and our server, Alex, was notably attentive and friendly throughout our meal. 

While the short rib hash benedict I ordered didn't quite meet my expectations, it was still flavorful. In contrast, my friends savored their french toast and omelet, clearly indicating a varied menu with something for everyone. The highlight was the bottomless mimosas that truly lived up to their name.

Having had lunch at Lido before, where the chicken burger and zucchini fries impressed, I'd certainly return to try other dishes on the menu. Overall, Lido offers a pleasant atmosphere with commendable service and a promise of good food.",1
2915,"I've only ever had Little Sheep Mongolian Hot Pot soup base that I've gotten from Chinese supermarkets. This was my first time going to the actual restaurant. Getting in the waitlist was easy thanks to the Yelp app! It is not hard to miss this place, the door is pretty obvious on the busy street. Staff were able to speak fluent English, Cantonese and Mandarin.When I first walked in, there was a large crowd of 12-15 at the door. They specifically requested that they all sit at the same table and were a bit complicated. The staff did all they could to make sure to get them tables that are next to each other. They almost had the last few seats for this group, but the group decided to leave. As rude as that sounds, the staff here were pretty nice about it, but were disappointed. One guy had to explain to their boss on the phone why that happened. I'm sure that's not the type of phone call anyone wants to make. PLEASE don't be those people.After that was settled, I was seated immediately. We sat near the ""kitchen"" area. We got to see how things work HAHAHA The food comes already set on trays out of this ""elevator"" thing and when bins of dirty dishes are full, the bins are sent in that ""elevator"" thing too! We were a party of 2, so we didn't order too much, but the food came out fast and in decent portions. If you order more than your table can hold, they have these stands that hold trays to essentially extend your table space. Once you order, you can go make your own dipping sauces. I was just a bit confused that the sauce bowls were messily put into the bin, but I'd like to assume those were the clean ones? :| Overall, I'm glad I can still get their soup base at the supermarkets. They restaurant was clean, spacey and fast paced. I'd definitely recommend this place!",0
18262,"Title: A Bustling BBQ Haven at Hill Country

My visit to Hill Country on a busy Friday evening was a delightful foray into the world of barbecue. The atmosphere was lively, verging on noisy, reflecting the crowd's energy. The unique order-by-the-pound system added a touch of novelty as we picked out our meal components.

The moist brisket and spare ribs were the stars of the show, packing a flavorful punch, while the turkey—a protein I'm typically indifferent towards—was pleasantly surprising. On the side, the mac and cheese stood out with its creamy goodness, and the mashed sweet potatoes were a delectable surprise. Unfortunately, the cole slaw missed the mark with its chunky, underdressed cabbage.

Service was hit-or-miss; it was understandable given the bustling scene but could have been more attentive. Despite the minor setbacks, Hill Country nailed the barbecue essentials, making it a great spot to satisfy those BBQ cravings.",1
16617,"Title: A Delightful Evening at Wolfgang's

My recent visit to Wolfgang’s was nothing short of exceptional. The restaurant exudes an old-school charm with its beautiful décor, creating an inviting atmosphere for diners. Service was top-notch; attentive without being overbearing, and our 7:30 reservations on a busy Saturday allowed for an unhurried dining experience. An unexpected treat was meeting Wolfgang himself, who mingled with guests and kindly took photos.

The cuisine was outstanding. The bacon and iceberg wedge salad was a highlight, featuring thick, juicy, and well-cured bacon accompanied by fresh lettuce and a tangy, aromatic blue cheese dressing that’s a must-try. They’re happy to split dishes for sharing, which is a plus.

For the main course, the porterhouse for three was a carnivore's dream - cooked to perfection and savory in every bite. Having dined at a Wolfgang's in midtown previously, I can confidently say this location has my preference, predominantly for its great vibe and impeccable food and service.",1
11524,"Title: A Feast for the Senses at a Local Culinary Gem

From the moment our party of eight stepped into this splendid restaurant, we were enveloped in a world of gastronomic delights. Our experience kicked off with a selection of wines, a red and a white, both of which my companions found to be exquisite choices for our diverse spread. Though I personally sipped on a finely crafted whisky highball, it set a pleasant tone for the meal ahead.

The baked ricotta was an absolute triumph, a creamy concoction that married beautifully with the provided bread and biscuits, its subtle sweetness a perfect counterpoint to the richness. The roasted carrots, while flavorful, did succumb slightly to an overzealous saucing. However, the pizzas truly stole the show; the Brussels sprouts variant offered a tinge of spice that enlivened the palate, and the date, mozzarella, bacon, chili, and radicchio pizza was the night's star—a symphony of sweet, savory, spicy, and creamy notes that danced across the taste buds.

I didn't partake in the char sashimi, having reached my limit, though it looked tantalizing. As for the main course, the roasted black bass was a marvel, its tender flesh complementing the tangy herb vinaigrette and cauliflower with sheer eloquence. My friend's short ribs came highly recommended and judging by their satisfaction, you can't go wrong with this hearty choice.

This establishment is not just a restaurant; it's a celebration of flavors that promises—and delivers—an unforgettable dining experience.",1
11482,"Title: Unassuming Gem in the Heart of NYC

At first glance, the exterior of this café may not catch your eye, with its worn awning hinting at a need for a makeover. However, once inside, the vibe shifts positively. The spacious interior boasts a plethora of tables, ensuring that finding a spot to relax or work—with the boon of dependable Wi-Fi (accessible with a purchase, as the credentials are smartly printed on your receipt)—is a breeze.

Culinary offerings range from fresh salads and hearty sandwiches to an inviting array of desserts, all perfect for those seeking a swift yet satisfying bite. The establishment masterfully blends the roles of a convenience store, café, and lunch spot, making it an invaluable addition to the bustling New York City scene.

While the ambiance is comfortable and the location convenient, the notion of a 4-star rating seems overzealous. A solid 3-star rating is a fair testament to this cozy and utilitarian spot's charm and service.",1
16592,"Today, my workplace's weekly lunch featured catering from a local restaurant that truly impressed us all. We indulged in an array of dishes, from savory kebabs to a vibrant green shakshuka. Each bite was delightful, as evidenced by my plate (photo attached). The salmon, particularly, stood out for its spot-on preparation, flaky and flavorful. Accompanying the meal, the pita bread was a standout – incredibly soft and fresh, unlike any other catered fare I've had.

1011,"Title: A Nostalgic Bite at South Wind's Hidden Gem

Upon hearing about a quaint eatery that promised a taste of my childhood favorites from the old South Wind, my curiosity was piqued. True to its reputation, the restaurant delivered an impressive culinary experience. The Hak Roll, freshly made, was a standout and is a must-try for any visitor. The dumplings, reminiscent of 'the good old days', were a comforting nod to traditional flavors.

I initially mistook the tofu with meat filling for being undercooked due to its unusual texture, but after a pleasant conversation with Warren, the amiable owner-manager, I learned it was intentionally a bit gooey – a delightful surprise. Warren's dedication to customer satisfaction was further demonstrated when he graciously provided a replacement dish, exemplifying exceptional service.

The only minor drawback is the restaurant's size. A larger space could enhance their ability to serve more customers without sacrificing quality. Nonetheless, any wait is justified by the quality of their food. For anyone seeking authentic flavors and a warm customer experience, this is your go-to place.",1
18744,"So glad I finally tried this place after missing out my last couple NYC trips. I have to agree with everyone who's saying that this is the best udon they've ever had in the US (better than the ones I've had in Tokyo too).Opted for the JA JA (COLD UDON) because NYC was doing its best Southeast Asia impression in terms of humidity. I was hesitant at first because the one or two photos of it they had on Yelp didn't look that great, but the waitress highly recommended it when I tried going for another cold udon option. It's very similar to the Taiwanese cold noodle (凉面), except utilizing baby tomatoes (along with the cucumbers) and a sauce based around the spicy ground pork.Also tried some of the CURRY (HOT UDON) which had the same handmade udon noodles (very thick, chewy, and uniquely good) and a very flavorful broth. I've heard good things about the NIKU (HOT UDON) with honeycomb tripe and beef short rib, so definitely coming back to try that during the fall.Quantity wise, I think the hot udon was definitely a lot more generous than the cold noodle options, so keep that in mind. It looked as if there was a lot more of both noodles and meat.CHICKEN KARAAGE was also one of the best I've ever had due to its juiciness and the crispiness of the breading.

11031,"Title: A South Indian Delight on Lexington Avenue

Having frequented numerous Indian eateries in both New York's Lexington Avenue and across New Jersey, I can confidently proclaim that I've discovered a gem that stands out from the rest. Despite initial reservations based on mixed Yelp reviews, my experience at this establishment turned out to be a revelation, making me regret not stepping in sooner.

Their South Indian lunch thali, modestly priced at $13.99 from Monday to Friday, is a parade of flavors and textures that pays homage to authentic South Indian cuisine. The thali is a well-rounded feast that includes a creamy sweet rice pudding and a selection of curries that are both hearty and nuanced. The dry gourd curry charms with its simplicity, while the ridge gourd dal is the perfect accompaniment for the soft chapati served alongside. The radish sambar is a comforting blend of lentils, radish, and drumsticks, ideal with rice, and the tangy tomato-lentil rasam is nothing short of soul-soothing.

Adding to the mix are the cool and crunchy raita, a yogurt delicacy studded with carrots and the right hint of seasoning, as well as the quintessential crispy papad and tangy pickle. A cup of plain yogurt provides a soothing finish to the palate. And for those who appreciate a good brew, their filter coffee, though milder than expected, is a satisfying end to an extraordinary meal.

In conclusion, this restaurant has undoubtedly set the bar high for South Indian thalis in the area, and I eagerly anticipate my next visit.",1
1336,"Title: Decent Spot for Casual Eats

My friends and I dropped in for dinner the other evening and decided to give the bar area a try. I've got to hand it to the service; it was fantastic. The bartender struck the perfect balance between giving us space to choose and being attentive to our needs.

We ordered the fried chicken burger and the al chapo. The al chapo, a robust dish, was quite enjoyable, though it leaned more toward well done than the medium I prefer. However, the chicken sandwich didn't hit the mark for me. I'm not a fan of greasiness in my fried chicken, and unfortunately, the sandwich was oily on the inside.

While I'm not compelled to make a special trip back, if you happen to be around and are looking for an easy dining option with great service, it's worth a shot.",1
2976,"Title: A Slice of Culinary Elegance at Bohemian

My anticipation to dine at Bohemian had been building for quite some time, and recently, I gratefully seized the chance to experience it firsthand. The restaurant is a hidden gem, discreetly nestled away from the prying eyes of the bustling street – a discovery only for those in the know.

Upon entering, I was greeted by an ambiance that mirrored the warmth and style of a well-appointed friend's living room, with an attention to cleanliness that extended even to the bathroom. This attention to detail set a sophisticated tone from the outset.

Opting for the January 2019 tasting menu, which I enthusiastically documented with photos and descriptions, I found myself immersed in a culinary journey marked by exceptional highlights. The Bozushi, a singular piece of smoked salmon on sushi rice, was a testament to Bohemian's philosophy: quality and thoughtfulness in every small portion. Its flawless execution left a lasting impression.

The sashimi selection was a buttery symphony of flavors that evoked an emotional response from me, hinting at the possibility of tears shed for its sheer perfection. The famed steak, specifically the ribeye, lived up to its reputation, while the udon intrigued with its complexity, a satisfying final savory note.

Glancing at neighboring tables, I noted that both the a la carte and standard menu options appeared equally tempting, promising a return visit would be equally rewarding. With a couple of seasonal tasting menus complemented by a cocktail and a bottle of wine, the total bill approached $300. A fair sum considering the impeccable service and the culinary delights that graced our table.

In summary, Bohemian delivered an exquisite dining experience. It's a place where food and service converge to create an unforgettable evening. I'm already yearning for my next visit.",1
19567,Booked Vic's for a brunch via the Yelp app. Sat on time and service was on top on it all. Choice between still and sparkling water to start while we were waiting for a delayed diner. The brunch menu isn't large but the selections are perfect for everyone. I ordered the Poached Eggs over polenta which was delicious. The coffee (free refills) was great and the wait staff were constantly keeping an eye on your coffee cup level. Would definitely recommend Vic's to all. Reservations are definitely required for brunch.,0
14807,"Title: A Happy Hour Haven Worth the Buzz

Last Saturday night's Happy Hour adventure led me to a bustling hub where reservations are golden, but the wait (just over an hour, shorter at the bar) is a small price to pay for the exhilarating experience ahead.

Drinks flowed, with the Hacienda leading the charge - first round perfection, with a slight dip in round two consistency. A surprising hero emerged in the Dark & Stormy, defying my usual preferences with its robust allure, while the Aerosol Spritz and Mermaid Mary trailed behind but still delighted the palate.

Food is a highlight here. The Grilled shrimp & avocado slider is a star, demanding an encore, as did the impeccably fresh oysters. Salmon tartare catered to my raw-fish affection, but the buttered lobster roll, though tasty, didn’t quite justify its price. Despite their oiliness, the Mini mermaid dish tacos and the average clams couldn’t dampen my spirits.

Kudos to the staff, the crème de la crème of hospitality; Jeremy, the bartender, and the servers radiated friendliness. Though space is tight, the cleanliness outshines any sense of being cramped.

A return visit? Undoubtedly. This is a spot where the Happy Hour glow doesn't fade.",1
1257,"Visited an extremely snug eatery for a quick breakfast on a Friday morning, just past the usual rush. With no queue, I skimmed the vast menu and opted for the day's special: an Egg & Cheese Piadine, plus a 10oz drip coffee from Illy—a robust choice—at a total of $12 with added bacon.

The drink was served promptly, but the Piadine stole the show—its exterior akin to a buttered roti, and its belly generously filled with eggs, bacon, and cheese. However, a lack of seasoning in the eggs necessitated a dash of hot sauce for enhanced flavor. Despite this, the meal was greasy to the touch and satisfyingly hearty.

The establishment caters to a transient crowd, offering a handy luggage-holding service, which is a thoughtful touch. It's unfortunate that they're closed on Saturdays, but for a weekday breakfast or lunch, it's a solid choice.",1
20326,So I was looking for somewhere to eat as I was walking down 57th St. I gave up dairy for Lent so my options are limited.The Brooklyn diner has been here for years so I took a look at the menu and came in.The ambience is old World and so inviting!I was there a couple minutes before anyone came up to see me a delightful manager with small round glasses sat me.My waiter even though he only had a few tables seemed a bit overwhelmed when I asked about the veggie burgers he didn't give me much of an explanation except to say that it came with cheese and tomato and they were homemade.My order was a veggie burger well done no cheese guacamole on the side no Catsup.I received my veggie burger undercooked three minutes after taking my order he came up with a dish of catch-up for me. I carefully put it on the table next to me.I believe he got annoyed with me when I had said I didn't want catch up.I ate my entire lunch and it wasn't until I was finished that the waiter came up to ask if I wanted another Coke. Not how was everything or do you need anything but do you want another Coke.The food is OK  and the he fries have nice flavoring and the veggie burger wasn't as bad as I thought it would be but the service is horrible!!!Except for the wonderful floor manager.As I was sitting waiting for the waiter to come up and take my order I noticed the managing director at the counter moving some chairs around he didn't smile he looked unhappy and gave me some weird look as he walked by me.The thing I find with Brooklyn diner is the bazaar customer service.The music is too loud and it goes from straight Spanish music to Frank Sinatra then back to Spanish music.So I guess the music is for more the employees than the guests.Brooklyn diner I would assume would have music from the 1950s since that's what all the pictures displayed are from and that is the theme that this restaurant is supposed to portray.,0
11605,"3.5/5, +.5 for serviceI certainly give Nakamura points for its diverse menu, catering to those who might not be able to devour pork broth (such as my mother). Regardless of my rating, it's definitely a place I'd return only because there's enough choices that fit my entire family's tastes.For this visit I had the Tontoro Pork Ramen, while my mom had the Jidori Ramen and my dad had the Curry Spiced Ramen. The food honestly took a lot longer than expected; it didn't arrive until about 15 minutes after ordering...in fact my ramen was more lukewarm than piping hot. However I can still tell the ramen quality was excellent, the chashu was marbly and juicy, and the pork broth was creamy and delicious. My mom had no complaints about the Jidori Ramen, and my dad found his Curry Spiced Ramen unique as well.Service was excellent and we didn't feel rushed at all despite the restaurant size. I'd definitely return and hope next time they would speed up the process a bit more.",0
3365,"I have been dreaming about this food ever since our first visit! The restaurant we wanted to go to before our Wednesday 8pm show did not take reservations, and when we were turned away at the door my boyfriend and I had to scramble for a plan B. We yelped other places with pasta in the area, and this had the best rating by far, within our price range, and a big menu. So we made a quick reservation and ran over.First of all, there were 2 doors oeading to the same restaurant. One that went up, and one that went down. On what I thought was the main door was a sign that said ""please use the other door"" which then ended up being the wrong door. It was confusing, and frustrating to say the least. When we were finally seated, in what seems like a pretty empty upstairs, I warned them about our theatre plans, and they assured us we would be out on time. With that in mind, we were left with the menus way too long, and needed to flag someone down to take our order. The service was slow, I think they were understaffed for the evening.But the food made up for it. I was torn between 4 or 5 menu items, but landed on the Farfalle in a Brandy Tomato Cream Sauce. I switched salmon for chicken, and I almost inhaled my whole plate. The portions were bigger than I had ever seen on one plate, and were definitely worth what we paid for, especially near the heart of Times Square! Definitely go if you can, but make sure you arent in a rush! My boyfriend and I plan on becoming regulars",0
11378,"I came here on a Friday for date night and the ambiance was really modern and clean. The service was excellent as well with very attentive staff. The food was good but not particularly unique to this Korean restaurant aside from the desserts. From the menu, they recommend 2 dishes from the ""To-Start"" which are appetizers and 1 dish from the ""To-Share"" which are larger dishes. I'd consider doing the reverse for more food and slightly more value.Truffle Mandoo: My favorite dish of the night even though there were only 3 raviolis since they used fresh black truffle shavings that had a really strong flavor. It was certainly a truffle centered dish. Sea Urchin Noodle: I could probably eat about 3 of these by myself, it was that good. Wagyu Tartare: The wagyu that was used had some tendons in it that made it far chewier than I'm used to, but it could have just been the batch. It was otherwise very tasty and I enjoyed that they paired it with rice chips for texture and Asian pears for some sweetness.Black Rice Calamari: The black rice gave the calamari a very nice crunch without any grease from many other fried calamari dishes. The Thai basil aioli was a good compliment and dipping sauce for the calamari, which was both crunchy and tender. This was the only dish I thought was a good portion size out of everything we ordered.Seafood: This was ridiculously small for what they charge. It had about 3 small pieces of seabass, 4 shrimp, 1 sea scallop (cut into 3 pieces), a bunch of mussels and a little squid. Not worth $32, but it was still tasty.Thai Tea Crème Brûlée: Fantastic dessert, I'd get this every time I visit. The fresh fruit with the nice light Brulee on top was a nice contrast to the creamy Thai Tea. The glass literally needs to be about 3 times more filled otherwise, it was perfect.Black Sesame Ice Cream Sandwich: This was a bit of a surprise that it turned out to be an ice cream sandwich. It was a nice touch to have the sesame seeds coating the edge of the ice cream. Nicely balanced flavor from the black sesame and slight crunch of the sandwich. I could accidentally eat 3 or 4 of them and be very happy. Value-wise it's not great, even for two people since the portions are fairly small for both starters and shared dishes. I'd go back for a select few dishes and potentially trying the Truffle Donabe, but knowing that it's not for portion size and strictly for taste.",0
11665,"Title: Quaint Brunch Spot with Live Tunes

I recently enjoyed a brunch outing with a friend at this charming eatery, complete with live music and a welcoming, spacious atmosphere. Though the packed weekend crowd meant a bit of a wait for service, the robust menu had me wishing for a larger appetite – the French toast awaits my next visit!

I indulged in the egg yolk raviolo, a delightful mushroom lover's dream, nestled on a bed of fresh veggies. The portion was generous, leaving me satisfyingly sated without being overstuffed.

Despite the slight delay in service, the food arrived swiftly once ordered. The entire experience has piqued my curiosity about their dinner offerings, which I'm eager to return and sample. A cozy venue for a hearty meal and a soothing melody – this spot hits the right notes for a lazy weekend brunch.",1

I recently tried a new spot in town and ordered an upper east side cheesesteak for pickup via the Ritual app. Arriving a tad early, I noticed the charming and spotless storefront complemented by cozy bar seating. While waiting, I sampled their chicken pot pie soup—courtesy of the delightful staff—which hinted at the deliciousness to come.

My cheesesteak was generously portioned and exceeded expectations in flavor. I caught a glimpse of their salads, which looked fresh and appetizing; I'm eager to try one on my next visit. The warm and accommodating service here truly elevates the dining experience. Highly recommend for a tasty meal and friendly atmosphere!",1
14304,"Title: A Rollercoaster of Flavors at Local Ramen Joint

My dining experiences at this ramen spot have been a mixed bag. During our initial visit, the late-night Koku Ramen, customized with an extra egg and menma in lieu of nori, was delightfully savory. It was a promising start. On a subsequent visit, the spicy ramen was merely passable, but the chicken karage stole the show with its exceptional taste - the light, crispy batter coupled with the tantalizingly spicy sauce turned it into a must-have dish.

Our latest foray included the kimchi tan tan ramen, which unfortunately fell short of expectations. Lacking both the anticipated kimchi presence and a spicy kick, it was an underwhelming choice. Thankfully, the consistently outstanding chicken karage came to the rescue once again, reassuring us that some items on the menu are worth coming back for.

As for the service, it's been reasonably good each time. Overall, while the food quality vacillates, the chicken karage remains a standout star, meriting a return visit all on its own.",1

My friends and I ventured to this gastronomic gem for their bottomless offering, and the experience left us thoroughly impressed. The portions served were massive, yet quality wasn't compromised. As a self-professed burger connoisseur, their cheeseburger won over my discerning palate – a feat not easily achieved.

The service was impeccable, with attentive staff frequently ensuring our dining experience was nothing short of excellent. Do note that the popularity of this spot means it can get quite packed, so reservations are a wise move.

In summary, I wholeheartedly recommend a visit to this restaurant for an indulgent and satisfying meal. Bon appétit!",1
15932,"Came here for my 2nd year anniversary which happened to fall on TG day. I enjoyed it, the ambience, the vibes, the service and the food. Yes, it is a bit pricey, but it's one of the trendiest restaurants right now. I don't eat meat but I am a pescatarian so there are a few choices but very delimiter choices for vegetarians and vegans. Btw we went for dinner so I'm not too sure if there are more choices during other day courses. My husband said the steak was one of the best he has ever eaten. What I would say is, I have been to Turkey and it's one of my favorite counties I have visited and lived in for a few months. So I just wish there were more inspired Turkish foods. I believe it leans more to the steakhouse  than the Turkish side. However, from a conversation with a waitress, if I'm not mistaken everything and everyone in there is from Turkey or have lived there, so that's including the steak, utensils and employees. Which is pretty cool. It's really nothing but vibes.",0
18624,"Title: A Culinary Delight to Cap Off a Day of Culture

After a day immersed in the arts at the museum, my partner and I were eager to relax and refuel. We chose the perfect spot that complemented our cultured day—a delightful restaurant where the experience started off on a high note with our reservation honored promptly, and we were seated immediately.

The staff were quick to inform us that the menu was designed with sharing in mind, allowing us to sample a wider array of flavors. Our culinary journey ranged from a smooth, rich hummus to a vibrant beet salad, and culminated in perfectly pillowy gnocchi. Each dish was robust in flavor, and the atmosphere of the restaurant only added to the enjoyment, buzzing with energy that made our dining experience even more enjoyable.

To accompany our meal, we perused an extensive cocktail menu. The selection was so enticing, it was a challenge to choose, but our original picks were so satisfying that we saw no need to venture further; they were the perfect pairing to our delectable dishes.

In summary, this restaurant is a must-visit for those who appreciate a fun atmosphere and shared plates brimming with heartiness. It's unquestionably repeat-worthy and has certainly earned a spot on our list for future dining excursions.",1
265,"Title: Disappointing Experience Post-Show at Local Italian Gem

After a delightful Broadway show, my friend and I turned to Yelp for an Italian feast, led by shining reviews to what we thought would be a culinary curtain call. Our experience, however, fell several acts short of a standing ovation.

To the restaurant's credit, we were seated instantly—a mercy for our ravenous states—which earns the establishment a generous three-star nod. But our initial relief soured as we found ourselves sandwiched between patrons, my dining companion's elbows under constant assault from our neighbor. An awkward 15-minute wait for relocation was our prelude to dining, despite a sparsely populated venue.

The ambiance struck a high note, with Broadway memorabilia adorning the walls, a nod to the theater lovers like ourselves. Yet, as the sparse bread service vanished, our hopes for attentive service dimmed with no encore in sight.

My anticipation for the eggplant parmigiana, a personal favorite, was met with a tough, over-breaded disappointment, though the side vegetables did provide some solace. My friend's cheese ravioli fared better, seemingly the sole highlight of our culinary script.

While the restaurant may have its fans, it seems the performance we attended didn't merit a return visit. In a city filled with Italian encores, we'll be auditioning a different venue next time.",1

I got the vegetarian and it was absolutely delicious - the broth was super yummy and all the toppings were wonderful. I also got the sake lime cocktail, which was an excellent balance of tart and sweet, and I thought it was a great deal at only $7. I would highly recommend this and I would go again in a heartbeat.",0
11701,"Title: A Cozy Brunch Haven with a Gleeful Gluten-Free Embrace

My recent visit to this charming eatery for Sunday brunch was an absolute delight, offering a sanctuary for gluten-free diners like myself. The bread basket, while modest in size for its $4 price tag, arrived warm and inviting, though I did miss the balm of balsamic alongside the olive oil dip. It was the poached eggs with bacon, however, that stole the show – a dish so dreamy, it lingers in memory long after the meal.

The ambiance strikes a warm note with tasteful Italian decor and family photos adding to the cozy vibe. A word to the wise: mind your step (and head!) when heading to the rather petite restroom facilities downstairs.

On the note of family-friendliness, there's a hint of room for improvement. Little ones may find themselves without a high chair, and serving juice in a glass strikes me as an oversight in catering to the toddler crowd.

Service was friendly, yet could benefit from a touch more attentiveness; a proactive offer of condiments and refills would be a welcome tweak.

In essence, this place is a gem that warrants a return visit, especially for those perfect poached eggs. With slight enhancements in service and child accommodations, it could easily become a top pick for families and foodies alike.",1
19427,"Title: A Gluten-Free Haven with Flavorful Surprises

I recently dined at an exceptional restaurant that truly understands how to delight customers with dietary restrictions. As someone who often struggles to find a decent gluten-free pizza, I was blown away by their offering. The pizza was indistinguishable from traditional pies, resembling a gourmet flatbread, with a taste that knocked it out of the park.

We ordered the ""Funghi e Cipolle"" and were pleasantly surprised. The generous heap of onions and mushrooms created a perfect balance between sweet and savory - a testament to the kitchen's skill. We also tried the ""Spezie"" which was tasty, but for those who love heat, you might find it a tad mild.

In conclusion, this restaurant is a fantastic spot that I'm already eager to revisit. For gluten-free pizza lovers and food enthusiasts alike, you're in for a treat!",1
1595,"Title: A Culinary Gem on the Upper East Side

As a culinary aficionado searching for authentic Indian cuisine amidst the bustling streets of the Upper East Side, I have found my sanctuary at Agra. The restaurant offers a warm embrace with its incredibly friendly and accommodating staff, ensuring a comfortable dining experience with every visit.

Their lunch specials are both amazing and affordable, striking a chord with budget-conscious epicureans. A highlight is their naan bread infused with garlic, a fragrant delight that deserves every bit of praise. The chicken curry, a staple in Indian cuisine, is cooked to perfection here, offering a rich and flavorful reprieve from the usual NYC fare of sushi, pizza, and burgers.

Agra’s ambiance adds to its allure; ascending the stairs, one is transported into an Indian enclave, surrounded by intricate decorations, vivid paintings, and traditional table settings. Its location provides a unique vantage point over Lexington Avenue, allowing diners to engage in people-watching while indulging in their meals.

As a frequent visitor when attending Hunter College, Agra has become my go-to dining spot. It stands out as not just a restaurant but a cultural experience, a cherished place where memories are made over plates of delectable cuisine. I eagerly anticipate my next visit to this Indian culinary treasure.",1

My visit to Hou Yi Hot Pot was a tale of two experiences. The highlight? An impressive free drink selection boasting Yakult, teas, and unique offerings like Chrysanthemum and Lychee Tea—a refreshment haven that alone earns them a solid three stars.

But let's get to the heart of the matter—the hot pot. Despite the enticing name, Hou Yi's hot pot left my taste buds underwhelmed. For a dish that should sing with robust flavors, it was disappointingly bland and came with a steep price tag that didn't match the quality. To add insult to injury, I suspect it led to a bout of food poisoning, casting a further shadow on the culinary experience.

The ambience was average, a middle-of-the-road 3 out of 5, while service was commendable with a 4 out of 5, but the core offering—food—scraped by with a mere 2 out of 5. If your priority is a flavorful hot pot experience, I'd recommend looking elsewhere. But if it's the novelty of unlimited free drinks you're after, Hou Yi might just hit the spot. Though, you might want to consider a trip to Hmart for your beverage fix instead.",1

The wild mushroom quesadilla, oozing with cheese, was a tasty highlight and didn't disappoint. However, the elote did not meet expectations, as it was merely standard corn with a sprinkling of cheese, lacking the bold flavors one would anticipate. The salsa served alongside provided a spicy kick, primarily due to an abundance of jalapeños, but otherwise, it was unremarkable. Service was attentive and pleasant, contributing to the overall positive experience. While the food shows promise, there is certainly room for enhancement in terms of flavor and creativity.",1

Having visited a Black Tap location previously, I came in with high expectations. Unfortunately, this visit didn't quite hit the mark. I opted for the Old Fashioned Burger hoping for a succulent, medium-cooked patty but was met with something tipping towards well-done, which compromised the taste. On a brighter note, the substitution of regular fries with sweet potato fries for an additional $2 was a delightful decision—they were delicious and generous in portion.

The star of the show had to be their extravagant milkshakes. Despite the steep starting price of $15, the Brooklyn Blackout I indulged in was a chocolate lover's dream, complete with two hearty brownies - it's definitely made for sharing. While the burger left something to be desired, the milkshake still makes Black Tap a worthwhile indulgence.",1

During a recent city outing with my daughter, we stumbled upon Mr. Biggs Bar and Grill and decided to give it a try. Right from the start, the welcoming hostess made a great first impression by promptly seating us at a comfortably small, high-tabled setting.

The restaurant had a tempting $4 beer special, and although I'm not usually a beer drinker, the Stella Artois I tried was surprisingly pleasing. My daughter stuck with a classic Sprite.

As for the main event, I ventured into new culinary territory with the Juicy Lucy burger, a delightful twist with American cheese oozing from the inside. It lived up to its name and truly was a juicy, mouthwatering treat, perfectly paired with some outstanding French fries. My daughter, who's quite the discerning young diner, went for the cheese quesadillas and gave her seal of approval—especially given her eagerness to share my fries, which speaks volumes about their quality.

Our hostess doubled as our server, and she maintained her initial charm throughout our meal with her friendly, polite, and efficient service.

Mr. Biggs Bar and Grill won us over with its warm atmosphere, delightful drinks, and scrumptious food. It's a certainty that this spot will be on our dining agenda next time we're in the neighborhood.",1
1836,A friend recommended Joe Allen and Orso to us. We were also told it's the same owner for both restaurants. We dined at Orso the evening before and loved the food and had a lovely experience. We had high expectations for this restaurant. The host was nice and friendly so everything started great. We ordered A Caesar salad which was good. Chicken with Brussels sprout - the Brussels sprouts were really good. Chicken was just ok. The Branzino wasn't that great which was so disappointing because Orso's branzino was delicious. None of us finished our food. We ordered 1 hamburger plain and 1 cheeseburger (cheddar cheese on the side) both medium well for the kids. The hamburger and fries was fine. The 1st cheeseburger came out with Swiss cheese on it. The 2nd burger came out and it was very rare (see photo). The restaurant was very busy as people came to dine before a broadway show so we weren't able to get the burger fixed. The kids finished their fries as least. The waitress was great and was apologetic. Maybe we just came at the wrong time. I'd definitely go back to Orso!! It was amazing there.,0
2134,"Came here under the suggestion of my brother who felt this was the best pizza of his entire life! So naturally, I had high expectations. I came here with only 40 minutes as I had a show later in the evening. I was seated immediately. The seating is very small, I nudged the table sitting next to me while attempting to get to my side of the booth. Service was fast. Pizza was tasty, crust was fluffy yet light. Good amount of sausage on the picture below. Wine was over priced. Service was exceptional. Would recommend this pizza spot!",0
17561,"Festive interior. Tasty food!I'm not sure why the reviews are so extreme. I have been Twix wand have great experiences both times. The service has always been cheery and attentive. Perhaps the diners were just having bad days. The interior is immensely colorful and is a real pick me up. No literally. I wanted someone to pick me up so I could snatch a piñata. We started with passion fruit margaritas which were good. Not very strong but the passion fruit was perfect. The chorizo fundido and the nachos followed. I loveeed both. Stars of the show. But save room for the mains. We got the beef burrito and the chicken fajitas. To be honest we were so full that we didn't have the ability to fully taste what was going on. We were in good coma already. The fajitas came out sizzling. I liked those more than the burrito. By dessert we were at the brim. Tried the flan and then brought the empanada home- well, actually found someone who could put to use the nice little snack. Overall a fun place. Great service. Food is a solid 4/5 for sure.",0
10345,"I wanted to try their signature dish, the kimchi cream udon noodles. While I did enjoy the independent elements for the most part, there was an abundance of sauce which made the dish too salty. If it wasn't for that it would have been perfectly balanced.",0
12517,"Visited the much-hyped steakhouse about a week ago with tempered expectations. Decided on the 8oz filet mignon, medium with green veggies on the side. Surprisingly, the steak’s portion appeared closer to 6oz – an unexpected shortfall. Rather than the juicy medium, it arrived over-charred, sporting an aggressive pepper crust, and proved challenging to slice into – a stark difference from the ease of cutting found at top-notch steakhouses. Side greens were passable, nothing notable. A saving grace was the well-crafted old fashioned, paired with commendable service. Unfortunately, the overall experience fell short of the acclaim; it's not a steakhouse I'd rank among the finest.",1
16677,"My boyfriend surprised me with this amazing omakase dinner, so grateful. Greeted by a glass of champagne. We were both blown away how fresh, luscious and melt in your mouth the food was. Every piece of food was delicious and gorgeously plated. From the small dishes to the generous plate of sashimi to mini shabu shabu to the various sushi's to the hand roll and lastly the dessert. It's definitely a splurge but if you can go, please do yourself a favor and eat!",0
15460,I came here with a couple of girlfriends.  We ordered one of everything on the menu.  It is a small place but with large windows that make it feel very bright.  The menu is also small and specific.  It only didn't get 5 stars because we were seated near the kitchen and it was very hot.  We loved the specialty bread with the egg.  The salad with white beans was great and the chicken was cooked very well.  I wasn't crazy about the fish but don't care for that particular kind.  We also had the olive oil cake for dessert which was great.  The restaurant was not very busy while we were there.  We were able to comfortably sit and enjoy our time.  The waiter was great continually checking in and keeping water glasses filled.  We also had a celebrity sighting here but I won't say who!,0
13065,"On a rain-drenched day, we found solace in a steaming bowl of pho at a cozy little eatery with high tables and bar seats. The menu, refreshingly straightforward, featured just four types of pho. Our choices included one with rare beef and another with well-done beef. Straying from tradition, the pho arrived solo, without the usual accompaniments of bean sprouts, lime, and jalapeño pepper.

The broth's flavor struck a pleasing balance, not tipping the scales with excessive saltiness or the dreaded MSG-induced thirst. My rare beef pho hit the spot perfectly. However, my mom's experience was less satisfactory; the cooked beef in her bowl was fragmented into tiny slivers, detracting from her enjoyment.

An unexpected perk presented itself at the end of our meal—a kind 10% lunchtime discount. Despite the minor hiccups, the restaurant was a haven on a soggy day, offering a simple, comforting meal.",1
1321,"Title: A Celestial Dining Experience at the Sky Box

Review:

From the moment we ascended to the Sky Box, an exclusive perch overlooking the kitchen of this Michelin 2-star culinary heaven, we knew we were in for an unrivaled epicurean journey. Describing the evening as the ""best meal of our lives"" seems almost an understatement.

Our encounter commenced with a warm greeting from the chef, a culinary maestro whose graciousness shone as brightly as his kitchen's flames. His willingness to engage with us and snap a few cherished photographs fostered a personal touch that set the tone for the night.

The service was nothing short of stellar. The staff orchestrated our dining experience with a symphony of impeccable timing and discreet attention to detail, ensuring our every need was anticipated and met.

The pièce de résistance was a bespoke multi-course menu that defied expectations. Each dish was thoughtfully designed for both the gentlemen and ladies, a nod to traditional sensibilities that resonated with all in our party. Paired exquisitely with a selection of fine French wines, our palates were taken on an adventure that danced between innovation and time-honored classics.

In short, this was not merely a meal but a culinary odyssey to be etched in memory and savored long after the last course. Let there be no doubt, a dining experience at the Sky Box is one to place at the pinnacle of your bucket list.",1
20250,"Title: A Slurp-Worthy Endeavor – Ramen Excellence at its Best

If you're a ramen aficionado, this Japanese originated restaurant specializing in IEKEI-style ramen is a must-visit. Their signature blend of tonkatsu and shoyu broths strikes a delightful balance – lighter than Ippudo's yet carrying more heft than the typical miso or shoyu variants. Be warned, it leans towards the salty end of the spectrum, but the flavors are so compelling you'll likely find yourself savoring most of the soup.

The EAK ramen, featuring their house noodles, stands out with its satisfying thickness and ideal chewiness. Paired with tender chashu pork, it's a hearty and gratifying bowl. My companions relished the Zebra ramen, and while the takoyaki was satisfying, an extra piece or two would have been welcome.

Happy hour here is a boon, with attractively priced beers and a selection of drinks like the frozen sake, which, albeit a tad watery, couldn't overshadow the overall pleasing experience. Their mini-bowls tease the palate, and a lunchtime deal adds to the appeal. With promising vegetarian options hinted at, this is a spot I'm eager to return to.",1
11640,"Title: A Last-Minute Win at the Market!

We stumbled upon this gem at the market and were pleasantly surprised; it's definitely the best pick among the food stalls. Their kimchi fries were a standout—a delightful twist on a classic favorite with a spicy Korean kick that didn't disappoint. The tangy kimchi paired perfectly, giving the fries an extra flavor boost. 

But the star of the show was the hoduk—crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside, stuffed with savory pork, and served with a kimchi dipping sauce that complemented it beautifully. If you find yourself at the market, make sure to give this place a try; it's a fantastic choice for a quick, delicious bite.",1
11111,"I had high hopes for this restaurant, but unfortunately, my experience fell short of expectations. The service was confusing and unprofessional; staff seemed unsure of the ordering process, which led to a frustrating back-and-forth between the counter and the cashier. The food was also a letdown – they were out of white rice, and the alternative, brown rice, was disappointingly undercooked and hard. To make matters worse, the chicken was dry and lacked flavor. Overall, a disheartening visit that didn't live up to the potential I had anticipated.",1
2475,"The noodles weren't too memorable, and the service was crappy, but what stood out especially for our kids (we travelled with another family so there were 5 kids), were the Fried Dumplings. The kids had 8 orders (24 dumplings total), and they asked for another couple orders in addition to that to take back to the hotel for dinner. They're made with some sort of marinated beef and lightly fried so there's a little crunch. Yummmmmmmmy cannot describe them, but maybe ""addictive"" would... Our friends went back on our last day to get a couple orders for the plane ride home lol!",0
10652,"Freshly made guac here was delicious, but the spicy one was not spicy at all and I had to ask for extra spicy. Pan Seared Salmon medium rare was perfectly cooked but the base green sauce was too salty .. Elote the sauce came with it was also overly done. Cocktails took forever to arrive during lunch hour",0
13222,"From the moment we stepped into this gem situated at the skating level of Rockefeller Center, we knew we were in for a treat. The ambience set the stage for what turned out to be a marvelous dining experience, earning a well-deserved 5 out of 5 stars.

The service was simply impeccable. Kudos to the attentive waiter with the distinctive glasses and neatly parted dark hair. Though his name escaped us, his pride in delivering exceptional service did not go unnoticed.

The culinary adventure was just as delightful. The crab cakes, as per my boyfriend's enthusiastic approval, were incredible, while my surf and turf—a playful twist on the classic with short ribs and scallops—hit all the right notes of succulent perfection.

Each appetizer and side dish complemented the meal further, cementing this dining occasion as not just a meal, but a truly memorable experience.",1
21013,"Title: Canal Street's Hidden Gem for Pizza Lovers

If you find yourself craving pizza on Canal Street, look no further than this unassuming gem. This go-to pizzeria defies the old 'you get what you pay for' adage, offering tantalizing slices without breaking the bank. In a world where prices are soaring, getting a couple of slices for just over two dollars feels like a steal.

Don't let the modest size of the venue fool you; what it lacks in space, it makes up for in flavor. Each slice boasts a harmonious balance of cheese and sauce—neither skimped on nor overdone—and the crust strikes the perfect chord between crunchiness and chewiness.

In a market saturated with subpar budget eats, this spot stands out for delivering affordable pizza that actually tastes good. It's not every day you stumble upon such a rare find. Make sure to take advantage of it when you do.",1
20707,"Babu Ji has some great Indian food! And if you are in the Union Square are I strongly suggest checking it out.I came here for dinner back last Saturday with my husband, we were told by a friend to give the place a try and boy am I glad we did! The drinks and food were great. We started our meal with the ""the Original"" naan pizza which had so much flavor a mix of sweet with a little spice. For our main dishes I had the unauthentic butter chicken(vegetarian/paneer) my husband had the mountaire farm chicken; both dishes were simply delicious a burst of flavor in our mouths.The service was a bit slow, however, it was most likely due to how consistently buy the place is.I would definitely come back and try some of the other items on the menu.Thanks for a good evening out Babu Ji!",0
10325,"Title: A Mussel Lover's Happy Hour Delight

I recently visited a restaurant that rekindled my love affair with mussels. Their happy hour, while limited to bar or counter seating, is an absolute steal – a generous portion of mussels with perfectly crisped fries for just $24. Opting for the classic in white wine sauce did not disappoint; the sauce was a dream for bread-dipping, and the staff happily provided refills on the bread.

The only drawback was the noise level, as the bar area can get quite crowded. For those seeking a calmer dining experience, the tables in the back offer a much nicer ambience, although devoid of the happy hour specials. Despite this, the quality of the meal and the deal were too good to pass up.",1
10768,"I love brunch and have very high expectations when I go out. Being as I do not get to go very often. That being said I'm kinda satisfied with Jane. Here we go:We had reservations at 11. Jeffrey was running a little late but the hostess was nice enough to seat us even though our party wasn't complete. For the three of us we ordered two Jane Benedicts, Vanilla bean french toast, the Jane burger, apple smoked bacon, cappuccinos, cucumber ginger refresher and a bottle of Saratoga sparkling water. The Jane benedict was delicious, the burger looked amazing. Jeffrey said it tasted just as good as it looked. But the star of the show was the vanilla bean french toast. Omg. It was amazing. Sweet but not overly so. The toast itself was cooked perfectly.  I could eat that everyday. Now to the three things I really didn't care for: The apple smoked bacon. It was just normal bacon. Wasn't the best nor the worst. Just eh. The cucumber refresher. I honestly didn't like this. It had no real pizazz. The cappuccinos. They were small, weak, and had no real foam. All that being said. I highly recommend Jane. And I will definitely be back!!",0
2987,"Good Italian food.Came here with a group of friends for a birthday dinner. Everything was really good. We ordered the calamari, meatballs, pear salad, and truffle fries for starters. I liked the pear salad best. The goat cheese went well with the pear and dressing. For entrees we did family style and got the pesto pasta, lasagne, fettuccine amore (squid ink pasta), fiocchi porcini and roast duck. The roast duck, fiocchi porcini and squid ink pasta were our favorites. The fiocchi porcini and squid ink pasta are a little on the rich side, but they're so good and flavorful. The pesto was very fresh, but it think it needed a little more flavor, it was a little on the bland side. The lasagne was also good, but the other dishes over powered it.Lastly we shared a tiramisu, which was also delicious. Light fluffy and not overly sweet like it should be. Overall verything was good and I'd order them again.",0
11122,"Title: A Bustling Hub for Casual Group Hangouts

If you're searching for a spirited spot to decompress with colleagues or a last-minute hangout with friends, this energetic establishment checks the box. However, it's far from the tranquil dinner setting you'd pick for a family gathering with your mom or grandma. 

The ambiance is characterized by its clamor and dim lighting – creating a particular mood that's not everyone's cup of tea. We sampled the flatbread and charcuterie board; while on the pricier side, the quality, especially the surprisingly savory flatbread, justifies splitting the cost among friends. 

Service is standard, in line with the venue's laid-back, almost frenetic vibe, rather than the attentive care of a fine dining experience. Perfect for those seeking a retreat from the nearby bustle of Times Square, it's a solid choice for a communal outing.",1
15045,"The noodles are good but for $24, I think I'll have to pass and go to Toto. If you do decide to try, I'd recommend a medium or above for the spice level. They ended up being a little more mild than I'd expect so go a step up for what you'd usually pick. As for wait time, we were able to walk in on a Sunday at prime lunch hour (12:30pm) with two people and no wait. That was great but not sure how long that will last.Also, no cash is accepted - just card.",0
14538,"Solid 4! We stopped by around 9pm on a Saturday and was able to get a table outside. Awesome people watching. Our waiter was a bit slow to start but was helpful as the evening went on. We each had a class of wine and tried the meatballs, burrata and the rockaway (vodka pie) - meatballs were ok, the burrata was delicious and the pizza was good! I must warn you though it was spicy- spicy in a good way but nonetheless spicy. The menu doesn't say it has a kick so we weren't expecting it. This is a great location and I recommend if you're in the area. They also do take reservations as well!",0
1205,"The expire experience is amazing! We get there around 1:30 and only waited for 30 minutes. While you are waiting here, you can order cocktails to kill time.

Walk in to the dining area, they don't have a lot tables and the design are simple, u can hear all the waiters will greet u with Japanese. Love it. Feel special lol After we get seated, water, menu, everything's set. I ordered noodle and also their yuzu martini. The drink is sooo good, very fresh, and the noodle is amazing. The service is good, they are friendly and efficient. I heard someone will say that the waiters will try to push u to leave then they can service the next customer, but we stayed like 20 minutes.

19138,"Tucked away from the bustling city, this Thai restaurant remains one of my favorites, despite its remote location. During my visits, I've had the chance to sample several dishes.

The kao soy scored a 7/10. As my first foray into noodle soups, it didn't quite hit the mark. I anticipated more oomph from this curry-ish creation but found it surprisingly mild and complex, with a myriad of ingredients that overwhelmed my palate.

In stark contrast, the clay pot rice is a revelation. A flawless 10/10. This dish is a medley of succulent seafood, tender meats, and earthy mushrooms, all paired with sticky rice that carries the flavors beautifully. It's a must-have and a dish I'll crave every time I return.

The massaman curry, while standard, earned a solid 8/10. It's a familiar comfort, and although it didn't break new ground, my affinity for massaman means I'll reorder in the future.

Similarly, the similan curry received an 8/10. It's a milder cousin to the red curry, unspectacular yet satisfyingly savory. For those seeking heat, it doesn't raise the temperature but offers a pleasant, rich taste.

Lastly, the tom yum soup did not disappoint. Another 8/10, this dish provided a generous helping complete with an abundance of mushrooms—sheer delight for any tom yum aficionado.

In conclusion, while the restaurant has room for improvement in certain areas, standout dishes like the clay pot rice ensure I'll be coming back for more.",1
20890,"I had the pleasure of dining at this Southeast Asian gem showcasing Malaysian and Singaporean flavors, nestled in an inviting basement-style space in Chinatown. The cuisine was delicious and authentic, with the entrees capturing the essence of the region, although portions weren't particularly generous for the price point. Service could have been sharper; our appetizer briefly went astray before finding its way to our table. It's by no means the cheapest option around, yet the quality of the food justifies the expense. A nice touch was the Yelp check-in offer, rewarding us with a delightful small Thai tea that perfectly complemented the meal. Whether you're a connoisseur of Southeast Asian food or looking to expand your palate, the culinary experience here is worth a try.",1
20004,"Title: Delightful Lunch with Swift Service

My friend and I decided to try out this restaurant for lunch and were pleasantly surprised by the immediate seating upon arrival. We ventured into the appetizer section, settling on Pad Thai and another main dish from the lunch specials, both coming with the option of a salad or additional appetizer.

Our wine and first course arrived swiftly, and while we were still enjoying it, the main dishes made their entrance, a testament to the kitchen's efficiency. The flavors of each dish were spot-on, a perfect blend of savory and aromatic that had us savoring every bite.

The restaurant's ambience added to the experience, striking a balance between elegance and comfort. Service was attentive, tipping towards zealous with a keen eye on dish turnover. It was clear they aimed to maintain a cleared table, perhaps a shade too eagerly.

In summary, this establishment offers a wonderful dining experience with delectable food and brisk service. Although we felt a tad rushed, the overall quality ensures that we'll be returning for another meal.",1
16144,"I am not a huge pasta fan but this place really changed my mind.  Such a cute and quaint establishment near hell's kitchen.  Had a homey feel, dimly lit, and tables are very close to each other however it doesn't feel crowded.  Service was absolutely incredible.Ok my dish literally brought tears to my eyes.  The Veal tagliatelle has got to be in the top 10 things I've tasted.  Pasta was al dente and just a burst of flavor!  I cannot praise this dish enough!  We started off with a beat salad that was just too good for words.Very intimate place, perfect for date night!",0
17524,"Title: A Mixed Experience at a Bustling Spanish Market

I recently visited a market renowned for its Spanish culinary offerings. While the food has its merits, the overall experience fell short of my expectations.

On the positive side, the potato tortilla received an 8/10 for its delightful melting interior encased in a well-cooked omelet. The cheese and meat platter also scored an 8/10, boasting a commendable variety, though the accompaniment of cookies rather than a traditional baguette was a letdown.

The paella, however, only managed a 7/10. It lacked the cherished socarrat—a crispy layer of rice at the bottom of the pan—that aficionados often seek out.

Despite the tasty offerings, dining here comes with caveats. It's a crowded and rather pricey market, with an environment that can be described as chaotic and confusing. Seating is inadequate, with a disproportionate number of standing tables. I found myself wandering with a $50 cheese plate and wine in hand, ultimately relegated to standing and eating—a less than ideal situation.

In conclusion, while there are certainly some good Spanish dishes to be sampled, the discomfort and inconvenience may detract from the overall enjoyment.",1
10217,"I made a 6p reservation here for my boyfriend's birthday and had a lovely time. I was a little early and was sat at one of the tall tables next to the bar. Near it were a few booths nestled on the side, each slightly enclosed and up a couple steps -- surprisingly private nooks inside an otherwise busy restaurant. I wanted one!  So I walked back to the hostess and asked if we could sit at one of the booths instead. They were all reserved for 7p, but said we were welcome to sit at one as long as we were out by then, so we did! I very much appreciated her allowing it. For dinner we decided to order a few appetizers to share: tuna poke, pepperoni flatbread, and pork belly sliders. I personally wasn't a big fan of the tuna, but the flatbread and sliders were delicious. For drink I had a glass of prosecco and he had an old fashioned -- no complaints there.At the end of the meal I was expecting a little birthday treat with a candle for my bf. The hostess even mentioned it when I checked in and said they would bring him a cookie skillet. Unfortunately, we never got it and I felt too awkward asking about it. Super disappointing.The next day I received a thank you email from Chris the GM welcoming any feedback, so I decided to respond telling him about what happened. He was quick to respond, and invited us to come back along with a discount off our next bill. A couple weeks later I took him up on his offer, and I'm so glad we did.He reserved us a couple seats at the bar, and we had an awesome time. We had the cacio y pepe flatbread, which was to die for, good fries, and some delicious sangiovese. Chris made a point to introduce himself and apologize again in person, and even sent out cookie skillet dessert for us on the house at the end.Talk about going above and beyond for your customers.

16001,"Title: Speedy Delivery and Tasty Treats from Patzeria

I recently opted for delivery from Patzeria and must commend their promptness; the meal arrived sooner than anticipated, which was a delightful surprise. The packaging impressed me with its neatness, ensuring everything stayed hot and intact.

The chicken parm with penne was the highlight of my order. While the chicken was slightly dry, the flavor was spot on, and the cheesy overlay was mouthwateringly generous. Accompanied by a fresh, non-acidic marinara sauce, the dish was a comforting hit. The penne was perfectly al dente, just how I like it.

Garlic lovers will find solace in Patzeria’s offerings, as the complimentary garlic bread was a tasty treat, and the inclusion of extra parm and red pepper flakes was a thoughtful touch that added a personalized kick to the meal. 

The garlic knots, bursting with fresh garlic and an aromatic mix of herbs, were good but left me yearning for either a more even distribution of garlic or perhaps smaller knots that could better integrate the flavors. 

Overall, the pricing was reasonable for the generous portions, making for a satisfying experience. Patzeria has definitely earned a repeat customer in me, particularly for their chicken parm.",1
1978,"It's been a while since I've done a review and I need to get back into it. I recently traveled to New York and stayed at the Arlo Soho. I chose this hotel based more on location since it was only about a five-minute walk to our office, but I'm really glad I did. The staff here was very helpful and the hotel is what I would consider chic. The room was very small as is typical when you stay in New York, but it was tastefully decorated and must have been renovated recently since everything looked very new and in good condition. I chose a courtyard view as opposed to a City view.They offered free appetizers the night of check-in as well as music in the courtyard. There was nothing extraordinary about the stay, other than as mentioned before it was very clean the staff was very polite. The location is great as Soho is Central to just about everything. You can take a short subway ride and be in times square, or anywhere else.My rating system consists of a 3-star being exactly what you expected and neither good nor bad. A 4 means something was extra special and a 5 means you were blown away.  A 2 star rating was disappointing and a 1-star rating is terrible",0
3445,"The restaurant has two floors and is situated inside a hotel. The top floor was surrounded with bookcases. Overall service was good, the General Manager was knowledgeable and was helpful in narrowing our choices. In addition, we took advantage of wine pairing option which was $15 for NYC restaurant week brunch. Now to the meal: Appetizer: We ordered the arancini. The arancini serving was made for sharing. I only ate three and I was already full. The appetizer was cooked to perfection in terms of authenticity. Therefore, definitely got my money's worth with this choice.- Entree: We ordered the Chicken Milanese which was huge. The taste and texture of the chicken was on point. When combined with the cheese, tomatoes, arugula and balsamic vinaigrette it was one of the most perfect bite I have had in a long time. The dish was so huge I took it to go and had it for dinner. Definitely a dish worth getting. Awesome food and portion size. Definite hidden gem. Can't wait to return for happy hour and will be returning for a private holiday party.",0

2889,"Title: Solid Sicilian Slice, But Hype Exceeds Taste

I recently visited the much-hyped spot known for its Sicilian style pizza, and the experience was, in a word, decent. The pizza here is notably saucy and oily, which does lend to a more flavor-packed bite. However, these characteristics alone weren't enough to set it apart from other Sicilian pizzas I've tasted. 

The value proposition can be a bit tricky; the classic pepperoni slice will set you back $4.50 with cash, but card users beware—an added fee pushes the price up to around $5. Although the price felt steep at first glance, the generous sizing of each thick slice makes it more justifiable.

Convenience played a big role in my overall satisfaction. Had I been subjected to the notorious lines, my rating would've dipped to three stars. Luckily, my line-free experience edged that rating up to four stars. 

For those curious about this style of pizza, this place is worth a shot, provided you temper expectations and prepare for the potential extra cost if swiping a card. While you won't find me raving about it, it's a worthwhile stop for a sizeable and robust piece of Sicilian pizza.",1

18719,"I recently visited a local restaurant with friends for a late dinner around 10:30 PM on a Saturday. Despite the crowd, we only had to wait about 10 minutes for a table. The interior was spacious, although the tables felt a bit crammed together. The night started with ""Texas sized"" frozen drinks which, while good, didn't quite live up to their name in terms of size.

For appetizers, we shared an order of sticky wings—delicious, though we initially received one fewer than ordered. This was eventually rectified by our waiter. My main course consisted of salmon and grilled shrimp, and I was disappointed I couldn't upgrade to pineapple shrimp despite its presence on the menu as another dish. Sides were a choice of rice, fries, salad, or baked potato; we all selected salad, which experienced a delay in service.

Due to time constraints, we had to request our entrees to-go, which unnecessarily prolonged our experience. Communication about the delay was unclear and fell short of satisfactory. Upon eating our takeout, I found my meal to include pineapples, adding to the confusion of earlier. Unfortunately, the pita served with my meal was soggy from sauce due to improper packaging.

To cap it off, our waiter added an 18% tip to the bill without justification, as we were not a large party. Overall, the dining experience was marred by service mishaps and moderate satisfaction with the food. I'm left uncertain about the possibility of a return visit.",1

After an initial underwhelming visit to [Restaurant Name], an invitation to give it another chance proved to be a delightful surprise. The server's expertise shined as they intricately described the dish preparations and cocktail ingredients, showcasing a commendable knowledge spectrum.

Skepticism over the cuisine vanished with each savory course. Both taste and presentation were impeccable, and I've captured some of these culinary delights in updated photographs.

Even with a bustling atmosphere and nearly full house, noise levels were remarkably subdued compared to my previous visit, allowing for a more enjoyable dining experience. The front of house staff was a step above: attentive, efficient, and courteous right through our departure.

The transformation was impressive, convincing me that [Restaurant Name] merits future visits. Here's to hoping for consistency in this newfound excellence.",1
10087,"Title: A Chinatown Gem for Noodle Lovers

I recently returned to one of my top picks in Chinatown, especially when craving some comforting noodles. Opting for my usual favorite choice, I tried the beef stir-fried knife cut noodles. The noodles were exemplary in their chewy texture, delivering that heartwarming homemade feel I adore. Paired with succulent beef, eggs, and an array of veggies, the dish was a flavorful delight.

My companions indulged in the beef hand-pull noodle soup and an assortment of dumplings, each receiving nods of approval for taste. What heightens the appeal of this locale is the affordability factor, with most dishes priced at or below $10, making it a haven for those seeking an inexpensive yet delectable meal.

In sum, this restaurant consistently impresses with its delicious, budget-friendly offerings. Whether you're a fan of knife-cut or hand-pulled noodles, or in the mood for some savory dumplings, this spot is definitely worth a visit.",1

I recently had the pleasure of hosting a dinner for six at this remarkable restaurant. Despite our early arrival, the staff was impressively accommodating. The hostess greeted us warmly, setting the tone for an evening of exceptional service.

The culinary offerings were nothing short of awesome. The appetizers are a must-try, with the calamari standing out as particularly delectable. A highlight was the veal scaloppine, a special for the evening, which was undeniably savory and cooked to perfection.

Capping off the meal with a well-prepared cappuccino was a delightful touch. Post-dinner, we enjoyed the luxury of lingering over conversation without feeling rushed, a testament to the restaurant's commitment to a relaxed dining experience.

17310,"I was walking passed one day when a woman was handing out free mini samples of their beef empanadas. I made it all the way to the corner of the block before turning around to immediately buy a full size one. These are really, really good. The batter is not greasy, it's texture is flaky and sturdy at the corners, soft and yielding in the center. The beef is juicy and flavorful. I was once given a chicken empanada by mistake, and at first I was upset, because who the hell would want chicken over beef? But maaaan those were really good too! I'm not familiar with Cuban food, so I can't tell you what spices are used in either, but they're different from each other and are so good. They also come with a green sauce that's only very gently spicy, and while I always use it the empanadas are so good they can easily be eaten plain.This place is hectic and packed during lunch, and there's a good amount of seating in the back. I see more men in here than I do women, every construction worker seems to seek this place out for the hearty food and large portions. They have daily specials in addition to their usual offerings, oxtail being one of them!I ordered the Ropa Vieja, shredded beef stew with peppers and onions, a side of rice and beans, and a side salad that comes with onions, peppers, and carrots. The meat could have been a little more tender, I always like it when it melts in your mouth but it wasn't tough. The red sauce was tasty, you could really taste the vegetables. While this might not be the very best, blow your mind meal, the quality and portion size for the price can't be beat. And they turn out the food fast while still remaining very friendly. In midtown lunch hell, this is a gem.",0
15990,"What a fun, unique dining experience! Spotted this place from another Yeep's review, and so glad I bookmarked Zauo for our NYC getaway. Clean decor, warmly lit interior, and multi-level fishing/catching/dining space. A mesmerizing vertical LCD screen display of aquarium-like footage welcomes you upon entering, along with the blue tank of rainbow trout & striped bass. Upper level tanks house the lobsters and flukes&flounders. As many others have said, you can choose to catch what you eat live and select various ways of prep: soft boiled, hard boiled and tempura for lobsters; tataki, grilled, sake steamed, soy simmered, and tempura for the fish. We had our lobster hard boiled, tempura'd, and miso souped; our rainbow trout sake steamed and tataki'd. Beautiful presentation and absolutely scrumptious!  We also got the wasabi tako and seaweed salad apps. Very very flavorful. Pricey but worth its special, one-of-a-kind dining experience!",0

15529,"Title: A Perfect Blend of Ambiance and Flavor at RetroWave Bistro

My experience at RetroWave Bistro was nothing short of delightful. The establishment boasts a cool vibe that seamlessly combines a sit-down dining area with a vibrant bar scene, catering to various moods and occasions. 

The music selection was a nostalgic throwback, featuring an eclectic mix of '80s slow jams and new wave hits that enhanced the dining experience without overwhelming conversation. It's a place where the ambiance strikes the right note, allowing you to enjoy both the sounds and your company.

When it came to the cuisine, each dish was a journey through intricate flavors, crafted to satisfy even the most discerning palate. Despite the smaller portions, the quality and richness of the food left me feeling both full and content.

The cocktail menu did not disappoint, with each drink being skillfully mixed and presented. In particular, the rosé on offer was a delightful complement to the meal—light and refreshing.

The lighting added a touch of romance to the surroundings, yet the atmosphere remained inviting and casual, perfect for a night out with friends. It's a rare gem that allows for intimate dinners and group gatherings where you can actually hear each other talk.

In conclusion, RetroWave Bistro nails the combination of superb food, engaging music, and a welcoming environment. It's definitely on my list for future outings.",1
1964,"Title: Underwhelming Dining Experience at Overpriced Eatery

Unfortunately, my recent visit to the unnamed restaurant left much to be desired. The establishment's pricing does not align with the value of straightforward dishes such as tacos and tamales, which is a substantial drawback for budget-conscious diners seeking authentic Mexican cuisine.

Service pacing further diminished the dining experience, with a protracted wait of half an hour for dishes as simple as nachos to arrive. This delay raises questions about kitchen efficiency, particularly when paired with the disappointing arrival of sweet potato fries that had lost their warmth, suggesting they had been neglected after preparation.

The saving grace of the meal was a sandwich enhanced by a generous serving of avocado; however, this was not enough to counterbalance the overall service issues, including the waitress's oversight of an order and lack of attentiveness throughout our stay.

Additionally, the cramped table space could be seen as reflective of the modest portion sizes, which might leave some guests still hungry after their meal. The promise of complimentary churros for checking in is a nice touch, yet it's not sufficient to eclipse the array of better Mexican food options available elsewhere. Patrons are advised to temper their expectations or seek alternative eateries for a more satisfying and well-rounded dining experience.",1
16870,"Came here with 3 other friends on a Saturday as we were craving korean bbq. We put our names down and ended up waiting about an hour for our table. Upon entering you have to climb up quite a long and narrow flight of stairs so not exactly the most accessible place to get to. On to the food. The four of us ordered the pork platter ($60) and the beef platter ($84) to share and of course a bottle of soju to go with all the food. The beef platter arrived first and was grilled to perfection for us. The meat was extremely tender and juicy, as well as extremely fresh. The pieces of steak were well marbled and thickly cut so when grilled it was the perfect bite. The pork platter was equally as amazing as the beef! Sometimes there's a bit of a smell to pork depending on how it's butchered as well as how fresh it is. It wasn't a problem here! The thick cuts of pork belly and other cuts of pork, which were just the right amount of fatty and all extremely juicy, satisfied our kbbq cravings! There weren't that many memorable banchan or side dishes, but that's not what we were there for! Excellent service all around, can't wait to go back!TLDR, Jongro is the place to go in Ktown if you're craving quality cuts of meat!

A word to the wise: don't step in on an empty stomach; your eyes will inevitably be bigger than your belly, particularly for those with a penchant for sweets. Amid a plethora of pastry options, I succumbed to a chocolate almond croissant. Each bite offered the perfect flaky texture, generously topped with almonds and harmoniously filled with rich dark chocolate and almond cream. Paired with an iced mocha, it was the quintessential afternoon indulgence, crowning a day of tourism with delicious satisfaction.",1

2266,"If this review was based on food alone the rating would definitely be a 4; however, simply due to the mess of the meal experience the day I arrived that rating had to be brought way down which is such a shame. I entered the restaurant with a friend around 7 PM on a Saturday night. We had called ahead to see what the wait time was like and we were told it would only be around a 10 minute wait. When we arrived, we were greeted by the grumpiest host I have ever seen who just told us he would ""remember us"" and did not make any note down that we were waiting. We realized after a few minutes that their computer system was down - but it was just strange they didn't even note it on paper or anything, definitely seems like things could become chaos from that kind of system which we realized it was about to become. We saw some open seats at the bar and decided to snag those up which was a great call because we realized after the dinner that a family that arrived a few minutes after us weren't seated for over an hour - by the time we left they hadn't even been seated yet. Additionally, those who had arrived before us weren't seated till 30 minutes after we found our spots.After we claimed our seats, we waited at least 10 minutes for someone to acknowledge our existence which never happened. During that time no one came over to give us some water or menus or simply just to check in. It wasn't until the host walked by that we were able to flag him down and get our glasses filled and be given a towel to clean our hands with. After that we waited another ten minutes before another server came over to take our order that was placed in the computer. That server was probably the only person who actually provided good customer service and though our interaction was brief it was memorable. The food itself came out pretty quickly but then service just went downhill again. There was one girl who just kept taking away my napkins when I was still using them, and after we were waiting for someone to come over to give us a box, this lady just comes and throws all of the plates on our food before we even had time to tell her about wanting some boxes. After we started to complain was when she decided to ask if we were done with our food and if we still wanted to keep it. Seriously after you threw trash on it you would still ask?? Just very unprofessional. We had ordered: --CALAMARI SINGAPURA: Such great flavor and the calamari was cooked perfectly - wonderfully nice and juicy. The texture of the dish was also delicious. --SINGAPORE CHILI CRAB: Flavor was yummy. However, going back to the service issue again we asked for the instruments that helped to crack open the crab shells and they kept not bringing it to us till like 10 ish minutes. It also took them the same amount of time to bring out the bao which was needed to finish the dish. --HAPPY SODA: Absolutely delicious - a much order --NASI LEMAK: The rice was ok. The beef had good flavor but was way too dry. The other sides were much better. All in all, though food and the interior decoration was good none of that could have saved the terrible service itself that just really pulled down the status of the restaurant. Most of the employees there really need to go through some more training or something because it was unacceptable especially in such a competitive restaurant market like New York.",0
13911,"Upon visiting a quaint Italian eatery nestled in the heart of Harlem, I was immediately charmed by its delightful interior.

The warmth of their hospitality paired nicely with the decent fare served, rounding out a very pleasant dining experience.",1
13606,"I went to Eat Gai to pickup dinner after work because we were craving chicken and rice. The booth was quick to order from and they have a reward system which is nice. I ordered a half boil chicken ($16) with an extra side of chicken ($6) because they didn't offer the full chicken option, the fried chicken and rice in a pineapple ($11.50), and Thai tea ($3). The portions were generous and the chicken was not dry. The fried chicken had a slightly sweet coating and the skin was tucked into the bartered part.  The boiled chicken wasn't as flavorful by itself and needed the soy sauce on top. Both of the rices were barely flavored as described and the Thai tea was pretty standard.  Overall, I would come back again if I was craving chicken rice and was in the area but I like the chicken rice location on 3rd ave and 45th more.",0

If anything, the food comes out too fast, of which we were forewarned.Everything was very tastefully plated. We started with two appetizers, the rotisserie chicken and banana blossom salad and the chopped lamb salad. Both were quite spicy (which I enjoyed) and loaded with flavor. For the main dishes, we chose the Khao Soi Kaa aki which was a delectable  egg noddle in curry. This was my favorite dish we tried. It was a delicious balance of curry, noodle, spice and creaminess. We also got the crab fried rice, which, although tasty, was rather simple. We definitely ordered too much food for just the two of us; would advise 2 apps and 1 entree or 2 entree and 1 app for 2. Overall, would definitely recommend. Although I had a wonderful dining experience here, I just can't say I was 'blown away' and for that I would dock a star, but, nonetheless, would return for some tasty bites.",0
1894,"Title: A Korean BBQ Experience Not to Be Missed

Review:
Upon the recommendation of Yelp, I discovered an exceptional Korean BBQ gem tucked away on the second floor that's easy to miss—but trust me, you'll want to find it. The moment the elevator doors open, the rich aroma of BBQ and the sound of vibrant music confirm you've left the streets of NY for a culinary escape.

Reservation is a must, and Yelp's waitlist feature is a saving grace for the inevitable queue. The staff here are the embodiment of hospitality, guiding you to a comfortable sitting area as you await that much-anticipated text to be seated.

My large party opted for the substantial meat platter complemented by kimchi soup and white rice sides. The attentive staff expertly cooked the meat on the grill right at our table, adding to the interactive dining experience. Each bite was a harmony of flavors, from the succulent BBQ to the fresh lettuce, bean sprout soup, onions, and even a delightful macaroni salad.

The trendy ambiance melds seamlessly with generous portions and mouth-watering tastes, making this spot not just a meal, but a must-do dining adventure.",1
14639,"Title: Vibrant Friday Farewell at the Bar

I recently visited this establishment strictly to experience the bar scene for a post-work celebration and farewell gathering with colleagues. Our group positioned ourselves at the corner of the bar, conveniently located by the entrance, which allowed for easy access and a great spot to take in the lively atmosphere.

Despite the busy Friday rush, the service was commendably swift – our drinks arrived promptly, ensuring our evening kicked off without a hitch. This was well-appreciated as my boss generously treated the team to a round of shots, and the fact that it coincided with happy hour meant the drinks were delightfully affordable, albeit with the less expensive liquors.

Although I didn't get the chance to try the cuisine, the bar's ambiance has piqued my interest in their Thai food offerings. The combination of the fast service, cheap drinks, and vibrant environment makes me eager to return, not just for the libations but also to indulge in their culinary delights on my next visit.",1
2984,We came here for dinner on Friday night with a reservation.  We have been a few times before and the food is good.  We were seated right away.  The restaurant itself is down some stairs and has a rustic vibe.  It is not a very loud place so it is great if you want to be able to hear and speak with your dining partners.  I had the kale and butternut squash salad with salmon and avocado.  I loved this salad it was very tasty and a good size.  We also shared the lamb meatballs as an appetizer.  I did come away with about 8 mosquito bites so I have taken off a star.,0

The staff were all very attentive and friendly.  We wanted to try their Cajun options, but I love blue crabs. Since I don't typically get to enjoy the east coast blue crabs, I had to order it. The snails were super yummy. They went light on the fish sauce, which is a bit too light for this Viet girl, but it was still very flavorful. I wish we came here with more people so we could try more dishes. The restrooms are clean and roomy, which is unusual for Manhattan Chinatown. The flavors were great, service was great, and the atmosphere was wonderful. Definitely worth a try in NYC.",0

Stumbling upon The Meatball Shop turned out to be a serendipitous dining adventure. Their inventive approach to a classic favorite impressed us from the get-go. The menu invites you to mix and match a variety of meatballs, sauces, and sides, crafting a personalized feast that seems to offer limitless delectable combinations. Originally our plan B due to a long wait elsewhere, this spot quickly stole the show. Each bite was a testament to their culinary creativity and commitment to flavor.

14023,"Tucked into a cozy corner, this quaint eatery boasts a welcoming bar at its front. Service is competent, though not particularly outstanding; adequate attention is given, but an oversight with our water bottle and an unanswered query marked minor lapses. 

The kitchen impressed with swift dish arrivals. Highlighting the menu, the Baked Eggs, reminiscent of shakshuka, stole the show, while the Fra Diavolo Mussels held their ground as a satisfactory choice. Huevos rancheros were passable but lacked a wow factor. Disappointment crept in with the Lobster BLAT and the SHELLY BENEDICTOWITZ; both fell short of expectations. 

However, the Everything Donuts, a twist on classic flavors with scallion cream cheese filling, were exceptional — airy, warm, and perfectly counterbalanced by the cool, tangy cream cheese.

2269,"Title: A Whirl at the Popular Pepperoni Square Haven

Review:

Visited a buzzing spot that's drawn in celebrities—a fact the establishment wears proudly on its walls. The place thrives in popularity, though patience is a virtue you'll need to embrace, as the line tends to move at a glacial pace.

I tried the much-talked-about pepperoni squares, which were decent but not celestial. A tad on the oily side, they did, however, come with a flavorful sauce and a liberal sprinkling of pepperoni. They were enjoyable, but not the pinnacle of pizza perfection.

Overall, the experience didn't sour my taste buds, and I'm not one to join the ranks of harsh critics without due cause. I'm dishing out a solid 4 stars, but a word to the wise for the establishment: a faster line would surely elevate the dining experience to match the city's pace. 

In a city like New York, where pizza joints are a dime a dozen and time is the currency of the streets, efficiency is key. Here's to hoping it gets better so the line can match the hype!",1
18677,"Was walking around the neighborhood and noticed the red flags and Japanese characters, so I immediately crossed the street to investigate.  Once I saw it was a ramen spot, my first thought was how I didn't know about it, and the answer to that was not inspiring.  My favorite ramen place is only a few more blocks away but I was feeling adventurous and the yelp rating looked promising.  It's a small and clean shop, with plenty of space between seats.  One kind and efficient server for fewer than 20 seats, and maybe 3 people in the kitchen.  Went with the shoyu ramen with added pork shoulder.  They used thin noodles here, which might be better paired with the tonkotsu. My soup arrived warm, presumably because the sliced pork shoulder and bean sprouts were cold when they were added to the broth.  Flavor wasn't overpowering but ultimately it was forgettable. In the end, I tried this place because it's in my neighborhood.  Unfortunately, with so many ramen spots in the city now it's hard for places to really stand out.  If you're in the area, it might be worth a visit just for the sake of completeness but it's hard to recommend anyone really going out of their way, especially with bigger names nearby. Personally I might give them another shot, so I can sample the tonkotsu.",0

I could taste all these flavors separately but they didn't go well together, I emphasize that. I would not come here again. Overhyped and dissatisfying.",0
1989,Unfortunately I had a poor take-out experience from here this week. I have been satisfied in the past so I was disappointed. I ordered the basil chicken. The taste and spiciness of it was to my liking but the only vegetable in the dish was onion. Which is drastically different than the advertised picture on Seamless and on their yelp pages. There were no red or green bell peppers in my order. And only two basil leafs. There are many Thai places in the neighborhood so hopefully they up their game to get on par soon.,0

The memory of the pizza I had there still lingers; it was a delightful example of Sicilian style, with the perfect balance of a slightly crispy bread base, a hint of spice in the sauce, wonderfully gooey cheese, and pepperoni that was both juicy and crisped to perfection.

Admittedly, I've been underwhelmed by other pizza offerings in the area, but this was a savory exception.

20049,"Title: A True Taste of Japan at Totto Ramen

I recently ventured into Totto Ramen, lured by its rave features on TV and YouTube, anticipating a bite of authenticity. The experience did not disappoint—starting with its cash-only policy, a nod to traditional establishments, and a conveniently placed ATM to accommodate.

The customer service was impeccably Japanese, with a necessity to summon the polite and attentive waitstaff using the proper honorifics, which added to the genuine ambiance. The interior mirrored a classic ramen shop in Japan, simple yet inviting, contributing to the overall immersive experience.

The star of the show, however, was the Mega Paitan. Although the broth's complex flavors initially puzzled my palate, missing that depth I'd anticipated, the tender, juicy meat and generous toppings rounded out the dish delightfully.

While the broth may have strayed from my expectations of a deeply flavored profile, it's clear that considerable effort goes into its creation—a culinary craft I appreciate. Totto Ramen is a must-visit for anyone seeking a slice of Japan without boarding a plane.",1
16956,"I recently visited Rustic Table for lunch and had a delightful dining experience. The iced chai tea latte I started with was outstanding - just the right balance of spices and refreshment. For the main meal, the Early lunch option did not disappoint, providing a satisfying and appetizing dish. I also sampled the Greek salad, which was a delicious mix of fresh ingredients, bursting with Mediterranean flavors. The complimentary bread served was a welcome addition, delightfully fresh and perfect for nibbling on while waiting for the main course. Seating at Rustic Table is on a first-come, first-serve basis, which added a relaxed, no-fuss atmosphere to the meal. Already looking forward to my next visit, I have my sights set on trying the shakshuka or avocado smash, which I've heard are must-tries. Highly recommend Rustic Table for anyone looking for a tasty, well-prepared lunch in a cozy setting.",1
14968,"My evening at this culinary haven was nothing short of spectacular – a solid 4.8-star experience. Set aside a leisurely 2-3 hours (or more if it's a bustling weekend night) to fully savor the epicurean journey here, as I did on a serene Sunday evening. Opting for a six-course meal, I was delighted by the additional appetizers and palate-cleansing intermezzos that graced the table.

The staff's service was impeccable, with meticulous explanations of each dish's ingredients and their origins. Wine aficionados will revel in the extensive selection that promises a perfect pairing for every course. Each dish was a masterpiece of unique flavors and inventive preparation, my personal highlight being the interactive 'make your own taco', showcasing scallops, pig ear, and a mélange of other fresh ingredients.

While every bite was a treat, I'd gently suggest a lighter hand with pear – its recurring presence felt somewhat repetitive across the dishes. Nevertheless, from the radish and turnip starter to the sumptuous desserts like the fruit cake finale, every course was a testament to the chef's prowess.

This dining establishment is a shrine to special occasions – a place to indulge in if time and finances permit. Returning would be a delight, reserved for those rare moments when one seeks to celebrate the art of gastronomy in all its glory.",1

11821,"Title: A Cozy Lunch with a Taste of Korea

My friends and I decided to stop by for a Saturday afternoon lunch, enticed by the promise of excellent seollungtang. To our delight, the restaurant wasn't crowded, allowing us to be seated immediately. A unique touch was the preparation of kimchi right before our eyes, with its juice charmingly served in a teapot. The kimchi itself struck a pleasant balance between spicy and sweet.

We started with beef japchae as an appetizer – a delightful beginning to our meal. Our main courses included Sogogi Gukbap, Gochujang BBQ, Seollungtang, and Kalbi Tang, each dish meeting our cravings with satisfying flavors and no cause for complaint. I'd seen previous reviews mention issues with hair in food, but happily, our experience was free from any such unpleasantness.

What's also appealing is the restaurant's 24/7 operation, which has me considering a post-night-out visit. Overall, a great dining experience with the comforting allure of Korean flavors.",1
18947,"Title: A Hidden Gem in the East Village

After an exhausting day of apartment hunting in NYC, I found solace at a little-known sushi spot in the East Village. Despite the short notice, they graciously squeezed me in for a solo meal on a quiet Monday evening.

Eager to indulge in their Omakase experience, I started with a cloudy sake and umeshi (plum wine), with the latter offering a sweet complement to the forthcoming sushi—just a heads-up for those less inclined towards sweet pairings. Later, a glass of Chardonnay proved to be a pleasant transition.

The Omakase here stood out from other experiences at establishments like Sushi by Bou & Domo Domo. The ambiance retained that quintessential East Village casualness, making the exquisite sushi all the more enjoyable. Highlights included the delicate scallop, rich mackerel, succulent snow crab, and flavorful sea eel.

The chef's friendliness added warmth to an already delightful meal. Though nearly missed due to its unassuming storefront—which made for a humorous ""blonde moment""—this restaurant is truly a delightful find. Highly recommended for Omakase enthusiasts, I'm already looking forward to my next visit.",1
19941,"Upon my recent jaunt to New York, right off the plane from LGA, my foodie crusade led me straight to the heart of Chelsea Market, where the Internet-famous Los Tacos had been tempting me from afar. Snuggled next to an aromatic tea and herbal store, this culinary gem is simple in its offerings—tacos, quesadillas, and a smattering of sides.

Despite being a Saturday afternoon, the sight of a snaking queue unfazed the seasoned New Yorkers. As a Chicagoan, the line seemed daunting, but the hype, coupled with my sister's encouragement, compelled us to stay. The speedy service was a revelation: what appeared to be an eternal wait transformed into a mere 10-minute slide towards the register.

The Carne Asada Tacos were a symphony of flavor, each bite infused with the tenderness of perfectly cooked meat. The Pollo Asada Quesadillas, accompanied by zesty, freshly mashed guacamole, made for an indulgent contrast, oozing with cheesy goodness. The rave reviews and social media buzz were no fluke—Los Tacos delivered an exceptional experience that lingered long after the last morsel was savored. A must-visit for anyone seeking an authentic, mouthwatering bite in the Big Apple.",1
19979,"Birthdays and break up anthems!! That's Toloache on a Saturday night. Whilst listening to a bunch of teen girls sing ""You Oughta Know"" at the top of their lungs, my table dined on platos of Carne Asado (that potato gratin was a meal in of itself) and Paella de Quinoa (all the ""meatiest"" veggies in the cutest bowl.) After two La Flaca margaritas, I was ready for my birthday song complete with churros and a single candle. Too bad it was drowned out by the Alanis Morisette concert down below us. If you can't sing over them, join them!",0
16265,"I come to this place so frequently I'm surprised that I didn't already write a review about it.This spot opened around 2015 and I discovered it after moving back to NYC and working around midtown - it has been a source of very good, fresh sushi/sashimi at reasonable prices. My Japanese colleagues all liked the spot (it's our new team lunch spot).When I go with my friends or family, we order the sushi/sashimi for two (or three) - it's a great selection of sushi and sashimi, all displayed on a pretty bridge/boat. Alone, I enjoy the lunch sushi/sashimi combo with spicy tuna. Love the kick of the spicy tuna here - not just a small flavor, but packs a nice punch. Additionally, it's not your run of the mill tuna mush, but rather chunks of tuna, which brings a better texture in each bite.Next time I should try some other dishes - the chirashi looks great - big assortment of sashimi over rice.",0
3608,"Title: NYC Thai Delight – A Family Lunch to Remember

My family, including visitors from Alaska, opted for an early Sunday lunch at this Thai gem in NYC. From the moment we arrived, the experience was seamless, greeted with immediate seating in a cozy booth tailored for our party of six.

Beverage orders were taken promptly; a soothing mix of hot tea, Thai iced coffee, and water graced our table. While perusing a menu brimming with options, we nibbled on a complimentary bowl of chips – a nice touch to start off the meal.

I played it safe with the Chicken Pad Thai, which was flavorful and well-executed. However, I couldn't help but feel a twinge of envy at the more adventurous dishes chosen by my companions – their plates were nothing short of a visual feast. Though my memory fails me on the specifics of what they ordered, their satisfied expressions and empty plates spoke volumes. My camera roll is now a vibrant testimony to the deliciousness that graced our table.

The ambiance of the restaurant added to the allure, with a charming entrance fountain, ethereal gold lanterns, and lavish gold leaf decorations. The service was impeccable, attentive without being intrusive, enhancing our overall dining experience.

For anyone looking for exceptional Thai cuisine in a stunning setting, this place should not be missed. A return visit is certainly in order for me – this time, with a bolder palate!",1
3270,"Think Dig Inn meets Asian food- clean, gourmet style bowls and bites with plenty of vegan optionsI couldn't resist checking out the Turnstyle Underground Market while getting off the train at Columbus circle. There are so many independent food stalls and little shops- it's definitely a fun place to stop.Hey Hey Canteen seemed like a healthy, flavorful dinner choice. The location is brand new. Seating is limited, definitely tough for a group but doable for a couple. We took our food to go and ate at home. They have several pre-set bowls and salads or you can make your own bowl. One of the most appealing things to me about the diy bowl was the option of sesame peanut noodles as the base.

To be fair, we also are at home about an hour after. If the dishes were about $1.50 less or if the dishes really kicked up the flavor and elegance, this would be a compelling option.",0
13799,"The fried chicken here is delicious!! We ordered the original drumsticks and then on the wings we got half and half soy garlic and spicy and they were all solid. I love that every piece was thiccc, meaning they really don't skimp out on giving you tiny little pieces. They're super fresh and the skin was crispy which I love. The regular fried chicken was solid and they give you ranch to dip it in. For the wings, I really enjoyed the soy garlic. The spicy was actually pretty darn spicy so be prepared for that. Each dish also had fried rice cakes scattered throughout which was a nice touch. The seafood pancake was solid choice, although if you wanted extra sauce, it would cost ya an extra nickel (I'm not even kidding). There's a crazy amount of people who order delivery here, the restaurant was cranking out food to the delivery guys nonstop, but if you want it fresh, do yourself a favor and stop by!",0
2917,"Title: A Scampi Worth the Flight!

If you find yourself at this charming eatery, the Mafaldini Scampi is a must-order. My anticipation for this dish was high after the Instagram buzz, and it lived up to the hype—absolute perfection on a plate!

Upon arrival, with luggage in tow from the airport, the staff's hospitality shone through, providing a storage solution without hesitation. The interior is stunning, with its lofty ceilings and modern lighting creating a romantic atmosphere—deceptively spacious from what you'd guess outside.

My friends had already started on an appetizer and drinks, which were both a treat for the taste buds and pleasing to the eyes. The drinks packed a punch, and the appetizer set the stage for what was to come.

Be warned, there might be a wait for the main courses, but patience pays off here. The scampi was divine, with noodles cooked to perfection and seasoning that sang with flavor. The portion does lean on the modest side for the $25 price tag, but the taste was so tantalizing I mulled over ordering a second helping.

In short, if you're after a dish that could justify jet-setting just for a taste, this restaurant's Mafaldini Scampi should be at the top of your list.",1
10995,"Title: A Harmonious Brunch at Blue Note

After a gap of two decades, I recently revisited Blue Note with my family to catch the Will and Pete Anderson quartet during brunch. The reservation process was a breeze, and even without assigned seating, we found ourselves comfortably nestled in the well-maintained venue by 10:30 AM for an 11:30 show.

Priced at $39.50 plus tax and gratuity, the brunch included an entree and a drink - a fair offer for a live show combo. The menu was brimming with brunch classics. I settled for an Angus burger with fries, my wife savored the corned beef hash, and my son enjoyed pancakes with eggs. We indulged in a flourless cake for an additional treat - a decision well made. While the food didn't transport us to culinary heavens, it was simply good and satisfying.

The staff deserves a shoutout for their warm hospitality, coupled with spotless facilities that made our experience even more pleasant.

The highlight, of course, was the Anderson quartet. The intimate ambiance of Blue Note accentuated the brothers' jazz saxophone mastery, humor, and heartfelt performances. Supported by talented bandmates on the guitar, bass, and drums, the show was an ensemble of individual spotlights woven into a seamless performance.

This family brunch resonated with authenticity, delightful tunes, and a genuine connection, making our return to Blue Note a memorable resurgence of jazz appreciation.",1
20100,"Title: Mixed Feelings at Prince Street

I visited Prince Street Pizza at 6 PM on a busy Wednesday evening and, as expected, faced a brief 10-minute wait. A word to the wise – bring cash to avoid an extra charge on credit card payments. Eager to try their fare, I opted for the much-talked-about spicy pepperoni square. Unfortunately, the pizza failed to live up to the hype. The crust was overly bready and struggled to support the toppings, which slid off with ease, leaving much to be desired in the cheese department. The saving grace, however, was the crispy, buttery edges of the pepperoni.

A word on logistics – unless you're ordering at least two slices, don't expect a box. Single slices are relegated to a paper bag which, in my case, resulted in a greasy mess as the toppings continued their escape during my journey home. Future visits could be improved with the option of single-slice boxes for easier, cleaner transport.",1
3459,"Title: A Trendy Take on Thai Cuisine with Mixed Results

During a recent lunch outing prompted by its high ratings, my friends and I ventured into a bustling spot that upends the traditional Thai eatery aesthetic, embracing a vibrant South American vibe with communal table layouts that immediately piqued our interest.

As a connoisseur of Thai dishes passed down from my mother, I eagerly anticipated the Tom Yum Soup but was met with a version that, although pleasant, didn’t quite match the complexity I've come to expect. The Penang Curry Beef, on the other hand, stood out with robust flavors that I’d heartily recommend.

Sampling my friends' choices, I’d steer clear of the lackluster sour curry fish and instead opt for the savory pad prik king pork. While the culinary experience had its high points, it fell short of its esteemed 4.5-star rating, with inconsistencies that diminished the overall impression.

For those seeking a more traditional and uniform Thai experience that also provides greater value, I’d point them towards Khao Kang in Queens, a venue that remains true to the Thai culinary heritage with both authenticity and consistency.",1
10628,"I recently indulged in the spicy miso vegetarian ramen at a bustling local hotspot, customizing it with egg, scallions, corn, and a dollop of garlic paste – and let me tell you, it was an absolute taste explosion. For those with a milder palate, consider requesting the spice on the side, as it packs a punch. The bowl arrived brimming with fresh, colorful veggies, each spoonful a delight. Fortune was on our side as we avoided the typical wait – there's usually a line out the door, so be prepared to jot your name down. Take note: it's a cash-only establishment, but believe me, it's well worth a trip to the ATM.",1
16485,"I came here for lunch with a friend since I work nearby.  They're still in their soft opening phase so the food was 25% off.  There was Yaso Tangbao Noodle Bar (dry noodles or rice bowls), Curry 42 (curry bowls), Rice-On (poke bowls and sushi), Debutea (bubble tea), and Bee Patterns (ice cream and bubble waffle desserts).  I got the pork ribs over dry noodles and my friend got the spicy minced chicken over rice.  The portions were a good size and came with sauteed cabbage.  The ribs were tender.  The minced chicken was spicy and flavorful.  However, the rice tasted old probably because there's low turnover here.  The noodles were tasty at least.  The upstairs seating area was nice.  It was pretty empty when we came.  I doubt I would come back unless they improve the food and bring back the soup dumplings at Yaso Tangbao.",0
2338,"Title: A Swift Pre-Theater Sip at The Smith

I recently stopped by The Smith at Lincoln Center for a pre-ballet drink on a bustling early Saturday afternoon in December. The venue was alive with the weekend brunch crowd, but I found respite at the bar with my glass of Montepulciano (Contesa, D'Abruzzo, Italy 2017) for $15, a personal favorite. Despite the busy atmosphere, my experience was peaceful, my drink savored undisturbed.

I didn't explore their culinary offerings, so no food critique here. However, the restrooms were notably clean, and the staff was commendably attentive and warm. As for location, it's conveniently close to the Lincoln Center and a stone's throw from the 1 local train.

The Smith proved to be a fitting spot for a quiet interlude before the ballet's enchantment.",1

13792,"Title: A Diner with Eastern European Flair

Body:
Venturing into this establishment pre-midnight for the first time, I was delighted to find that the food holds up spectacularly in the sober light of dinner hour. The place has a diner's charm, yet delivers a culinary experience akin to a traditional Eastern European eatery, without the tablecloths but with all the taste.

Starting with the borscht, it was, without exaggeration, some of the best I’ve ever savored. The beets were perfectly tender, the beef bits succulent, and the broth a rich tapestry of slow-cooked goodness, lifted by fresh dill and a swirl of sour cream. The only letdown was the slightly stale accompanying bread.

The beef stroganoff was a nourishing delight, featuring stewed beef cubes that melted in the mouth, married with a generous helping of mushrooms and served over comforting egg noodles—a dish reminiscent of home cooking.

The deluxe meat plate offered a mixed bag. The potato pierogis were a highlight, particularly with the side of sour cream and sautéed onions. While the meat fillings were satisfactory, the sauerkraut-filled pierogi didn't hit the mark for me. The grilled kielbasa was tasty but left me wanting more, whereas the stuffed cabbage was notably outstanding, with well-cooked leaves enveloping a delicate, meatloaf-like filling.

Opting for the potato pancake as a side was a wise decision, proving superior to average latkes with its ideal crispy-to-soft ratio. It was simply divine with a dollop of sour cream and apple sauce.

To quench my thirst, the watermelon iced tea was a refreshing choice—though I would have enjoyed a more pronounced watermelon presence over the dominant tea flavor.

All in all, this diner is a delightful surprise for anyone craving authentic Eastern European cuisine in an unassuming setting.",1
20033,"Highly rated by the Yelp Nation so you know I had to try. 4.5 stars wow! Unfortunately, I am not on the same page with the everyone on this place. It has a cool quick service flow to it and a unique take on different bowls. Pretty much the only thing you can order are different bowl combos with a base (rice, greens, or both) proteins and toppings. I went with the california bowl which had tofu, avocado, bean sprouts, and some other stuff. It was good but not 4.5 star good. The flavors werent bad but I didnt think there was much rhyme or reason behind the combo of ingredients. The person I was with went with the penang bowl. It was very spicy and even though they warn you on the menu be on the lookout. She said it was good but nothing special. The one appetizer type dish you can order are the spring rolls and they were pretty good. They come freshly fried with a good crunch and flavorful filling. Not a must order but were good. Overall, I have this place at 3 stars. If I am in the area and starving I would maybe come back. It probably isn't my first choice but it delivers a decent product.",0

11310,"Title: Unmet Potential at Village's Melons Offshoot

My recent visits to the new Village location of the renowned Melons have proven that even a stellar menu cannot compensate for underwhelming service.

On two separate occasions, I encountered what I can only describe as service reminiscent of a lackluster Applebee's. Most recently, a work lunch was disturbed by a rather overzealous bartender, who, moonlighting as our server, appeared more interested in inflating our bill than meeting our needs. His persistent upselling, followed by a rush to clear our table when we declined additional offerings, was the antithesis of the relaxing dining experience we had sought.

In an almost empty restaurant, the host's decision to guide us to a cramped two-top was perplexing and unnecessary. I found myself longing for a simple, straightforward meal without the sales pitch and spatial discomfort.

Though it pains me to say, for those seeking a hassle-free lunch in the area, I recommend skipping the Village's Melons and heading to Deninos instead, which is but a short stroll down the street.",1

1535,"Title: Elevated Dining with a View at Catch

Catch undoubtedly earns a solid 5/5 for ambiance, especially if you secure a spot on the roof. With stunning city views, lush greenery, and a calm that escapes the bustle below, it's an urban oasis. The service matches the setting in excellence, a unanimous 5/5. From the warm greetings at the door to the attentive farewell, the staff, particularly our waiter (possibly named Sam?), impresses with their menu knowledge and perfect balance of attentiveness.

The food scores a respectable 4/5. The crispy shrimp is a crowd-pleaser, and despite its name, the spicy mayo is approachable for all palates. The pan-seared snapper, while not extraordinary, was redeemed by its perfectly crisped skin. However, the star of the show was the lobster mash—indulgently creamy and a dish I'm eager to revisit.

In short, Catch is a must-visit for a friendly, relaxed dining experience with some standout dishes and a memorable rooftop ambiance. Looking forward to my next visit—thank you, Catch!",1
17063,"Title: Cozy Brunch Spot in the Theatre District - L'Adresse

We stumbled upon L'Adresse while seeking a brunch venue near the theatre district. With a reservation in hand, we were promptly seated in a delightful booth. The menu offered enticing choices and did not disappoint. My Eggs Benedict, perched atop a cloud-like pain de mie, was exquisite, with perfectly cooked eggs. Meanwhile, the French toast and avocado toast were both hits at our table. 

There was a slight hiccup; the server misheard my husband's order, bringing out a Chilean seabass instead of the L'Adresse skillet he had requested. Despite this mix-up, the issue was swiftly corrected with the desired skillet arriving hot and satisfying, though it defeated his appetite before he could finish.

The ambiance at L'Adresse was both cozy and relaxing, an ideal setting for a pre-show brunch. The service remained attentive throughout our visit. Just a tip for weekend visitors – secure a reservation to avoid the brunch rush.",1
10222,"Title: A Taste of Peru in the West Village

Last evenings at Panca, a Peruvian gem in the West Village, are a late summer delight. Opting for their inviting al fresco dining, we were immediately immersed in a culinary journey.

The ceviche mixto was our opening act, a vibrant medley of raw shrimp, clams, halibut, and octopus bathed in a piquant rocoto leche de tigre. Paired with a chilled Chardonnay, it set the tone for an evening of flavor.

We shared the Jalea de camaron y calamar, a satisfying crunch of perfectly fried shrimp and calamari, boosted by the tang of salsa criolla and a spicy kick of rocoto mayonnaise. The star of the night was the half-order of rotisserie chicken, a Peruvian staple that had us savoring every bite, alongside hearty tacu-tacu rice and beans.

Our experience was enhanced by attentive service, a prime location, and the iconic World Trade Center as a backdrop. Panca delivered a memorable dining experience that's a must for aficionados of Peruvian cuisine.",1
242,"I love coming to tacombi for their food! Every location I have been to so far has had great service along with delicious food!For valentines day, the hubby and I went to the Empire state building and I decided to bring him to tocombi since Empire state building offered the prefixed dinner voucher. $15.51 plus applicable sales tax and tip for a grand total of $19.99. We got 2 vouchers. Each one included 1 appetizer, a choice of 4 served family style tacos per person and unlimited homemade refreshing Mexican fruit drinks. When we got there, we were told that the menu had changed but wasn't updated on the Empire state building website and it was 2 tacos per person which was a let down. So we got Guac and Corn Esquites as our apps. Both were good but the corn was out of this world! Sooo soo good and worth trying! The Guac was a smooth blend of Haas avocados, jalapeno, red onions and lime juice thatch made fresh through out the day for the best fresh taste & it's served with homemade Vista Hermosa tortilla chips A for the tacos we got the Beef babacua tacos!

The cashew queso had a ton of flavor. I definitely recommend coming for the happy hour which is 3-7 on weekdays! They even have food specials. I also liked that you pay for your food and drinks upfront at the register so you don't have to wait for the waiter to bring the check at the end.The interior is also really cute and they play awesome music.

13302,"Title: Cozy Stop with Room for More - 3.5/5

On a chilly, rain-spattered day, my companion and I sought refuge in this well-talked-about eatery, lured by the promise of comfort food. The bustling atmosphere didn't deter the attentive service, and the beer selection was impressive, a highlight for any hops aficionado.

Eager to warm up, I opted for the vegan shoyu ramen, adorned with an extra egg, while we shared curry cauliflower and spicy kyuri pickles. Vegetarian options can be hit or miss for me, given my dietary restrictions and a recent attempt to balance a hearty drink itinerary.

The ramen was satisfactory, though it lacked the piping hot broth I craved and was modest in portion, particularly given the price. The noodles were adequate but missed that quintessential springiness. The curry cauliflower didn't quite hit the mark with its seasoning, leaving me longing for a bolder spice profile.

However, the spicy kyuri pickles were a triumph, a definite must-retry. They'll be on my list for the next visit, alongside that elusive chicken paitan I was initially recommended but forgot to order. 

I'll be back to give it another whirl, with hopes to sample more dishes, and unquestionably, another round of their notable beer.",1
2359,"I recently visited a popular pizzeria with high hopes, only to be met with disappointment. The wait was over 30 minutes, a test of patience under the sweltering sun followed by a cramped and stifling indoor space devoid of air conditioning. The promise of their famed spicy square pepperoni and a classic margherita slice fell flat; the pepperoni was drowned in oil, creating unappetizing pools atop a thick, greasy dough. While it was not entirely without merit, it certainly wasn't exceptional. The margherita fared no better, striking me as quite ordinary and failing to ignite a desire for more than a few bites.

The waiting area's atmosphere added to the discomfort, crammed with customers in various stages of their dining experience, all equally overheated and impatient. The shop seemed amply profitable to afford basic amenities like air conditioning for their patrons, which was notably present at the cashier's station but nowhere else.

Although I'm no stranger to long lines for quality food – I've enjoyed the offerings at Joe's in Times Square – this experience was unrewarding. The quality of the pizza did not justify the wait or the uncomfortable conditions. Even without the deterrent of a queue, I find it unlikely that I would return for the food alone. Prince Street Pizza did not live up to the hype and, unfortunately, misses the mark for me.",1
2230,"My friend and I decided to stop by here on New Years day around 5 pm. We have been eye-ing this place for a while after seeing it on Instagram. When we came in, we were greeted right away and quickly seated by the waiter. The menu is extremely extensive with a lot of food and drink options. They have both dessert as well as salty food options. We decided to go with the matcha egg dessert which was absolutely delicious. I highly recommend that dessert, it comes with ice cream and cream. The presentation is amazing and perfect for Instagram. We also decided to get two drinks Lavendar Peach Ade and Brown Sugar Coffee. The brown sugar coffee was just alright, nothing special and quite expensive for something that was similar to just a regular cup of coffee. I do not recommend the Lavendar Peach-Ade AT ALL, it had a weird strange taste to it and reminded me a bit of drinking soap (but honestly, it could be personal preference because I saw other customers drinking theirs.)Overall, I would return for the desserts but I would def pass on their drinks.",0

14905,"I was in the area and was excited to try Ippudo - made my way over around 5p and there were actually people sitting there eating already! They sat me in a communal table and gave me a menu. I opted to go for:Akamaru Shinaji ($16)- pork tonkotsu broth, thin noodles, pork belly chashu, sesame kikurage mushrooms, scallions, cabbage, garlic oil, secret Umami Dama paste.Opted for an egg as well, because why not!The ramen actually came out quicker than I thought, coming within 10 minutes. I was excited to dig deep! The ramen itself was good as it was really firm in itself but the broth itself was eh. It didn't really bring a rich pork flavor that I had grown accustomed to, and for a place that had so many reviews, it was a let down. I enjoyed eating the mushrooms and scallions and the chashu was a bit thicker than accustomed and yes it was flavorful hehe. The egg was not good LOL. Hard skip.Service was more reactive than proactive, as they were surrounding and looking around, but didn't really come over til you asked for them, which is alright since it was a communal area, but it was interesting to see it in action haha.",0
3485,"Couldn't get the pizza cause there weren't slices available.   Had the brick oven baked lasagna which was super over salted.  It's unfortunate since all the elements such as meat, cheese, pasta, marinara and basil were all perfect.  Good portion size and well priced.  Another debacle was that it was slightly cold in the center when I cut into it.",0
1823,"The pizza is actually pretty decent. I'm a sucker for deep dish so I got the sicilian with pepperoni. It's just thicker bread which makes it more filling, not necessarily better. The dough isn't especially tasty. Thin pizza has never intrigued me, but I imagine it would be good here. Plenty of cheese and crispy pepperoni. The pizza is pricey. I'm sure it's more of an artisan type of place, but I just want a good deep dish in the neighborhood",0

12011,"Title: A Convenient Bite in Times Square

On a cold, snowy Monday at 1:45 pm, I found myself seeking refuge and a quick bite in the bustling Times Square area. This spot was a welcome oasis. I was in desperate need of some warmth and sustenance. To my delight, a piping hot slice of supreme pizza was served in front of me within minutes of walking in. The crispy thin crust delivered a satisfying crunch from the first bite to the last, complemented by a generous heap of tangy toppings.

While it may not be the pinnacle of New York pizza, it certainly stands clear of the bottom rung. For those caught in the Times Square area with a craving for a straightforward slice, this place is worth a shot. At $7.50 for a slice paired with a soda, and the convenience of about a dozen tables to sit at, it's a fair deal for a speedy and tasty snack.",1
12375,"Title: A Slice of Supreme Satisfaction at NY Pizza Suprema

During a weeklong pizza-tasting mission in NYC, my boyfriend and I made an impromptu stop at NY Pizza Suprema, fresh off the adrenaline of ""Sleep No More."" My research on the highest-rated pizzerias nearby led us to this bustling establishment with a queue that reassured our choice.

The exterior of NY Pizza Suprema belied the deliciousness inside, a recurring theme in our New York experiences. Inside, the challenge was to choose from an enticing array of pizzas under the benevolent gaze of the late Anthony Bourdain. The ""Upside Down,"" ""Burrata,"" and ""Fra Diavolo"" slices eventually triumphed as our selections.

Seating was swift, and soon we were indulging in what could only be described as a blissful pizza feast. The slices, although pricier than anticipated, justified every cent with their mouthwatering flavors.

NY Pizza Suprema might lack in grandeur, but it's a must-visit for the pizza connoisseur. A delightfully unexpected highlight in our pizza-laden adventure.",1
18281,"Tucked away in a unique underground location, this gem of a brunch spot offers an ambiance that instantly wins you over upon entry. My reservation was honored immediately, and the swift seating allowed for an early start to the highlight of the visit: the unlimited mimosas. Surprisingly potent, the mimosas set a festive tone for the meal.

Opting for a veggie omelet, I was impressed by the dish's robust flavor, accompanied by a satisfying side of greens and potatoes. The service lived up to the food's standard, being both friendly and efficient.

While the restaurant enforces a 90-minute seating policy to prepare for the next wave of patrons, the transition to the bar area for lingering over drinks felt seamless and unobtrusive. The allotted time felt ample for a leisurely brunch.

My experience was nothing short of delightful, ensuring that I will be making another visit soon.",1
2644,"I recently visited Havana Central, initially skeptical of its Times Square location which often caters to the tourist crowd. To my delight, the restaurant exceeded expectations and provided a fantastic pre-theater dining experience. My boyfriend and I indulged in a shared house salad and enjoyed a complimentary chicken empanada, a perk of checking in on Yelp. The ropa vieja was the highlight of our meal, boasting rich flavors and authentic Cuban flair. Although the plantain basket appetizer didn't quite hit the mark for me, the meal redeemed itself with a decadent tres leches cake to finish. Overall, Havana Central is a gem that shines bright even in the touristy hustle of Times Square. I'm tipping my hat with a well-deserved 4.5 star rating.",1
13136,"I recently dined at a quintessential New York Steak House that captured the essence of fine dining from the moment I stepped through the doors. The interior boasted beautiful decorations that set the stage for an exceptional culinary experience. The food was nothing short of top-notch, featuring perfectly cooked steaks and a menu that catered to all palates.

But it wasn't just the food that made the evening memorable; it was the impeccable service. Our waiter, Adam, was a standout—his knowledge of the menu was impressive, and his courteous manner added a touch of class to our dining experience. His recommendations were spot-on, and he ensured that our meal was enjoyable from start to finish. This steakhouse is a must-visit for anyone looking for the full New York dining experience.",1
1455,"Title: A Salty, Spicy, Skewer Soiree

I recently visited a place that redefined my skewer standards – and I must say, it was a deliciously salty affair. Though I opted for medium spice, the dishes packed a punch that was both fiery and flavorful. It's clear some items, like their BBQ Chinese skewers, rightfully embrace their salty nature, although a tad less sodium wouldn't hurt.

The veggie skewers, priced between $2-$6, didn't quite hit the mark, offering a scant 3-5 pieces per skewer. However, make no mistake, the complimentary appetizers are where the restaurant truly shines. The standout was the crawfish and crab cajun boil, complete with succulent sausages and corn that was the epitome of sweet and savory bliss. The crawfish might be on the tiny side, but if you're lucky enough to snag a crab shell, you're in for a treat.

The free appetizer selection also included cold chicken feet and oranges, though it seems the offerings might vary daily. Initially skeptical about the complimentary nature of such premium items, I was pleasantly surprised and would urge others to indulge without hesitation.

Our skewer journey was a symphony of tastes, with the bacon-wrapped youtiao stealing the show – a clever combination of crispy and soft textures. The short rib followed closely with its immaculate char and tenderness, and we enjoyed a host of other meaty delights like beef, lamb, and diverse sausages. The mussels broke the skewer mold, arriving with a dollop of mayo instead, but were equally enjoyable.

For the skewer enthusiasts who can go beyond 15 items, the all-you-can-eat option at $30 might be your best bet. We chose a la carte and ended up with a hearty 30-40 items for our party of three, leaving us thoroughly satisfied, though personally, I could have enjoyed even more.

The total bill came to $86 after taxes and an 18% tip, which felt like a fair price for the quality and quantity, especially considering the appetizers. If you're up for a culinary adventure that's high on taste (and salt), this is a spot you won't want to miss.",1
12137,"Consistently great for dinner! We have been going here for years and the food is always amazing. We always order similar dishes when we come here and so far I'm just going to list our favorite dishes here.For appetizers, we usually get the lettuce wrap which is served with ground chicken marinated and cooked in soy sauce. The roti canai is also a must have which is a thin pancake served with chicken curry. For the main dishes, we usually get some type of curry soup. This time we tried the seafood curry and it tasted like mild Tom yum soup and was delicious. We always get beef rendang which is grilled beef marinated in coconut milk and curry. I think it's the best dish at this restaurant.They also have a small collection of wines and beers. The staff is always nice and there is usually very little or no wait on weekdays to grab a table for 2.",0
17338,"Came here for breakfast around 9:45am on a Saturday. We were seated right away. Love their breakfast menu. It is so cheap and cheerful as you can see from the menu. We ordered the stir fry noodles and also the steamed rice rolls. It came with coffee, although one can choose another drink.  All this was $5.25 and was enough to share between two people. There are other items I have not tried on the menu but will try to work through them over the year.",0
16904,"Title: A Serendipitous Find

Last night's impromptu dinner at this buzzing establishment exceeded all expectations. Despite almost being deterred by the crowd, a welcoming gesture from the host ushered us into an ambiance that struck the perfect balance between chic modernity and comfort. The music complemented the scene, allowing for easy conversation.

The cuisine, an inventive take on Mexican tapas, allowed for an enjoyable mix-and-match experience. Highlights included a robust taco salad, refreshingly innovative avocado greens, a succulent shrimp taco, and flavourful chicken taquitos. Even as a discerning diner, I found the sauces delightful and not overpowering.

In conclusion, this little gem won me over with its charm and delectable fare. Highly recommended and certainly a spot I plan to revisit.",1
2775,"Nestled in a bustling locale, this charming cafe quickly became my morning go-to. Their coffee and pastry selection stands out – you can’t go wrong starting your day with their fresh, buttery croissants paired with a robust cup of coffee. While I sampled various breakfast offerings, including a hearty salmon bagel sandwich and a classic bagel with cream cheese, the latter fell a bit short with bagels not quite hitting the mark on freshness. However, the consistently friendly and prompt service made up for this minor shortcoming. If you're in the area, it’s the perfect stop for a quick, delightful breakfast on the go.",1
19643,"Came here for lunch, not a taco fan but wanted to give it a shot. Got the taco salad with chicken. It was okay... pulled chicken atop lettuce with white and red sauce. The place, atmosphere and packaging were awesome but the selection was not the best in that was limited, one could say they do a few things well but I will not be returning. I still suggest you try it out though, you may love it !",0
11340,"Oh man this restaurant is a dream come true!!! I went here twice in one week. I had to come back again ASAP for the 24 layer chocolate cake!! I could eat that everyday if I could.The first time I came my friend and I shared the Market Pasta and Shrimp Pillow Dumplings. YUM to both. Our server was Dan M. and he was wonderful!!The second time, I went with 3 other people and we ordered the Honey & Butter pull apart bread(YUMMM!!), Chicken and Eggplant Parmesan, Steak Frites (made to perfection), Buffalo Mac & Cheese, and Deluxe French Dip. EVERYTHING IS DELICIOUS. Literally everything. We were so full that we couldn't fit the chocolate cake right away so we ordered it to go. Our server was Nicholas K. And he was the sweetest ever!! Another server brought our boxed chocolate cake and I guess Nicholas thought we left without it so after we walked out Nicholas chased after us with the chocolate cake yelling ""GUYS! I HAVE YOUR CAKE!"" Hahaha so nice of him. We let him know we already had it though. Made our day. Will be back endless times to this restaurant!!! 10/10 would recommend.",0
11826,"So glad I finally had the chance to dine here. I was between 3 and 4 stars, but they killer views, adorable bar overlooking the water, and really cute ambiance that makes you feel like you're in the country, rather than in one of the biggest cities in the world had me bump it up to 4. They also hooked us up pretty well, & didn't charge us for the wine we brought ($35 cork fee) or the desert I got for my birthday. Yay! We had a 8pm reservation and they took us to a table right near the windows overlooking the water, which was beautiful. We got to watch the sunset while dining too...definitely one of the best views in NYC. We started off with a round of cocktails...mine wasn't really that great, tasted just like a tequila sunrise, but the pricing was reasonable ($14/cocktail). Then they bread guy came around and offered us bread. My boyfriend tried his and said it was stale and I tried mine and thought it was stale too. We then asked the waiter if he could send the bread guy back, and he gave us two pieces of cold bread that weren't much better than the first two pieces. C'mon man! The menu was okay, nothing got me overly excited. Anyway, we started off with the grilled octopus and the crab cake. The grilled octopus came in a nice vinaigrette dressing. I would give the dish 3/5. The crab cake was good, not too much breading in it, which we liked. I loved the sauce it came with, so much so that I asked for more. For dinner we split the scallops and the bass. The scallops I loved. Five huge scallops with a side of fresh corn. I don't even love corn, but this corn was fresh, sweet, and delicious. The striped bass was okay, a little dry and the squash and white heirloom eggplant was okay, nothing to rave about. Service was okay overall. No complaints, but nothing spectacular either. The place was pretty dead when we left around 9:30/9:45.The only bummer about this place is the fact that you have to walk in CP for 5-7 minutes to find it (not great in heels!) I will definitely come back to sit at the bar or sit outside and order a cocktail. It's very romantic & relaxing!",0
10637,"Title: A Satisfying Bite at a Humble Greenpoint Thai Spot

While on the hunt for a quick Thai fix in Greenpoint, my friend and I stumbled upon this unassuming eatery after our first choice rejected card payments. Our initial impression was overshadowed by the restaurant's diminutive size, prompting concerns of leaving with lingering food odors. With time constraints, we opted for takeout and retreated to the car during the 30-minute wait, which felt somewhat lengthy given our hunger levels.

We both indulged in the spicy basil rice — mine topped with shrimp, hers teeming with veggies. The meal proved to be a satisfying delight with the sweet chili sauce elevating the flavors to a delightful crescendo, albeit the abundance of peppers required a bit of picking around. The accompanying spring rolls, dipped in a surprisingly tasteful sweet sauce, were a hit.

At $35 total, the value was fair, though a more generous portion of rice would have been appreciated. Nevertheless, the experience reminded us that sometimes the most gratifying meals come from the smallest of places.",1
13922,"Came here with friends for happy hour! Ordered coconut and mango margaritas that were on happy hour special. If  you like your alcohol to be masked by something fruity, get the mango; the coconut tasted like pure tequila. No me gusta. We shared the carnitas, res and pollo tacos. My favorite was the carnitas, but honestly there wasn't a bad choice, all were good. Such a hefty amount of meat in a taco. Sadly wasn't a fan of the sauces, green or red.Unfortunately service was quite slow. Had to ask several times for more water and waited several minutes to talk to our waiter again. We went at 6PM on a Tuesday - there wasn't much of a crowd at that time so we didn't understand why it was so difficult to get served. Good food, forgettable drinks, okay service.",0
20767,"A friend suggested this place to us, and to my surprise I saw the sign on their wall saying it was in the Spiderman movie. Pretty cool.I've never had a New York pizza, so I went in with no expectations. I didn't know what to expect, but it is certainly underrated.This place is cash only, and the pizzas are 4 bucks a slice, so make sure you're prepared. I thought that a bit expensive, but hey, it's New York. I think that's the norm. My friend and I shared one slice of the pep. The crust is paper thin, but it is chewy at the same time. I can't explain it. A guest on Phil Rosenthal said on his show that ""pizza is great bread."" And with that, you are right, sir. On top of that bread, the cheese and sauce are important. The cheese was stringy and s nice even though it may not look like it.I can't explain it. You just gotta go.",0
18053,"La Pulperia UES offers a reliable dining experience with its traditional Mexican fare. The service is competent, and the quality of the food is satisfactory, though it doesn't quite rise above the ordinary. Their pork sandwich, however, is a standout item — featuring thinly sliced, fried pork complemented by a zesty mayonnaise, giving it a bit of a kick. Despite not being quintessentially Mexican, the sandwich presents a tasty choice. Additionally, the drinks menu provides satisfying options to accompany your meal. Overall, La Pulperia UES is a decent choice for those in search of good, classic Mexican cuisine.",1
17615,"Amazing place for a date night! It's a small space so it has an intimate feel, but I didn't feel crammed like sardines as you do in some nyc restaurants. This restaurant has a very calm, chic ambiance. Perfect to have a nice dinner out.For wine, we went with the white rioja, as we've never seen that option! Very very light and smooth. We got the scallop and squid appetizers, both really good! I could eat those all day. Also got the pork basque, which was very tender and moist. The side of lentils was also a great side to get since it was cold and refreshing.Everything we ate was delicious and the service was great. Great hidden gem with a unique fusion of French and Basque!",0
3221,"Title: A Sweet Escape at Sprinkles Cupcakes in Lower Manhattan

After a long day, I found myself at Sprinkles Cupcakes in the bustling Hudson East food court of Brookfield Place, a convenient stop after exiting the 2, 3 trains on Park Place. Eager for a sugar fix to ease the day's stress, I dove into their famed cupcakes.

Heeding my friend Marlene G.’s recommendation, I opted for the strawberry cupcake priced at $3.95. It didn’t disappoint - the cupcake’s moist interior and richly sweet icing lived up to the hype. However, those monitoring their sugar intake should be cautious; the icing is a sugar bomb.

The service process here is efficient, albeit impersonal - think assembly line with a transactional vibe. Don't expect bubbly banter with your buttercream; the staff is notably reserved.

In short, Sprinkles Cupcakes offers a delicious indulgence for those seeking a sugary treat, though it might be best enjoyed sparingly by those with health concerns.",1
20612,"Trattoria Bianca offers a delightful ambiance with its charming red booths and a convenient full bar, perfect for guests of the Wyndham hotel with room charge services. The pricing is reasonable by New York standards, and the menu caters to a variety of dietary needs with excellent gluten-free pasta and vegan options, alongside American dishes for those less keen on Italian cuisine. The food is commendable, with particularly flavorful pasta and impeccably fresh, perfectly cooked scallops.

However, the dining experience is somewhat marred by the service. Despite the restaurant being sparsely populated and well-staffed, the waitstaff seemed to forget requests and neglected to refill water, detracting from the otherwise pleasant visit. The potential for a fully satisfying meal is there, if only the service could match the quality of the food and setting.",1

11406,"Title: A Nugget of Gold in a Small Package

I stumbled upon this gem after recalling an ad I'd seen on Tasty. Tucked away in an unassuming spot, this restaurant may be small, but it completely exceeds expectations. The concise yet diverse menu is well-suited to the cozy setting, offering just enough choice without overwhelming diners.

The standout for me was the buffalo nuggets paired with a creamy ranch sauce—a must-try for any buffalo sauce aficionado. Equally tempting are the mozz nugs; imagine biting into heavenly gooey mozzarella cheese balls—a simple concept executed to perfection. The fries remain a classic, done right with a fresh, crispy skin-on approach.

The one twist: don't expect the usual soda fountain here, as they only serve water. A healthier option, though unexpected. Nonetheless, this spot is a treasure worth seeking out for a satisfying meal.",1
2577,"Title: Disappointing Experience at Rosa Mexicano

I recently visited Rosa Mexicano with a group of friends and came away with a less than satisfactory experience. The decor of the restaurant was pleasant, offering a spacious setup ideal for large parties. However, the menu, while varied, was on the expensive side, particularly for dinner.

Unfortunately, the food failed to justify the high prices, delivering only mediocre flavors that left me underwhelmed. But the real deal-breaker occurred when my belongings were stolen from inside the restaurant - an incident that marred the entire experience.

An oversight led to me leaving my gym bag on a chair, which I swiftly returned to retrieve. To my dismay, the bag had been rummaged through, items were missing, and it was clear theft had occurred on the premises. When I sought assistance from the staff, I found them unhelpful, and the management was dismissive and took no responsibility. The restaurant's security measures were lacking, with non-functional cameras, and the response to my situation was lackluster.

Despite an offer to compensate for my losses or provide a complimentary meal, the follow-up was poor, and no resolution was reached. Regrettably, this will be my last visit to Rosa Mexicano, and I cannot recommend it to anyone given the poor handling of customer security and property.",1

15451,"What a complete and utter disappointment, almost on every level.For Valentine's Day I chose AOC East to take Jayson. Our tradition for the last 15 years, for birthdays, anniversaries and Valentine's Day, is that I choose the restaurant to surprise Jayson. And, until last night, we never had a miss. The main reason I chose AOC is that Jayson loves coq au vin. It's not the easiest dish to find at restaurants, mainly because it takes time to cook. Many places will offer it as a special, once a week. But AOC, much like Amelie in the Village (which we love) serves it nightly. And the reviews for AOC's coq au vin were all raves. After our night, I'm guessing the raves were from relatives. The coq au vin was good. The problem is, just about everything else really fell WAY below the mark.First, when we arrived the restaurant was not overly busy (yet). We got seated right away at a little table crammed in towards the back. It took probably 15 minutes or so before anyone came over to our table. Yet, the table behind us, which arrived 10 minutes after us, were taken care of right away, with bread and beverages. I had to get up to ask someone finally to bring us bread (took another 10 minutes) and to come over to us. That also seemed to set the tone for the rest of the night. It's not like it's a huge restaurant. It's actually quite small, which was another reason I chose it. Maybe because we didn't order liquor (we don't drink) that we were to feel invisible and left to constantly wait or seek out the server.We started with oysters (for me, because I am obsessed with oysters), french onion soup and the flan foie gras (for Jayson). The oysters horrible. Yikes. I didn't mean that. I meant they were horrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrible! The oysters were extremely lackluster and not shucked very well. I kept getting bits of shell and crud with each one. And they were the very low end of the oyster chain (i.e., the cheap, blah kind that restaurants like to serve for their $1 happy hour, even though it wasn't happy hour.) The onion soup was rather disappointing and a bit rancid tasting. They prepared it with some kind of parsley seasoning that made it taste like the stove top stuffing you'd eat on Thanksgiving. Uck! I don't eat stuffing then, and I certainly don't want my onion soup tasting like it now.I also wish they hadn't served us the bread, as it turned out to be rather hard and stale.The mains are where they scored better on. Jayson's coq au vin was a hit. He found the choice to serve it with pasta to be an innovative twist.I had the filet mignon special, with potatoes au gratin and stringbeans served with a peppercorn sauce. It was good. Not exceptional. But good. The sauce was delicious, but that's not what I paid $36 for. Plus it was for the string beans. The potatoes au gratin were overcooked and tasted a bit like they were quickly put into a microwave before serving. I couldn't really make my way through them.Overall, this wasn't a great meal or a great Valentine's dinner by any means. It certainly wasn't worth $200 (with no alcohol). Maybe that was our mistake. Perhaps the key to finding this place enjoyable, and the food and service tolerable, is to get liquored up.Between the extremely disappointing appetizers, the terrible service and everything else, it ruined whatever delight we had from the mains. I should also add that when we got home, Jayson started feeling queasy and his stomach was upset. He thinks it had to do with the foie gras.The only saving grace is that after 15 years, we are able to find the silver lining, which is that it didn't ruin the day itself for us, because that's what love is about. And, I can tell you this, our feelings for this place were anything but love.",0
15590,"Title: A Stellar Evening at Scarpetta, Madison Avenue

Scarpetta has a reputation for trendsetting locations, and its Madison Avenue branch in NYC maintains that stylish vibe with flair. From my previous experiences at their Miami venue, I was excited to see if New York lived up to my high expectations—and it certainly did.

Upon entering, the warm reception set the tone for the night. The ambience speaks of sophistication, and the service is nothing short of incredible; attentive staff make you feel like royalty without being overbearing.

Italian cuisine is their forte, but with options like the mains we chose, Scarpetta can effortlessly cater to a palette seeking a touch of American flair. The wine selection, presented by the knowledgeable sommelier Ryan, was impressive—I delighted in a Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon throughout the meal.

Bread service came with a trio of rolls, coupled with a savory caponata, refreshing lemon olive oil, and an herbaceous butter, providing a simple yet delectable start. For appetizers, the Yellowtail and Arctic Char crudo shone, but it was the latter that captured my taste buds with its ocean-fresh, buttery texture.

I passed on pastas (though acclaimed) for a roast chicken main, while my companion had the branzino. Note that Scarpetta’s offerings are modest in size, focusing on quality and meticulous presentation over quantity. The chicken was perfectly cooked and arrived with a tasty ensemble of butternut squash and potatoes. A taste of the branzino confirmed its excellence.

Dessert was a whimsical affair; a slice of ricotta cheesecake, partnered with pomegranate sorbet, and a serendipitous chocolate anniversary greeting (courtesy of a mix-up). Although ricotta cheesecake isn’t my go-to dessert, it was certainly well-crafted.

In summary, Scarpetta, Madison Avenue, excels at curating an exquisite dining experience. From the impeccable food and presentation to the top-tier service and welcoming atmosphere, they hit every mark. Having been impressed in Miami, I'm pleased to report the New York experience aligns with Scarpetta's esteemed standard. Well done, indeed.",1

I went there this past Sunday around 11 pm with my bf. The location we went to was near Penn Station which was extremely convenient for us since we had to catch a train exactly an hour and ten minutes later. Anyways, we entered and were seated at a small table in between 2 other parties. The closeness between each table/party was a little too close for my comfort, but I dealt with it. I love the French/Parisian style concept, and if I wasn't able to see the crowded NYC streets right in front of me, for a second, you would feel like you're out of country.Anyways, the menu for brunch was extensive. I ordered the Avocado + Egg dish and my bf ordered Bacon + Egg. The avocado toasts came out on two small quinoa breads with feta cheese, and my eggs scrambled as I requested. The avocado toast was DELISH. My meal was satisfying and perfect. I would love to stop by another time to try one of their coffee drinks. Definitely recommend!",0

Fresh arugula salad, complimented with warm roasted pears, shaved Parmesan, toasted walnuts and white basaltic vinaigrette. I decided to add grill chicken - All salads include the option to add a protein, $8 Chicken, $9 Shrimp and $12 for salmon. This was delicious!! The warmed pears were so flavorful along with the roasted walnuts which added texture. The   vinaigrette.....wrapped it up oh so nicely. Can't wait to go back!",0

15732,"Upon disembarking from our DC bus journey, we made a beeline for this gem in search of authentic Italian fare. The pasta noodles here certainly did not disappoint, striking that sought-after al dente balance. The tortellini was a particular delight, enveloping the palate with its rich flavors. Equally impressive was the squid ink pasta, which offered a delectable medley of seafood, each bite bursting with oceanic zest. However, it fell slightly short of perfection as I had anticipated a creamier sauce to accentuate the unique squid ink essence. Nonetheless, the overall experience was a praiseworthy homage to Italian culinary tradition.",1
19062,"Having dined at ICHIRAN last Saturday night, the experience was indeed memorable. Despite the bustle of the 9:00 pm crowd and a 20-minute wait, the thoughtful process of ordering via a paper menu while waiting eased the process. On being seated, the presentation of this pre-filled menu to the staff streamlined our order. The convenience of a call bell for service added to the efficient dining experience.

As for the meal itself, the ramen was exceptional – the noodles, pleasingly thin, paired with a broth rich in flavor yet not overly salted, and the pork chashu tender and succulent. ICHIRAN delivered a flawless bowl that left us savoring each element. A must-visit for ramen enthusiasts.",1
17138,"Barbounia serves true Mediterranean fusion , integrating popular dishes from several cuisines. Overall 3.5 stars.The atmosphere is inviting and energetic. The staff is well-dressed and the space is ornately decorated. This is a great spot for groups to share several plates. To start, we orders several small plates including labne, spicy feta and babbaganoosh, which were all tasty. The real star of the apps was the Saganaki that was served flaming from the ignited brandy.We tried some larger plates including the hangar steak and chicken shish kebab. The steak was well cooked and aesthetically pleasing, while the chicken was a bit dry but served with faro and tahini to bring out some flavor. Overall, we enjoyed our dinner here. The food is good, but not exceptional. Given there is much competition for Mediterranean/middle eastern cuisine in the city, I can't say it was the best I've had, but definitely worth a visit.",0
17158,"Title: A Mixed Bag at Noodle Haven

My recent visit to a spacious local eatery off-peak hours allowed for a comfortable dining experience without the usual bustle. The menu was promising, featuring items like fried chicken drumsticks and an array of noodle dishes.

Unfortunately, the chicken drumsticks were underwhelming, lacking the punch of flavor one craves from such a classic dish. However, the restaurant redeemed itself with their mega paitan – a dish boasting a rich and savory broth that enveloped the taste buds with every spoonful, a must-try for flavor enthusiasts.

The totto tsukemen, a unique dipping noodle dish, was a bit of a puzzle. Served with cold noodles and ingredients, the concept encourages diners to dip into a hot soup. While novel, the soup failed to retain its heat, leading to a tepid experience. A pro tip: let the meat bask in the soup before indulging, ensuring a more harmonious temperature and taste.

On a positive note, the establishment proved practical with an abundance of napkins to tackle the inevitable noodle slurp fiasco – a thoughtful touch that did not go unnoticed.

In conclusion, while not all dishes hit the mark, those like the mega paitan show promise. A bit more attention to detail could easily elevate this restaurant from just another noodle spot to a gastronomic destination.",1
17888,"This was the worst hotpot experience I have ever had. They must've thought partnering with Pulsd would make business better and get a different crowd in for publicity but this has done the complete opposite for them based on all the recent reviews. I have paid very close attention to all the fine prints and made a reservation for 7 people (we had 3 Pulsd deals and it was someone's birthday so they were free). When I first saw the deal, it was a complete steal considering how much AYCE hotpot cost nowadays and we were able to stack a bunch of these deals together. I made a reservation for 6pm on a rainy Wednesday night thinking it wouldn't be crowded but boy was I wrong. We got there before 6pm and there was a line to checkin with the hostess. If they knew how busy it was, I don't understand why there wasn't more than one hostess or at least have a separate line for walkins and those who actually made reservations.Everyone ahead of us didn't make a reservation and the hostess had to explain to each person that the next available table was at 8pm and it took these people forever to decide if they wanted to wait or not. By the time we got to the hostess it was 6:22pm and she told us because we had reserved for 6pm we would have to leave by 8pm, which makes no sense whatsoever. If we wanted our full 2 hours, we would have to give up our table and wait for the next available one. We ended up sticking with our original reservations because we were hangry! I understand it must've been hectic for them and everyone since the deal expires that Friday but they should've been prepared or organized it better. Once we were seated, we ordered our broth and food. Everything came out in a reasonable time. The sauce station wasn't as clean and everything was low. There should be someone constantly refilling whatever needs to be refilled. We had ordered the fried tofu skin twice and it never came. We had asked again for the third time towards the end of our meal and that's when we finally got it. We also had a cake for the birthday person and they brought it out unannounced. We have been to 99 Favor for birthdays many times before and they always clean up the table before bringing the cake out. But then we realized it was almost 8pm and they wanted to kick us out. There was also no ventilation inside whatsoever. It was so stuffy! And what happened to giving us plastic bags for our jackets? Will not be coming back to this location until all those Pulsd deals are done with.",0
3309,"Title: A Budget-Friendly Gem with Unforgettable Flavors

I recently stumbled upon an absolute gem via Yelp, and what a fortunate discovery it was! Not only have I been enchanted by the place, but Anthony Bourdain himself sang its praises. Perfect for budget-conscious diners looking for quick, mouth-watering meals, this spot delivers on all fronts with generous portions that promise both freshness and high quality.

During my visit, I couldn't resist their signature spicy cumin lamb noodles - an excellent choice with hand-pulled noodles that easily topped any I've ever tasted. The lamb didn't disappoint either; it was tender, juicy, and perfectly spiced. While the spice levels are adaptable, even 'mild' packs a gratifying punch.

The staff deserves a shoutout for their outstanding service; they were both amiable and accommodating, enhancing the dining experience. Despite its presence across NYC, a West Coast expansion would be welcome. My verdict? An enthusiastic thumbs-up and a must-try recommendation!",1
19842,Got the whole pie and it was huge and really yummy. Fresh ingredients. Waiters were attentive. They offered to take a picture for us. Great for families. You order at the cash register at the end of the counter.,0
17826,Today was the start of my birthday dinner tour. Wow I was really impress with this restaurant as soon as I walked in with the happy and warm greeting . Such a chic Art Deco place with open kitchen plan that brings such a great warm feeling.  Then they bring out homemade bread and butter thats nice and warm with sea salt all over the bread. Started with a sausage and kale pizza that was so crispy but light and airy. Sausage so flavorful with fresh kale. Def so good. Then tried something I never had before crispy duck wings  omg it was amazing and original so crispy outside but tender like butter inside also a nice fresh lemon and olive oil dipping sauce. But what stole the night was the upland cioppino dam I had this dish everywhere and I was blown away with just the flavor of the broth Had inside clams red shrimp mussels white fish jumbo lump crab with gochujang. Wow this is a special dish and worth all the traffic getting caught in rain for this dish.  Wife had the Angus skirt steak with black garlic and Romesco. Cooked perfectly super pink inside and grilled dark and crispy outside. Have to park in a lot and bring your checkbook not a cheap bill. Bit worth every penny.  They gave me a complimentary chocolate chip cookie with sea salt that was heavenly,0
16300,"Open till midnight it's a great spot for after drinks dinner before heading home, but I wouldn't come out of my way for the food itself.The crystal shrimp dumplings are massive and delicious, huge chunks of shrimp, no filler. The lo mien noodles were thicker than what I'm used to at Chinese restaurants, this was alright. All portions are massive. Prices are expensive for Chinese American, but make sense given the size of their space and their location. Service is predictably brusque. Coming in an hour before closing they had already shut down half the restaurant - lights off and chairs on top of tables. As the full tables around us began to empty, those tables were bussed and had their chairs placed on top too. We were brought the check and reminded they were closing in 6 minutes.We got our food wrapped, and by the time I left the bathroom my friends were waiting in the now PITCH BLACK by the door holding my damn jacket because they had been kicked out of their table. I ain't coming back.",0
10259,"Title: Culinary Delights at a Laotian Gem

Last evening's dining experience was nothing short of exceptional. Each dish at this establishment, clearly devoted to Laotian cuisine, was a masterclass in flavor and texture. The Crispy Pork Belly Wraps vanished on the palate, succulent to the last. The Crispy Brussels Sprouts were a revelation of flavor, while the Crunchy Coconut Rice, studded with amazing sausage slices, added a delightful contrast.

The smokiness of the Creekstone Sesame Beef Jerky lingered long after the first taste, its savoriness hitting every note. The Duck Bao featured buns so exquisitely soft, they could easily be the star of the show on their own. And the Sticky Rice? It was elevated to new heights with a spicy bang-bang sauce that was perfectly calibrated.

The atmosphere was as neat as the flavors were complex, with tasteful decor and an ambiance conducive to enjoying a meal. The service was attentive without being overbearing, the portions generous without being overwhelming, and the cleanliness, especially of the bathrooms, did not go unnoticed.

For anyone craving Laotian cuisine, or for those yet to try it, this restaurant is a must-visit. Your taste buds will thank you.",1
2526,"A novel concept restaurant with a mix of Chinese street eats and various noodle soups. The restaurant is open 24 hours a day and has unlimited refill on blanched noodles once you order a soup base, if you so desired for a refill.

20569,"Title: A Pleasant Surprise at a NYC Staple Steakhouse

Last night's unexpected stay in New York City led us to a delightful dining experience at this staple NYC steakhouse. To our surprise, snagging a reservation on a typically bustling Friday night was a breeze. The waitstaff was on point, with our waiter expertly recommending a bottle of wine that was both exquisite and easy on the wallet.

The culinary highlight was the Brooklyn burrata appetizer paired with 'ugly' tomatoes, a dish that could only be described as transcendental cheese artistry. It was, without exaggeration, the best burrata experience of my life, leaving an indelible mark on my palate.

Moving on to the main course, the petite steak was satisfactory, albeit lacking the robust flavor one might anticipate from such an establishment. Nonetheless, the overall dining experience was impressive, offering great food and service at reasonable prices. A definite must-visit for anyone in the city.",1
2697,"Upon visiting the oft-praised eatery, my experience sadly did not mirror the glowing testimonials. The din within the restaurant was overwhelming, to the extent that conversation and contemplation were strenuous. The culinary offerings did little to compensate, as the fare was unremarkable and lackluster. Regrettably, a return visit is not on my agenda.",1
18743,"It's not bad for deep dish. All jokes aside, this was OK and it's cool if you're in the mood for something a little different, it just didn't win me over.The place is small, expect a bit of a wait. They text you when your table is ready. They play great 80's music and have a heavily 80's themed bathroom. Service is excellent: friendly, kind, personable. We ordered a pie with caramelized onions, sausage, and mushrooms. Sauce is on top and it was more crushed tomatoes than sauce. The cheese kind of gets lost. Crust was pretty chewy, more like pie crust which I guess it has to be to hold the jacuzzi of sauce that goes on top. The toppings were sparse, the onions and sausage especially, we had trouble tasting them there seemed to be so little. The whole thing seemed to fall a little flat....like it needed salt?It was a good change of pace, and I'd come in for a drink, but I wouldn't seek out their pizza again.",0
2507,"Title: A Cozy Gem with Fresh Flavors and BYOB Perk

I recently had the pleasure of dining at this charming Italian spot that immediately felt like home, especially with its generous BYOB policy and no corkage fee—an absolute delight for wine enthusiasts like myself!

On a bustling Saturday night (heads up, reservations are a must!), the restaurant's ambiance was warm—perhaps a touch too warm, so dress in layers. As for the food, it was an impressive feast:

- The Calamari (5/5) set a high bar, boasting a perfect breading and an enticingly spicy sauce.
- Fusilli Pesto (4/5) was tasty but a tad salty for my liking, with a generous hand on the pesto.
- Pollo Marsala (5/5) was a revelation, its chicken succulent and smoky sauce captivating.
- Pacherri Marechiaro (5/5) won everyone over with its perfectly cooked, chewy pasta and a sublime garlic and clam concoction.
- Tiramisu (5/5) ended the meal on a classic, satisfying note.

The only minor hiccup was the single bathroom, which did result in a wait.

In summary, this restaurant is a must-visit for anyone craving authentic, fresh Italian cuisine with the bonus of bringing your favorite bottle along. Highly recommended!",1
10061,"More like 3.5 stars. I'm not much of a beer drinker but I like the layout and the idea of putting money on a card & then pouring your beer yourself from the taps lining the wall. Cool ambiance. There also seems to be some good happy-hour specials that vary depending on the day of the week though I wish they extended longer since I'd likely never make it there before 7. I happened to randomly end up at Tap Haus because I was in the area around 4:30pm on a Friday after an appointment, and starving as I hadn't eaten lunch. At the recommendation of the waiter I got the chicken pesto as a wrap but I should have gone with my first instincts & gotten the tacos or a burger. The wrap was the wrong way to go because the grilled tomato made it totally soggy & falling apart, with hot tomato juice squirting everywhere. Couldn't really taste much pesto or the cheese. Came with fries that I wasn't a big fan of. For $15 I wasn't particularly happy. I washed that down with a rose cider they had that was good and the free shot of Titos that you get for checking in on Yelp. I would still come back to see if I like the self-serve beers; would be a nice place to chill with friends. It was dead when I got there but by 5pm had filled up.",0

16583,"Restaurant Review: Hidden Gem for Sushi Enthusiasts

Right in the vicinity of Grand Central lies a high-end Japanese gem that beckons the discerning sushi lover. Having passed by post-work, I took the plunge for dinner, missing the famed lunch specials. A timely arrival granted me the tail-end of Happy Hour - a delightful pairing of beer and succulent fried chicken for a mere $10.

The call of the evening was casual sushi, with an emphasis on spice. The rolls we selected did not disappoint. Each piece was expertly crafted, bursting with flavor without being masked by an overbearing rice fortress. The spicy selections stood out, hinting at the quality of offerings yet to be explored.

The restaurant's ace up its sleeve – a fish farm in Japan – enables a tantalizing proposition: premium sushi at surprisingly modest prices. The negitoro and torotaku rolls, usually tagged at a premium elsewhere, are a steal here at just $13.

My first visit only skimmed the surface of what seems to be an extensive and promising menu. The experience was an invitation to return – and I intend to RSVP.",1
18831,"Title: Late Night Bite Delight

Last night, my craving for pizza was superbly satisfied at a cozy restaurant that offered both comfort and convenience with its ample seating. The ambiance was inviting for a late snack session, though a hiccup with the credit card machine meant a dash for cash - a tip for fellow NYC diners, always carry some cash!

I opted for a slice of Spinach and Mushroom pizza which, despite the canned mushrooms (a familiar sight from my own pantry), didn't disappoint. The star of the show was undoubtedly the crust – a delightful combination of crunchy, light, and toasty perfection.

Peering through the glass case, I was tempted by the wide array of pizza flavors on offer, all ready to be devoured within minutes after a quick oven reheat. And while the pizza hit the spot, the Calzones caught my eye for a future visit – they looked just as tantalizing.

In summary, for a quick, enjoyable pizza fix, this spot is worth the visit; I'm already looking forward to my next trip!",1
10597,"Writing this review after getting delivery from them twice now. We never request, but their deliver with their pies always come with a surplus of spices (red pepper flakes, garlic, and oregano), paper plates, and a stack napkins. Their delivery always come faster than their estimated time.. even today (super bowl night)!But onto the important question. Is their pizza good? Short answer: yes. Longer answer: get the pepperoni and mushroom (proof in picture: only cheese Bc the roni/shroom was gone in 5 secs)",0
20401,"Title: A Gem in the Upper East Side

My first visit to this charming eatery was nothing short of exceptional. The anticipation had been building, and I'm thrilled to say the experience surpassed my expectations. The arancini and caprese panuozzi started us off right, the latter leaving me longing for a dip of tomato sauce to elevate it even further. 

The star of the meal, however, was undoubtedly the burrata pie. Its Neapolitan-style pizza, with a delightfully soupy center, fluffy crust, and quality toppings, could easily become a habitual craving. Though I'm eager to explore more of their offerings, another round of the burrata pie wouldn't disappoint.

The penne with eggplant also deserves a special mention - cooked al dente with eggplant prepared to perfection, it was a wonderful surprise. In summary, this restaurant is a fantastic addition to the Upper East Side dining scene, and I'm already planning my next visit.",1
13777,"I recently grabbed a bite at a place offering 99-cent slices and $8 pies - an absolute steal for New York pizza.

If you're looking to satisfy your pizza cravings without breaking the bank, this spot is a must-visit.",1
13654,"Proong Noodle has officially claimed the title for the best noodles in NYC in my book. This gem stands out among the myriad noodle shops dotting the city. Unlike other spots, Proong doesn't skimp on any aspect, particularly when it comes to their Tonkatsu ramen. It strikes the perfect balance: rich in flavor without being overly dense or salty, making it a satisfying bowl of comfort without feeling weighed down.

The generosity of Proong is unmistakable when it comes to their meat servings. Picture substantial, succulent slices of pork belly that make their noodle bowls a carnivore's delight – a rarity in a city where you'd often pay top dollar for just a morsel.

Their Baa mee egg noodles are another crowd-pleaser. With a delightful savory-sweet profile, they're cooked just right – avoiding the all-too-common noodle pitfall of being overdone. The Crispy Chicken Baa Mee, with its light and sweet thin egg noodles, is my personal favorite.

In short, Proong Noodle doesn't just serve good noodles; they serve perfection in a bowl. I haven't ventured beyond their noodle dishes yet, but given the high bar they've set, I'm confident the rest of the menu is just as commendable. And I can't wait to work my way through it.",1
18174,"I recently discovered a gem of a restaurant that deviates delightfully from the usual Chinatown locales, offering traditional Asian-style clay pot cuisine that is both authentic and innovative. I indulged in two clay pot combinations: a savory blend of Beef and Pork, and a daring mix of Eel and Chinese sausage. Each dish was impressive, with rice perfectly crisped at the bottom, absorbing the rich flavors. A dash of soy sauce elevated the experience further, adding a flavorful zest to the meal.

These hearty clay pots also include a generous serving of veggies, tofu, and corn at no extra charge, making it a satisfying meal for one. The ambiance of the place is just as inviting, with a setting that enhances dining companionably. Without hesitation, I recommend this restaurant for anyone seeking a fulfilling meal and a pleasant atmosphere.",1
19937,"Title: A Sunday Brunch Affair at Sonnyboy

I recently ventured to Sonnyboy for a Sunday brunch experience and found it to be quite delightful, with a couple of hiccups along the way. Upon taking advantage of their Yelp Waitlist feature, make sure to physically check in; our name was mistakenly removed for failing to do so, resulting in a 40-minute wait.

Once seated, their smashed avocado with a perfectly poached egg did not disappoint. The generous portion was elevated by the unexpected crunch of crispy pistachios and the tang of feta cheese. The Hotcake was another winner, smothered in an excellent blueberry sauce that added just the right amount of sweetness.

In conclusion, despite the initial wait-time confusion, Sonnyboy served up a decent brunch that tantalizes the taste buds. I'm intrigued enough to return and sample more of what their menu has to offer.",1
10938,"Had an early dinner on a Saturday evening. When we arrived the place was fairly empty. We were greeted by a friendly man and shown to a table for two with comfy padded chairs. Tables are well spaced so we felt relaxed and happy.Started with a reasonably priced bottle of brut prosecco with a black cork (forgot the name) suggested by our server, dry but not overly so. Shared the burrata app, a perfect globe of ultra creamy white cheese nestled on thinly sliced prosciutto. We've tried the burrata at many places and Angeletto's version was one of the most fresh and pristine we've had. I love branzino so ordered that as a main. Mama mia, I didn't expect it to be flamed and carefully filleted tableside, that was a wonderful surprise! Large portion of fish with nice hint of salt from the crust that came with sauteed potato/pepper side dish. Hubbie said his seafood risotto was creamy and fresh. Chocolate hazelnut cake was a wonderful sweet nutty finish to the meal.  Service was friendly and professional. Water glasses were filled promptly throughout the meal without asking. We left by 7:00PM and the place was filling up by then, no surprise given Angeletto's wonderful food and service.",0
2177,"Title: A Ball of a Time at Great Balls!

If you're on the hunt for the perfect arancini, look no further than Great Balls! Their menu offers an array of delectably stuffed arancini with robust Italian influences. The filling choices are tantalizing, ranging from the savory Classic Ragu to the innovative Pizza, Bianca Verde, Sausage & Peppers, and even a Nutella-filled dessert option. A surprising delight was the Mexican-inspired Tacorita, which held its own against the traditional favorites.

Each ball is a masterpiece of deep-fried perfection: golden, crisply fried exteriors giving way to molten, flavorful centers, served piping hot. The presentation is charmingly clever—an egg carton serving as a six-pack container, ingeniously absorbing any residual oil and ensuring your arancini remain uncrushed during transit.

For those looking to channel their inner chef, the option to take home frozen arancini is available. But, fair warning: these professionals set a high bar. Whether you dine in or take out, Great Balls secures its spot as the go-to for anyone craving this Italian delicacy with a twist.",1

Chewy noodles, abundant meat, and a savory spicy sauce that had damn near what I would call a punch of cumin flavor. Loved these.I opted for the spicy tingly (because of the Szechuan peppercorns) beef noodles and even though the sauces looked the same in both dishes, the taste of this sauce was much sweeter and more pungent than the lamb one. Still enjoyed these, but they were definitely less memorable.And yes, these were both super spicy; however, they had the right kind of heat - addictive while eating, but quick to fade from your mouth when done.Xi'an might be a local chain and these noodles might seem common if you live in NYC, but it is not at all easy to hunt down a meal like this where we live.

18327,"Title: A Tale of Two Joju Branches

Having been a long-time patron of Joju in Elmhurst, the original gem that captured my heart with its authentic charm, I recently ventured into their new city branch with high hopes but left with mixed feelings. The new spot swaps the neighborhood feel for a hipster café atmosphere, complete with fancy packaging that elevates the price tag to over $10.

I tried the sweet *** and the ***bogogi*** sandwich. Both were delectable, but the sweet *** won me over with its rich pate, tender meat slices, and a more complex flavor profile thanks to a generous variety of fillings. However, the sandwiches arrived in boxes, which, though they traveled well, seemed unnecessary and a departure from the traditional paper bag packaging that adds to the authentic experience at various Viet restaurants and Chinatown locales.

While the new branch delivers on taste, the original Joju's charm and value are irreplaceable to me. I'll be returning to Elmhurst where the prices are friendlier and the vibe feels more like home, avoiding the city's inflated costs and Instagram-worthy interiors.",1

I ventured to this pizza joint on a late Sunday evening, arriving around 9pm. Anticipation made the 30-minute wait bearable, but the service hiccup at the cashier where I was overcharged by $10 on a $4.90 pepperoni slice left a sour taste. Luckily, I caught the error in time, though I was caught off-guard by the additional charge for using a credit card instead of cash.

The pizza itself was a letdown; the pepperoni was savory, but overshadowed by an overly greasy topping and a bread-heavy base. On a brighter note, the thin crust Margherita pizza was delightful, aligning with my preference for less doughy, classic varieties. Despite the cashier mishap and the greasy pepperoni slice, the quick service for the Margherita pie redeemed part of the evening.",1

Service was swift; our bartender generous with the pours. My vanilla bean French toast was an absolute treat, elevated by sumptuous caramelized bananas. The Gatsby cocktail was as aesthetically pleasing as it was tasty. My husband’s short rib hash was a savory hit. The Smith left such an impression, I'm eager to return for the Sicilian baked eggs.

14337,"Title: Mixed Feelings at an Aesthetically Pleasing Eatery

Upon entering this restaurant, one can't help but be charmed by its stunning decor—a feast for the eyes indeed. However, the appeal starts to wane once you delve deeper into the dining experience. The culinary offerings, while possibly aiming for rich flavor, unfortunately tip the scales towards the overly greasy side, detracting from what could otherwise be a delightful meal.

Additionally, the service, albeit prompt, comes with a dose of overzealous water refills that can distract from the otherwise leisurely pace of dining. The enthusiasm of the waitstaff, while appreciated, overshoots when it comes to the frequent topping off of glasses.

An unexpected and rather disconcerting element of our visit was the palpable tension at the entryway. Witnessing the hosts embroiled in disputes with a neighboring restaurant cast a shadow over what should have been a welcoming first impression.

Furthermore, navigating the menu can be a bit of a gamble. The absence of descriptive images or the ability of the waiters to aptly describe the dishes means what arrives at your table may not meet expectations. A diner's anticipation is quickly deflated when the dish presented bears little resemblance to what was imagined.

In summary, while this restaurant dazzles with its visual appeal, it falls short in culinary execution and overall service harmony. A few thoughtful tweaks could greatly enhance the overall experience for patrons seeking a meal that lives up to the establishment's visual promise.",1
15823,"Title: Mixed Bag at [Restaurant Name]

My recent dining experience at [Restaurant Name] offered a stellar beginning but was marred by a disappointing main course. Service was impeccable, with attentive and friendly staff ensuring a pleasant atmosphere.

The highlight of the meal was undoubtedly the appetizer sampler, a delightful assortment of bite-sized treats perfect for sharing among a group of 4-5. This is a must-try, especially for those indecisive about which starters to choose.

Unfortunately, the main course failed to live up to the promising start. I opted for the daily special, a red snapper with coconut sauce paired with pineapple-infused rice. The first taste seemed promising, but what followed was a letdown, with the texture of the fish resembling cardboard and the dish overall being exceedingly dry. In vain, I attempted to salvage it with more sauce and even sampled the roasted branzino from a friend's plate, but to no avail. Both fish dishes suffered from the same dryness issue, ultimately rendering them impossible for me to finish.

In summary, while the appetizers at [Restaurant Name] are a hit, I would advise steering clear of the fish entrees.",1
19675,"Nestled in the vibrant bustle of Little Italy, this gem offers an excellent selection of pizza by the slice at wallet-friendly prices. No matter your choice, each variety is a surefire hit, blending authentic flavors with quality ingredients. A must-visit spot for any pizza aficionado.",1
1569,"Upon visiting this much-talked-about eatery, my expectations were met with disappointment. The sparsity of patrons now makes sense. The food, notably the bacon cheeseburger set at a steep $24, lacked the culinary finesse one might expect for the price, especially within New York City's competitive dining scene. The burger itself was unremarkably messy, and both the fries and my companion's tater tots suffered from an excess of salt. 

Incorporating a pint of beer escalated the total to a rather unjustifiable $40, after tipping for a meal that could only be described as pedestrian at best. Although the establishment boasts an impressive beer selection and a multitude of TVs for the sports enthusiast, these features do not offset the shortcomings of the kitchen. 

The venue does hold potential as a social hub, with an upstairs bar replete with games, which could merit a return visit during a livelier hour, and when not restricted by private events. However, as it stands, the experience left much to be desired in both value and culinary delight.",1
12189,"Love this Thai fusion. Came in for lunch and tried their lunch specials with appetizers, and everything was good.We got the leaf-wrapped chicken, which was grilled and then fried. Dipping it in the sweet sauce was very yummy. Definitely worth the messiness for unwrapping it.Got a red curry shrimp and a garlic beef. I love both as you really cannot go wrong with garlic and red curry. It's fusion so they got broccoli and such in the dish, expected and delicious, so no complaints.The sides were less impressive. A little on the oily side and the salad too sweet with the peanut sauce. I like their soup better.Good service and short wait. Nice decoration and vibes!",0
17551,"Title: A Taste of Italy in SoHo - Piccola Cucina Osteria

During an impromptu day in NYC, I seized the opportunity to catch up with a friend for lunch at Piccola Cucina Osteria in SoHo. Tucked near her office, this spot came highly recommended for its lunch specials – a tip I'm ever grateful for.

The seating gods were in our favor, granting us an ideal sidewalk spot that lent itself brilliantly to people-watching. Confronted with a tempting menu, our decision-making was put to the test. However, it was the $11 lunch special that left me utterly astounded – particularly the Astice pasta, which promised lobster at an unforeseen value.

Skepticism was soon replaced by sheer delight as I savored the succulent lobster. Despite the lower portion compared to the dinner offering, the quality and quantity exceeded expectations. My friend's ragu was equally commendable, with us happily sharing our plates.

The bistro's ambiance struck a chord with me, echoing the spirit of Italy in a way I could only imagine, having never visited. Coupled with the heartwarming service, Piccola Cucina Osteria didn't just serve up a meal; it delivered an experience. For Italian cravings in NYC, this is a must-visit.",1
16953,"Title: A Delightful Dining Experience During Restaurant Week

I recently visited this gem during Restaurant Week, and I must say, it lived up to the hype. Despite our 8pm arrival, the place was buzzing, and the ambiance struck a perfect chord for both friendly gatherings and romantic dates.

The menu was a parade of hits and a few mild misses. The yellowfin tuna tartare, with its fresh tuna paired with mango sorbet and avocado, was an absolute triumph. It's a dish I can't recommend enough. The crab salad atop avocado toast, while fresh, lacked the same wow factor but was pleasantly executed.

The steak skirt caught my attention next – thin yet satisfying, boasting a richness of flavor that allowed it to stand proudly alone, without the need of the accompanying sauce. Moving on to dessert, the cream brûlée with its delightful egg base was delightful, even though the coconut topping wasn't to my personal taste. As someone who isn't overly fond of coconut, I was nonetheless compelled to consider a reorder, which speaks volumes.

The chocolate-covered strawberry, a visual surprise with its deceptive red hue, revealed a delightful combination of cake and pistachio cream that won me over. To complement our meal, we opted for sangria and frozen rosé – both light in alcohol content and utterly enjoyable.

My overall experience was so memorable that the promise of seasonal menus has me eager to return. This restaurant has earned a top spot on my list.",1
11277,"My dining companions and I were treated to a delightful culinary experience at this bustling spot on a Saturday night. The shared appetizers, including the savory octopus balls and a fresh, well-balanced poke bowl, set a high standard that the main courses maintained. The bowls of ramen served to us were nothing short of exceptional. Opting for the vegetarian ramen with an egg, I was impressed by its rich flavor, proving that healthier options can also be incredibly satisfying.

Notably, the restaurant managed to accommodate us promptly at 6 PM, but it wasn't long before it was fully occupied by 6:30 PM, a testament to its popularity and the quality of its offerings. If you're planning a visit, an early arrival is advisable unless you're willing to wait for what is undoubtedly a worthwhile dining experience.",1
10203,"Title: Style Over Substance at a Trendy Food Court

I usually avoid the flashy, overpriced food courts that mimic upscale marketplaces, but a group decision led me reluctantly to this gastronomic maze. Amid the plethora of stations offering a variety of options, the fare looked uninspired and failed to pique my interest. Reluctantly, I chose a Tuna Salad—adequate at best, but hardly worth the effort it took to get it.

The experience was marred by the inconvenience of queuing to order, then enduring a long wait for food preparation, followed by the hassle of self-service: securing a table, finding and relocating chairs, and sourcing water, napkins, and utensils. Efficiency and comfort were sorely missing.

For those looking for a more refined dining experience, I recommend seeking out a traditional restaurant where a dedicated owner or manager focuses on a select menu, ensuring each dish is crafted to perfection. In contrast, this food court felt like the McDonald's of Spain—abundant in options but lacking soul and quality.

Final Verdict: Skip the spectacle of these culinary bazaars and opt for a place where the food takes center stage.",1
10607,"So so so so so good. This is how every pasta should taste like. If you don't know what al dente is, come here. We ordered the carbonara and the rabbit dish. Both were good but the carbonara is amazing. We got to sit in front of the chefs which I didn't mind, we did not have reservation so they sat us there. This is a place I would def come back for.",0
2478,"Title: A Gem in the Heart of the City – A Review of JFK Jr's Favorite Hangout

If you're looking for a vibrant spot with a rich slice of history, this restaurant is an absolute must-visit. As a group of six, we loved the convenience of joining the waitlist while on the move, which allowed us to walk in to a ready table upon arrival – talk about efficient!

The menu diversity is a real crowd-pleaser; whether you're in the mood for a light salad, a hearty burger, decadent pancakes, or crispy waffles, there's something for everyone. And let's talk about the coffee – simply fabulous. It's not just the food that stands out; the decor adds to the establishment's charm, creating an inviting and friendly atmosphere that makes you feel right at home.

The layout of the restaurant is unique, with an open-concept bathroom area featuring a communal sink – a modern touch that adds to its appeal. Whether you're a history buff seeking to walk in the footsteps of JFK Jr. or just in search of a delightful meal in a cozy setting, this place ticks all the boxes. I'm already planning my next visit!",1
13934,"We were looking for a thai place near the AMC Lincoln Square theatre and found this little gem. The decor inside is so cute and we only had to wait ~10 minutes on a Friday night!The menu has a bunch of options - noodles, rice, curries, duck, etc. They also have photos of the food options (some of them) which made it harder for us to choose what to get! In the end, we opted for the fried calamari appetizer. This was just okay because even though it was fresh, it wasn't as crispy as we would've liked. We overlooked this because the entrees we got were amazing! We got the green curry with pork (amazing with all of the veggies and the curry sauce was great to dip with the extra roti we asked for), as well as the duck drunken noodles. This place has above average prices for Thai food, but there's not that many more options in the area. Plus - the service is great!",0
13460,"I came here with a group of friends and I'm so happy that I was able to check this place out.I made reservations online, super easy and quick. I came here with a group of friends, we were seated right away, and we were assisted pretty quick as well.I noticed within our time there, the place had quickly filled up.My 2 friends and I ordered the famous burger, and I was blown away. I really liked the pretzel bun, it was soft and had a great taste. The caramelized onions and pickle were a great combo, but it was the sauce that made the burger. Everything came together wonderfully, I did eat a piece of the burger meat on its own, just because it felt like too much was going on. The burger patty was very good, perfectly cooked and not overwhelming.My other two friends ended up getting the pizza and the chicken sandwich. The pizza was great, and they thought the flavors were a great combo. I believe the liked the chicken sandwich a bit more. It was perfectly crisp and seasoned. The cocktails were pretty good too! As we were leaving, there was a line of people outside the waiting to be seated.All in all I thought this was a great place, I thought the burger was worth its price.",0
14031,"This was located inside of Eataly so we decided to give it a try given most Eataly places are great.

2565,"Title: A Sweet Escape for Dessert Lovers

We popped into this gem of a spot on a whim for desserts and were not disappointed. Our waiter, Isaac, was the epitome of attentive and friendly service, enhancing our experience considerably.

The star of the show was undoubtedly the chocolate vanilla s'mores ice cream. Its portion was humorously large, dwarfing our appetites, but every spoonful of this decadent treat was a sheer delight. Sharing is advised unless you're up for a delicious challenge!

The tiramisu was another hit, balancing flavors expertly—a classic done right. As for the drinks, the mocha madness and finale chocolate were a treat for the taste buds. Though we wished for a bit more strength in them, they were still enjoyable.

Overall, this place is a must-visit for those with a sweet tooth in the area. We left satisfied and certain that when the next chocolate craving hits, we'll be back.",1
12486,"After a five-year hiatus, I revisited this charming restaurant and I was delighted to find that my beloved veg casserole has only improved with time.

Without hesitation, I'm elevating my rating to a flawless 5-star experience. To commemorate the occasion, I've added a photo to capture the essence of this delectable meal.",1
1840,"Title: Mixed Feelings on a Popular Spot

After being lured in by glowing Yelp reviews, I ventured into this much-talked-about restaurant, only to find a space tighter than anticipated. Despite a reservation, the cramped quarters were the first hint this may not be my scene.

The ambiance was far from conducive for a friendly catch-up; the noise level escalated to the point where conversation became a shouting match against the surrounding clamor. This, however, was a minor discomfort compared to the behavior of an older male waiter, whose inappropriate attention toward female patrons was as unsettling as it was obvious – a disappointing validation of prior reviews.

In the midst of this, there was a culinary highlight: the penne alla vodka. This dish alone shone brightly, tempting me to consider a takeout option in the future.

Service was a patchwork of different servers attending to us, which, while not detrimental, sowed a bit of confusion.

In sum, my return is unlikely. Perhaps those seeking a quieter experience and the exceptional penne alla vodka might find off-peak hours more rewarding.",1
2839,"Came here on a Friday afternoon, not too long of a wait (30 mins). My partner and I were seated and received our first roll in a few minutes! I did the 5 piece and my partner had the 6 piece. Both sets included: toro, lobster, crab, yellowtail and bay scallop. You are also able to substitute due to allergens or preference. Service is very speedy. It's not a glamorous sushi place, it's more casual and quick but very good hand rolls. The fish quality is pretty good and very fresh.",0

13179,"Solid 4 stars for Taim! I ordered the falafel (green) on a pita for lunch with added pickled onions and tzatziki. Overall the flavors were great and the pita was the perfect size for a lunch portion. Also, urbanspaces where Taim is located in was a cool spot itself. You order at Taim, and can sit and eat anywhere within the urbanspaces location. I would stop in and check it out if you're in the area and not looking for a full blown sit down restaurant meal.",0
13151,"I recently revisited Barbetta, an Italian gem that I fondly remembered from a business trip over two decades ago. The restaurant has withstood the test of time beautifully, delivering an authentic Italian experience to my colleagues and me. As we settled into the serene garden on a gorgeous evening, the charm of the place was undeniable.

With the choice of a pre-fixe dinner theatre menu at $58 for three courses or the extensive à la carte, we went with the latter for a broader taste of what Barbetta offers. The smoked salmon and prosciutto with melon appetizers set a high bar, both flawlessly executed—I even found myself longing for a bagel to accompany the salmon.

The highlight surely was the fresh pasta with tomato sauce; it was so delightful that we couldn’t resist ordering it twice. The main courses—succulent lamb chops, fork-tender bracciolo, and some of the best grilled swordfish I've had—were all exceptional. We concluded the meal sharing three delectable desserts: a zesty lemon torte, a rich hazelnut cake, and an elegantly poached pear.

Barbetta's wine list impressed us as well, with two bottles of Barolo perfectly complementing our meal. The prices, while not cheap, were completely justified by the sublime food, atmosphere, and overall experience.

Perfect for special occasions or a pre-theatre dinner, Barbetta is a must-visit on Restaurant Row. With its excellent pre-fixe option and an irresistible à la carte menu, I won’t wait another 20 years to come back.",1

The hostess and waiter were very friendly and did not treat us any differently because of the Groupon which was must appreciated.The food was excellent! We started with the Baked Clams which were wonderful and for entrees we had the Chilean Sea Bass, the Lamb Chops and the Bone-in Ribeye, none of which disappointed. If anything, though the Apple Strudel for dessert was good, perhaps we had expected more.  Nevertheless, looking forward to going back to Bobby Van's with or without Groupon.",0

We got a basket of the viennoiseries and let me tell you about those amazing croissants! So flakey and perfect ! It didn't come w a danish though . The oysters were AMAZING get these regardless of whatever else you get.The lamb navarin was probably the best thing on the menu to get . And the presentation was so beautiful too . I got the steak and eggs which was also pretty delicious . The dressing on the side salads on all our meals were amazing. Finally , I wish we had gotten pancakes or French toast as dessert because their dessert cart was mediocre at best . I really really wanted to love this place . But it was a little underwhelming. The host was really nice and the check in process was well done . And I know I'm  being overly picky but only bcoz this was a pricey meal 1. The guy hardly refilled my water , it was really annoying actually. 2. So after we got individual dessert from the cart , they brought out my complimentary dessert which was one of the only ones we didn't pick like why not ask someone from my party which dessert to pick or just comp one of the desserts we already picked . Made zero sense . It was a pretty crappy dessert to . Rather would not have had it .3. The cappuccino was mediocre at best and I think it's priced at $8 or somethingProbably will come back for dinner and I'm sure that'll get a 5 star review",0

229,"Title: A Tasty Midtown Gem for Lunch

I recently stumbled upon a fantastic lunch spot in midtown that left a great impression. The menu presented a challenge with mouth-watering options like the banh mi, which I've heard boasts the perfect bread—not too hard, unlike others. I went with the rice bowl topped with pork and wasn't disappointed. The pork was a delightful balance of sweet and savory, met with a generous helping of toppings. 

I added an egg for $1.50, although in hindsight, it wasn't an essential add-on unless you've got a serious craving. While the inclusion of items like ""kimchi"" and ""bulgogi"" seemed a bit out of place to me, I can't speak to the bulgogi, but the kimchi in my bowl was just okay, lacking the punch of authentic kimchi. 

All in all, the quality food at reasonable prices makes this spot worth a return visit, even for dinner. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a solid meal in midtown.",1
12846,"I recently stumbled upon an outstanding ramen spot and had to share my experience. Naruto Ramen served up what could be the best bowl of ramen I've ever had—noodles and sliced pork perfected to softness, all swimming in a soy sauce-based broth that was rich in flavor without overdoing the salt. I threw in some extra corn for good measure. Couldn't resist trying the kurobuta sausages either; they were wonderfully smoked and brimming with juiciness. The atmosphere was just as delightful as the food, with a warm and welcoming vibe complemented by the sweet staff. All in all, it made for a flawless dinner experience.",1
14257,"The food at Nightmarket... tastes like the food you get at home. Think those big Taipei nightmarkets, with all the streetfood goodies right in front of your face. The aromas, the smell, the senses, just amazing, and I think Nightmarket tries its best to recapitulate those feelings and vibes in the East Village. This is such a great casual Taiwanese food - I don't expect it to have an expansive menu, since its such a small shop and runned by a husband and wife duo (Thank you for hosting us!). The menu only has about ~10 items give or take, each priced between $7-$15 depending on the item itself. But with a small menu, they really do knock it out of the park in terms of delivering on the flavors that instantly hit you with a wave of nostalgia. I got the Lu Rou Fan with pork chop (Braised pork over rice) and the firecracker tofu (total $20), while my friends got the beef noodle soup and another got a scallion burrito. My Lu Rou Fan was delicious - the sauce was incredible, pairs really well with the rice, and the pork chops were crispy, airy, and moist. Well done. But my favorite has got to be the spicy tofu (firecracker tofu). These were incredible! I think that has got to be Nightmarket's signature dish. It had a great kick to it, and each bite you feel like you're going to crave for more. My friends enjoyed their beef noodle soup and scallion burrito. One did mention he really enjoyed how rich the broth was, and the noodles were chewy and the beef had a great texture to it. I'm impressed with the food at Nightmarket, and the hospitality the owner and his wife showed us that night. Thank you so much! I'll definitely come by hungry for more ;D",0
2316,"I stopped by this spot the other evening after a happy hour event, craving a quick bite and decided to grab a mushroom and pepperoni slice. The pizza was decent – flavorful enough to satisfy an immediate hunger. However, the slice did err on the smaller side, especially considering it was priced on par with other two-topping slices you'd find around NYC. While it didn’t quite earn a spot on my list of must-try pizzerias, I wouldn't mind grabbing another slice if I find myself in the neighborhood with a craving for something swift and savory.",1
1716,Took a friend here for a Friday night steak dinner. His first time and my second at this chain. Made reservation and no problem being seated as soon as we got here. They had a surf and turf special listed but just wanted the steak dinner. We both got the 10 oz. ribeye dinner. I got mine cooked medium with onions and broccoli. My friend who is a bit of a finicky eater ordered well done with corn and corn. He didn't think they would actually do well done and was very pleased with his steak. We also ordered garlic bread and mashed potatoes as extras. Over all a really good dinner and converted him to a fan. Really good service and my only wish not granted was mushrooms.,0
15157,"Nothing like ramen when the weather drops by like, 3 whole degrees. It's the first thing I crave when it is even remotely chilly out. Or even just, not hot out. Like, if maybe I should wear a light sweater just in case, I want ramen. Our table of 8 got a table right away around 11:45, always a plus. We started off with a few appetizers: the takoyaki and the shrimp shumai. The takoyaki was like a fried octopus ball, it came 4 to an order and were really tasty. It was more creamy than just fried dough, which I really liked. The shrimp shumai were also soooo good. Basically just shrimp dumplings without the breading. Get all the apps because they are that good and also they are 50% when you order a lunch entree. I got the tonkatsu ramen and it was delicious. The broth was packed with flavor, the pork was so soft, and the noodles were plentiful and perfectly cooked. I could barely finish half of it, the bowl was so big. I definitely recommend this spot.

My partner and I recently treated ourselves to a post-Valentine's day meal at [Restaurant Name] and we were glad we did. First tip: make a reservation, as tables are close together – you might overhear neighboring conversations, but the food's worth it.

The menu can tempt overordering, as we discovered. Starting with the crepe pancake, which arrived larger than expected and perfectly crispy, was an ideal shared appetizer. We decided to pass on the fresh coconut, since it was light on juice and heavy on table space.

For mains, the Bun Bo Hue was a standout – a spicy, flavor-packed delight with generous meat portions that easily fed two. Meanwhile, the Madame Vo Pho with extra short rib was indulgently meaty, though the rib addition seemed unnecessary.

In short, [Restaurant Name] offers a bang for your buck with some must-try dishes. Just remember to save room for the main event!",1
2229,"This is a fantastic choice for Indian lunch buffet and a great value at the low price of $14.95! The interior is lovely with beautifully colorful and ornate lamps displayed at the bar area. There were quite a few options at the buffet and we were also served warm naan bread. I usually order mango lassi whenever I'm at an Indian restaurant, but the price was $6 which I thought was too high. It turns out that was a good choice because I was so full from all the food!  Lunch buffet offered: Bismati rice, fish curry, chicken masala, onion fritters, chicken tandoori, cauliflower, saag paneer, lentils, spinach saag, peas + broccoli, salad. Desserts included mango pudding and flan. My favorites were fish curry, chicken masala, and onion fritters. The fish was perfectly tender and the curry sauce was smooth and mild, with plenty of tasty seasoning. The chicken was juicy and succulent. The sauce was wonderfully flavorful and melt in your mouth delicious! The onion fritters were delightfully crispy and light. I thought that the spinach was a little soggy and the chicken tandoori was a bit dry and on the bland side. The rest of the offerings were pretty good though. The salad was very fresh and there were many different toppings and types of dressing. The vegetable dishes were full of flavor and cooked on really yummy sauces.I enjoyed the desserts as well. The mango pudding was incredibly scrumptious with the strong taste of mango. It reminded me of a mango lassi. The flan was slightly caramelized and quite sweet. Service was decent. The waiters were friendly and competent. I would definitely return and maybe try something from their menu that was not available at the lunch buffet.",0
18563,"Title: A Delightful Dining Experience with a Hiccup at the Finish

My boyfriend and I visited the restaurant on a bustling Friday night, having made reservations nearly a month earlier to ensure a spot in the main dining room. The $134 price tag for the pre-fixed menu seemed justified, considering it included gratuity.

The ambiance of the venue was pleasant and inviting. I opted for the Hamachi as my starter, which set a high bar for the evening's courses. The striped bass that followed was the star of my meal, served with a luscious sauce that perfectly complemented the fish. The cheese plate that rounded off my meal was a delightful finish. Equally worthy of praise was the pre-dinner bread - an unexpected highlight.

My boyfriend chose the lamb entree — his review was tepid, deeming it just satisfactory. Service throughout the night was attentive, although, as the evening progressed and the restaurant got busier, we experienced a slight hiccup in finding someone to present our check.

Despite this minor issue, our overall experience was thoroughly enjoyable, and I would recommend the restaurant to those seeking a refined culinary experience.",1

1673,"Title: Cozy Vibes and Craft Brews at Local Pub

I recently had the pleasure of visiting a fantastic pub known for its exceptional selection of around two dozen craft beers on tap and a comprehensive full bar. The Big Hugs stout from Half Acre Brewing was a highlight, perfectly complemented by a delicious plate of cheese curds.

The ambiance was just as impressive as the drinks - the interior boasted a rustic charm, with plenty of space to unwind and a comfortable setting. They also offer an inviting outdoor patio, ideal for those looking to enjoy their meal al fresco.

What truly set this pub apart was the engaging company, particularly a memorable conversation with the friendly bartender. Our shared interests in Greek college culture and figure skating sparked a connection, and we had fun exchanging views on the sport and discussing revered figures like Michelle Kwan and the duo Hubbell/Donohue.

The social and warm atmosphere of the pub made for an excellent experience that came highly recommended by other Yelpers. A visit here is well worth it for the beer aficionados, food lovers, and anyone looking for a good chat in a convivial setting.",1

Our water to servewas placed within Swell bottles - which I enjoyed! It felt so much more sanitary and kept our water nice and cold. BUT - what really amazed me was how thoughtful they were in individual comfort. The stools literally seats you lower or higher depending on which way you spin it!!! OMG, was so amazed. How thoughtful for people of varying height to get comfortable at their own leisure.Food wise we should've tried the pre-fix dinner course bc our items were in it. But no regrets bc the food was amazing. We ordered the steak to share. The lettuce was a bit spoiled looking, def not fresh and had some brown gunk on it so we stopped using it to wrap the meat. Luckily the steak was amazing as is too. The wagyu ramen was soo rich and flavorful.

The ambience has cool vibes to it and the view by the window is cool! You get to see everyone walking in kTown.We tried the plum soju bottle to share for 2 ($13). The flavor was recommended by our waiter. It was ok, it tasted like cough syrup so I probably would've preferred the mango flavor instead.For food, we shared the soy garlic chicken wings and nachos. The soy garlic wings were pretty small, some were half the size of my pinky but they were only around $13 for 10 wings during happy hour and had little pieces of fried garlic slices on them. Yummy! The nachos were AMAZINGLY crispy, had so much cheesy goodness on them, and yummy guacamole.

Alphonso's also delivers. can't speak to the pizza--never had it. i have had the Sausage & Peppers on a hero roll. it was solidly good: grilled onions and peppers, the right amount of sauce, and sliced sausage on a soft long roll. wish there was more sausage on it, so it was an overstuffed sando. however no complaints otherwise.very shareable. ~$10 the fries are the real winner here. crispy outside and soft potato insides. the fries have that double-fried/batter crunch. only $3.50 for a hefty portion. delivery is fast if you're in the area aka  Lower East Side. drops mic cuz food is lifei outzzz",0
3260,"I recently tried the shrimp roll from a Mealpal offer at a restaurant on West 25th (not to be confused with a location on the East side), and I was pleasantly surprised. The roll was prepared fresh, with a lovely drizzle of butter added just before packing—this attention to detail ensured no sogginess in the meal. The shrimp, slightly cooler than room temperature, was perfectly fine by my standards. The roll's bread had a satisfying crunch that complemented the well-flavored shrimp. While the portion size left a little to be desired, it was reasonable for a Mealpal selection. Overall, the taste was great with a generous amount of shrimp, making for a satisfying lunchtime experience.",1
10054,"Was a bit disappointed with the taste of the poke bowl I ordered. It is your typical poke place where you get to pick your base and I picked brown rice and zucchini noodles. I selected 2 proteins (salmon and tuna) and I had a bunch of toppings of corn, edamame, ginger, carrots, hijiki, and cucumber. I also added some crunch ingredients like fried shallots and fried onions. My sauce was the ponzu and it was flavorless and I think the reason for my disappointment with my poke bowl.  My friend had the Bomb sauce and the spicy tuna for one of her protein choices and she liked her meal much better. This review is for my choices.",0
19294,"Title: A Kosher Delight Close to Synagogues

I recently visited a charming local pizza joint that stands out for its kosher offerings - a thoughtful touch for a religiously observant clientele, especially given the proximity of nearby synagogues. It's also conveniently open one hour post-Shabbat, perfect for a quick bite.

My experience was largely positive; the highlight was the vegetable pizza slice, reminiscent of a delectable eggplant bruschetta. I also tried the spinach and feta slice, which didn't disappoint. However, the accompanying garlic knots were a letdown - too hard for my liking. Additionally, the pricing felt steep at nearly $13 for two slices and three knots.

Despite the minor setbacks, the place has its merits, and I would give it another chance for that delightful vegetable pizza alone.

Rating: 4/5 stars",1
2766,"My partner and I chose this restaurant for our Valentine's Day dinner and it proved to be a sensational choice. Though the tartar had a slightly overpowering pickling taste, it was still enjoyable. Every other dish was a delight to the senses. The Brussels were delectable, the foie gras and bone marrow were indulgent, the sea scallops were cooked to perfection, and the fig and goat cheese toast was the perfect blend of sweet and savory. The evening was lovely, the portions generous, and the preparation impeccable. I highly recommend a visit if you're looking for an exquisite culinary experience.",1
13693,"Title: A Toast to the Wine, but Food Leaves Room for Improvement

Upon entering the restaurant, the ambiance is immediately struck by the heat. Despite the presence of ceiling fans, the open kitchen's warmth pervades the dining area, making it uncomfortably stuffy, despite the attempt to cool it with modestly sized AC units.

Aesthetically, the restaurant is pleasing with its chic wine wall decor and impressive floor-to-ceiling windows contributing to a vibrant setting. Wine aficionados would revel in the extensive selection available, complementing a concise yet efficient food menu. Prices are quite reasonable, which is a pleasant surprise.

The culinary experience, however, falls a touch short of exceptional. The Branzino fillet lacked seasoning and was partnered with disappointingly overdone zucchini. The high point was the Truffle Mac and cheese, standing out as the star dish. Grilled octopus had a nice char but tipped slightly into the realm of overcooking. A daily special, the burrata, showcased a delightful freshness and was notably silky. Regrettably, the risotto should be bypassed on future visits, as it was overly salted and lacked any distinctive flavors.

In summary, while the food did not entirely meet expectations, the experience wasn't all lost. The venue's wine and some of the side dishes are worth returning for; however, I would be reluctant to recommend a full dinner service based on this visit.",1
14999,"Title: A Christmas Eve Feast at Rahi

Rahi, an upscale Indian Fusion restaurant tucked away in the Village, proved to be a culinary gem after a strenuous Christmas Eve search. The tasting menu is nothing short of exceptional—each dish crafted with love, care, and a symphony of spices. The plethora of options available is impressive, ensuring an exciting journey of flavors and textures.

The visual and gustatory elements of Rahi's food are perfectly synchronized. Standout dishes included the fiery yet irresistible 6 Chili 5 Spice Cauliflower, and the Banana Leaf Chicken, which boasted one of the most striking presentations I've ever encountered—enveloped in flavors that matched its beauty. The charred perfection and succulent interior of the grilled Lamb stole the show for me personally.

Accompaniments like mountains of fluffy Basmati Rice and perfectly baked Naan Bread were the ideal complements to the mains. Additionally, the service was exemplary; the staff was notably patient and attentive, especially when guiding my in-laws—an experience not versed in fine dining—through the menu to accommodate their dietary needs.

A considerable expense at $75 per person for a five-course meal, but Rahi’s culinary experience justifies the investment. It's an indulgence that's well worth it for a special occasion like ours.",1
20137,"Super great cozy spot with an overwhelming / infinity of menu choices, but really solid food and nice service. Sat quickly without a reservation and considered the epic menu. 6 pages of everything from sushi to Don to ramen and 1000 things in between. And a specials sheet packed like a high school formula reference with another 30 or so dishes.Had the crab croquettes which were basically like little fried potato cakes and the diced octopus to start. Overall good, but the octopus was a bit chewy / spicy and no crab was witnessed.Went with the ramen which had a really solid broth and pork, but tiny noodles. Good, but not amazing.Overall really nice dinner, but maybe with some more menu magic it could have been even better.",0
17303,"I enjoyed the vegetarian ramen here, though a friend says she likes the veggie ramen at the Westside location better. This broth is fairly strongly soy-flavored. We had a bit of a wait when we arrived. You can bring your coffee into the waiting area, but not into the dining area. The truffle fries were nice, though truffle flavour is sometimes a bit too subtle for me.",0
15307,"Title: A Breakfast Gem in NYC - Oscar's Place

Whenever I'm in New York City, Oscar's Place is my essential breakfast destination. The food here is not only fresh and incredibly delicious, but it also arrives promptly, ensuring a smooth start to the morning. Not to mention, the customer service is exceptional, adding to the overall welcoming experience.

Pairing an omelette with their signature mashed potatoes is a must-try – it's a delightful twist that I always look forward to. The outdoor seating is perfect for leisurely people-watching, letting me ease into the day's rhythm amidst the city's buzz.

Despite its smaller size, Oscar's Place exudes a cozy charm that's hard to find elsewhere. It's a spot that has always lived up to my expectations, never once leaving me disappointed. A true breakfast haven in the heart of NYC.",1
13326,"Title: Spacious New Thai Chain Delights with Familiar Flavors

I recently stumbled upon a newly opened branch of the beloved Top Thai from Greenwich, and it did not disappoint. The new location is impressively spacious, easily triple the size of the original, allowing for a more comfortable dining experience.

Though they're still awaiting their liquor license, the service was highly accommodating – our waiter suggested we grab beer from across the street and kindly waived the corkage fee. This gesture was much appreciated and added to the relaxed atmosphere of the evening.

The menu offered the classic flavors I adore from Top Thai. The premium appetizer platter was a hit at our table; the steak was flavorful, the steamed shrimp dumplings delicate, but the star was the Top Thai spring rolls, with their perfect balance of crispy exterior and succulent chicken interior.

The red snapper with basil sauce was a standout entree – incredibly tasty without being overpoweringly spicy – it's a must-try. The beef pad Thai was decent, and the chicken Top Thai curry was satisfactory, although not remarkable.

For those seeking more room and equally delicious Thai cuisine, this new branch is the place to go. Don't forget to try their fish dishes and bring cash for a handy 10% discount on your meal.",1
209,"Super delicious and cute spot in little Italy!!!! Aunt Jakes is a place I recommend to people who want good italian food, but also may be a little picky. The way the menu is built you can get as creative or as plain as you want when picking your pasta dish. All the pasta is homemade too so it is delicious and makes the experience feel ~cool~ for those who arent used to fresh pasta! The portions are also HUGE so there is plenty of opportunity to share! Squid ink pasta is my personal favorite.It can certainly get busy so I recommend making a reservation, but thats true for most places in little italy, especially on the weekends. Good place for really any kind of outing and any size group!I am a frequent flyer here and will definitely return.",0
11350,"Title: Happy Hour Delight with Surprisingly Hearty Dumplings

Walking into the restaurant, the Happy Hour promotion offering $1 dumplings was simply too enticing to pass up. The dumplings, reminiscent of those found in the frozen section of 99 Ranch Market, offered a comforting familiarity, proving to be satisfying despite their grocery-store counterpart. The siu mai stood out, delivering meaty and robust flavors that were a highlight of the meal.

One adventurous choice was a vibrant green veggie dumpling. Its startling hue gave pause, suggesting the potential overuse of food coloring; however, it was pleasantly palatable. Less conventional was their version of dim sum mustard, which deviated from the traditional but was an interesting twist.

From a cost perspective, the regular pricing seemed steep compared to what one might be accustomed to in Los Angeles, but the quality of the meal made up for it. While there may be room for minor improvements, the experience was positive overall. For an impromptu dumpling evening, this spot certainly delivered.",1
1969,"Title: Quick Service and Hearty Eats at Local BBQ Joint

I recently dined at a local BBQ spot known for its self-service charm. Ordering is a breeze at the counter, and the staff proved to be exceptionally kind, replacing my meal with a smile after a clumsy mishap in the pickup area.

The food was a mixed bag but mostly hit the mark. The brisket, albeit a tad dry, was salvaged by a delicious sauce, transforming it into a delectable dish. The pulled pork, however, was the star of the show: juicy, tender, and packed with flavor—it's the dish that keeps me coming back for more.

Accompaniments included a broccoli slaw that provided a crunchy contrast to the meat's tenderness—a refreshing addition to the plate. Unfortunately, the sweet corn fitters fell short, arriving undercooked and not quite living up to expectations—I'll be skipping those on future visits.

All in all, this BBQ joint delivers where it counts. I'm excited to see what other culinary delights await in my next food adventure!",1
20058,"Title: A Saucy Slice of Heaven at Sauce

I recently visited Sauce, a pizzeria renowned for its variety and distinctive side of sauce with each slice. The adventure included the cheese, vodka, pepperoni, heritage sausage, and al pastor slices, with the upside down cheese left for a future visit.

Every slice invites a personal twist with the tangy side sauce, perfect for drizzling or crust-dipping. The standout for me was the pepperoni, delivering a robust flavor that edged out the creamy vodka and classic cheese slices which were also delightful.

The al pastor was a bold choice, zesty with jalapeños, offering a spicy twist to an already exciting menu. However, the heritage sausage slice fell a tad short on the meaty expectations, but this minor misstep couldn’t overshadow the overall excellent pizza experience.

Sauce stands out as a top-tier pizza joint where each slice is a testament to their commitment to taste and quality. Highly recommend for any pizza enthusiast looking to add a little extra tang to their slice of life!",1
20625,"This restaurant is a fantastic spot for anyone in the mood for straightforward, casual eats. We indulged in an assortment of seven delicious empanadas and started off with a mouth-watering nacho appetizer. The only regret was not having enough room to enjoy even more of their tasty offerings! Highly recommend for a laid-back dining experience.",1
11018,"Title: Mixed Feelings at a Trendy Spot

My recent dining experience was a mixture of highs and lows. We kicked things off with the mozzarella sticks, which were tasty but scant – just four for $13 seemed steep. Next up was the tie-dye pizza, boasting a remarkable crispy thin crust that truly stood out. Unfortunately, the sauce was too sweet for my palate, clashing with my expectations of traditional pizza flavors, and leaving me longing for the more savory marinara that accompanied the appetizer. While this place has its charms, my personal preferences mean I likely won't return – it's worth a one-time visit for the curious.",1
11943,"Upon entering the bustling Moonrise, we snagged the last two seats at the bar and were warmly greeted by the affable bartender, Max. The chilly draft was the only hiccup in an otherwise cozy ambiance, given the single-door entry.

Service was prompt and hospitable, including a complimentary shot of sake upon arrival and another shared with the amiable owner, Jake. Despite a slight wait for our food, which seemed fitting for an izakaya atmosphere, our patience was rewarded.

The culinary journey began with a perfectly fried soft shell crab sandwich and chicken karaage, both exquisite. We continued with a doughy yet flavorful seafood pancake and a mini ramen that faltered only in its overly salty broth.

In summary, Moonrise shines with its lively vibe, exceptional service, and mostly stellar fare. It's a spot where good drinks and good food pave the way for a memorable evening.",1
338,"After a 36-year hiatus from the Beach, I revisited my old stomping grounds with an eagerness to introduce my wife, an international newcomer, to a classic American meatloaf. To our slight disappointment, meatloaf was off the menu, leading us to pivot to alternative options. We settled on the sirloin burger and fish and chips, both of which impressed us, earning a solid four-star rating for the food.

The ambiance, however, didn't strike the same chord, coming in at three stars due to the overly energetic chatter from adjacent diners and the somewhat cramped seating arrangements. Nevertheless, the night was injected with enjoyment, lifted by the courteous and attentive service from the wait staff. It was a pleasing return to a place woven into my past, now shared with my wife.",1
20872,"Title: A Brunch to Remember at Michael White's Culinary Gem

My recent visit to Michael White's restaurant for brunch was a delightful experience that left a lasting impression. The establishment lived up to its reputation with outstanding food and attentive service. Despite a minor mix-up with our order, where we received an unintended pasta dish instead of the Black Ink Pasta we asked for, the staff handled the situation impeccably. Not only did they promptly bring us the correct dish, but they also gifted the mistake, turning a small oversight into a testament to their customer service excellence.

The pastas, freshly made in-house, highlighted the difference that handcrafted care brings to a dish. The generous portion of charcuterie was a savory feast, notably for the abundant and high-quality prosciutto served. Furthermore, the burger, a dry-aged creation, was a standout item—juicy, flavorful, and cooked to perfection, paired wonderfully with delectable onion rings.

This visit has assured me that I will be returning, eager to experience their dinner offerings. Michael White's establishment is a must-visit for anyone looking for a top-tier dining experience.",1
12986,"Title: A Strong Contender for Midtown's Finest Fish and Chips

As a connoisseur of the classic Fish and Chips paired adeptly with a pint of Guinness, my quest led me to an impressive spot in Midtown. The chips delivered, achieving a delightful crispness. An exceptional tarter sauce tickled my palate with its malt vinegar infusion, honoring tradition by having malt vinegar at the ready—a crucial touch.

The fish itself was a testament to the kitchen's mastery: flaky, moist, and encased in a beautifully browned, crunchy batter. Unfortunately, one misstep prevented a flawless victory—the fish's lack of intrinsic seasoning. While the table salt offered a makeshift solution, it just couldn't replicate the depth that well-seasoned batter and fish would provide.

This place is on the brink of perfection, and I'm eager to return. With a minor tweak to their seasoning approach, I'm ready to upgrade my experience to a resounding five stars.",1
13669,Understaffed but otherwise great tasting food and good selection.  Especially liked the dosas which are tasty and large portions.  The fresh lime soda is also very tasty (though maybe an acquired taste due to presence of the Indian spices).  The space is nice and airy when they have all the windows open and gives off a pleasant summery vibe.  Enjoyable experience.,0
10890,"I was skeptical about this place but finally tried it and it was good!WAIT: Came on a Sunday night around 5:30 pm and was seated almost right away.  If you come later the place is pretty small and fills up quickly so there might be a wait.ATMOSPHERE: It is very small and narrow inside.  There is a small bar/high top area to sit that faces a wall and then there are tables that probably seat about 10-12 people total. The kitchen is ""open"" so you can see them making the ramen.FOOD: They have a good amount of choices for those that like thin ramen noodles or thicker curly noodles (like myself).TONTORO PORK - I got this because it had my name written all over it.  Thick, chewy noodles with a fatty and flavorful pork broth.  The noodles are not the thickest or chewiest I've had but they were pretty good.  They were al dente, tasty and had a good amount of the soup broth that covered it.  The broth itself was definitely pretty thick and not for the feint of heart.  It almost reminded me of a gravy but not that thick.  The pork was the medallion type with grill marks on it.  It could have been fattier so not my favorite.  The egg was soft boiled (but costs extra).Honestly, this was way better than I expected.  If I'm in the area, I would definitely come back to this ramen and tell others to try if it they have similar taste in ramen as I do.",0
2840,"I recently visited a local AYCE hot pot restaurant where for just $25, the experience was delightful. The service impressed me with its speed and attentiveness, particularly in maintaining our broth levels without a hitch. The variety of food, including succulent beef, tender fish fillets, and an array of tofu options, was a highlight. They also offer some unique items like mussels and sausage – we sampled these and they were a pleasant twist to the usual hot pot fare.

Admittedly, I was surprised that a hot pot staple like bok choy wasn't available, which was a slight letdown. However, the birthday perk is a fantastic touch – dine within three days of your special day, and your meal is complimentary. Plus, they have this quirky tradition of a 'dancing monkey man' that will sing for the occasion upon request.

Another pro tip: book through Seated to receive 21% cashback on your meal. It's an unbeatable deal that adds even more value to an already fantastic dining experience.",1
10318,Really great use of flavors but way to expensive for the quantity being served. Each dish was 5 bites and the bill ended up with a 250$ bill. It's a great place to check out if you want to sample a bunch of plates. Really cool interior and a decent staff.,0
16787,Had a great time at this cool bar with live music adding to the atmosphere. The staff were welcoming and the beets peach salad special was a hit – truly delicious.

1264,"Title: A Slice of NY Heaven in Ohio

I recently had a delightful dining experience at a local restaurant that left my pizza-loving heart utterly satisfied. As someone who considers themselves a New York pizza connoisseur temporarily based in Southwest Ohio, I approached the extensive menu with both excitement and nostalgia. The array of pizza options was overwhelming in the best way possible, and the toughest part of my meal was deciding which slices to choose.

I can't confidently declare it the best pizza in all of New York, but for a New Yorker like me, every bite was a cherished taste of home. The restaurant's central location was convenient, and the atmosphere during off-hours was pleasantly unhurried. In addition to pizza, they offer a salad and pasta bar, but the standout deal was undoubtedly the two-slice and fountain drink combo for under $10 – an absolute steal.

My visit was made even more memorable by my niece's first encounter with authentic NY pizza, an experience that won't be forgotten any time soon. For a quick, affordable, and truly enjoyable lunch, this place is a gem. Whether you're a die-hard pizza enthusiast or just looking for a satisfying meal, you won't be disappointed here.",1
13451,"I'm not vegan, but I found myself at By Chloe twice during a recent visit to NYC- eating healthy while traveling means more energy for exploring! I tried their black bean burger both times, with the matcha beauty latte- a nice mid-afternoon late lunch. Since I went at off-peak times, seating was available and I didn't feel rushed. By Chloe offers fast casual, plant-based meals that would appeal to non-vegans as well. None of the menu items are too pretentious- you can get your standard burger and fries, just without the real meat. The staff was friendly and efficient. This is a nice central area close to Trader Joe's, Bed Bath & Beyond, etc.- perfect spot to replenish & take a breather while out and about in the city. I'm sure I'll return!",0

12976,"BELIEVE THE HYPECame here last night with some out of town friends and my parents, who all coincidentally converged on the city on the same day.  I had heard great things about this place from friends, but I admit I was a bit hesitant due to the Meatpacking location and the ""hotspot"" reputation.  I can confidently say, do not hesitate to come here.The service and food were stellar.  Not much for ambiance, but you definitely get the after work corporate expense account type of crowd.  Regardless, it was well worth the trip due to the first two factors.First, we had the puff pastry special with some type of cheese in the middle.  They were little bites of heaven.  A bit disappointed that the kitchen refused to add a sixth puff for a party of six to an order that normally comes with five, even though we offered to pay extra, but I'm glad we tried them.We decided to order appetizers and all split the Tomahawk steak at the end, which ended up being a stellar plan.  I have to say, the lobster mac & cheese was other-worldly... And this is coming from a New England girl, so my standards for anything lobster are very high.  Everything else we ordered was nothing short of delicious:- The Catch ceviche - more lobster - divine- Lobster rolls - New England seal of approval- Grilled Spanish octopus - perfectly done and great accompaniments - Crispy shrimp - not something I might normally order, but surprisingly tasty- Scallop gnocchi - the gnocchi had little orange sweet potato surprise inside of every bite!Finally, we had the 25-day dry-aged Tomahawk, cooked to a perfect medium rare, and a huge hit for the whole table.  Also, the truffle fries were delicious, and also a necessity, as we could smell truffle from the moment we walked in.Overall, would definitely come back here.  Hopefully on a corporate expense account next time.  The prices are a bit high.  :)  Cocktails were great too.  Try it!",0
12920,"Title: A Night of Culinary Delights and Soju Cheers at [Restaurant Name]

Last night's feast at [Restaurant Name] was an adventure for the taste buds, one that required strategic Soju breaks amidst a smorgasbord of flavors. Our party of six dove into a diverse menu, kicking off with succulent shrimp and pork tacos, followed by sticky-sweet honey BBQ wings that set the bar high from the get-go.

The Korean scallion pancake was a revelation, generously topped with bacon and easily became one of my top picks. The steamed buns were a festival of flavors with the bulgogi and duck varieties; particularly the latter, which was a concoction of the sweetest duck encased in the softest buns imaginable.

A special shout-out must be given to the tteok & cheese – a harmonious marriage of rice gnocchi and a luscious cheese pool, which demanded a pause for the obligatory melt-in-your-mouth photo. The homemade pickles offered a tangy interlude before we dove back into another round of Soju.

The popcorn chicken was a crisp and flavorful addition, but the show-stopper came in the form of a Yelp check-in surprise – spinning the wheel landed us a batch of truffle fries, which arrived to our cheer and immediate delight.

Sharing was caring as we opted for family-style small plates, ensuring each person got a taste of everything. Recommendations? You can't go wrong with any dish, but do yourself a favor: go have a sake bomb, indulge in a soft and sticky duck steamed bun, and give that wheel a spin. You can thank us later for the tip. Cheers to [Restaurant Name] for a memorable evening!",1

The place serves up freshness that you can taste, especially in their salads which are nothing short of amazing. I indulged in the goat cheese and beet salad, and it quickly climbed to the top of my favorites list. Their dedication to sustainable farming and hydroponic cultivation methods is an added boon to the dining experience. Impressively, I enjoyed two pizzas without the heaviness that typically follows such a feast. This spot earns my high recommendation for anyone seeking a guilt-free and delightful meal.",1

It is a chicken casserole with blur corn chips, tomatillo, and sour cream. I think they originally forgot my sour cream, but got some later. The staff mixes up the dish and serves a portion of it table side to start. The dish reminded me a lot of spinach and artichoke dip, but was rather good. It needed more chips imho, but the serving size is plenty for two meals.My friend got the steak fajitas and they were the standard affair served on a sizzling plate.

The cauliflower, in particular, is a game-changer, boldly challenging any preconceived notions about meatless meals. I give this gem two enthusiastic thumbs up!",1
16334,"Title: Tasty, Swift, and Pricy Evening at [Restaurant Name]

My recent dining experience at [Restaurant Name] left my taste buds delighted but my desire for a leisurely dinner somewhat unfulfilled. The menu, albeit expensive, boasted a tantalizing array of dishes: the prime brisket stole the show with its rich flavors, closely followed by the succulent marinated kalbi. The assorted mushrooms, though pricey, added a delicious variety to the meal. While the pork belly and marinated pork short ribs were satisfactory, they didn't leave a significant impression.

Timing is everything at this establishment. Arriving before the post-work crowd around 5:20 pm, we avoided the notorious wait time and were seated immediately. Service, however, was double-edged; the staff's efficiency bordered on haste. It felt like a race against the clock as dishes practically flew from grill to plate, all underscored by a soundtrack that seemed to be set on fast-forward. 

In conclusion, if you're seeking delectable food and don't mind the cost or the rush, [Restaurant Name] is worth a visit. But for those who prefer a more relaxed dining experience, you might want to look elsewhere.",1
